8. LLM Topic Analysis:


1. Quality Filter:
Description: We aim to classify posts on whether they are rants or not and provide a count of the posts classified
as rants to understand the overall quality of the content. 
We use the sentiment analysis tool called VADER which is a part of the NLTK library.

Results:
r/teenagers = Total number of rants: 71/4469 = 1.59%
r/parenting = Total number of rants: 0/1206 = 0.00%

2. Question Detection: 
Description: Check for posts that contain questions based on common question words and a question mark.
We use simple regex to identify such sentences.

Results:
r/teenagers = Total number of posts with questions: 2322/4469 = 51.96%
r/parenting = Total number of posts with questions: 1183/1206 = 98.09%

3. Scenario Detection:
Description: We aim to classify posts based on whether or not they describe a scenario. We will be acheiving this by analyzing
the pronouns and verbs using dependency parsing with SpaCy where pronouns combined with action verbs will identify as a scenario.

Results:
r/teenagers = Total number of posts with scenarios: 2199/4469 = 49.21%
r/parenting = Total number of posts with scenarios: 1180/1206 = 97.84%

4. Advice Extraction: 
Description: We aim to identify posts that have advice-giving language by finding those with common keywords like "I suggest", "My recommendation",
"Try doing", and such. 

Results:
r/teenagers = Total number of posts with advice: 300/4469 = 6.71%
r/parenting = Total number of posts with advice: 304/1206 = 25.21%

5. Cluster Analysis: Created a script to analyze and group posts based on similar topics. Results are not as expected. Grouping into topics do not turn out good due to the content present
in the posts.

6. Topic Analysis: Provided similar results as Cluster Analysis.
