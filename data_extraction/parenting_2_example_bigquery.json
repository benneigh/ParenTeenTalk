  "selftext": "I have an 11 year old who has been wearing glasses since he was a toddler. He has broken so many glasses over the years that we now have him contribute to the cost of new ones. He isn\u0027t doing it on purpose. He\u0027s one of those kids that gets so into what he is doing that everything else gets disregarded. He plays football, basketball, baseball, and lacrosse competively and has sports glass that he has also broke but his regular glasses get broken in random pick up games at the park or games in friends backyards. He broke a pair this morning playing basketball at a nearby park. \n\nI have told him to bring his sports glasses but he doesn\u0027t like the way they look and if he forgets them he isn\u0027t coming all the way back home to get them. He left this morning before I even got up so I couldn\u0027t check to make sure he had them. For a while I made him take them but he wouldn\u0027t even bother putting them on (even the ones he picked out). That\u0027s why we started having him come up with the cost if he breaks them before the warranty expires. \n\nHe wants contacts and I am unsure of it. The eye doctor said that he doesn\u0027t normally recommend them until after a child starts puberty because the eyes can change so much but I have heard stories of kids his age getting contacts. Should we seek out a second opinion or is 11 too young for contacts?\n\nI should point out that he is generally a mature and responsible kid. I think he would be fine with taking care of his contacts. He has never had any problems with hygiene. He doesn\u0027t have to be reminded to complete chores or do school work. We give him a lot of freedom because he has earned our trust. The only problem we have ever had with him is the repeat broken glasses. \n\n",

  "title": "How to dodge an inappropriate classmate?",
  "selftext": "My 6 year old daughter is starting first grade. She met and befriended another little girl two years ago in the PreK class and let me tell you, this girl is a nightmare. It started with bullying my daughter about not wearing dresses/jewelry, then not having her ears pierced and just generally being unkind/exclusive. She has bullied other classmates and we\u0027ve witnessed several outbursts where she was violent with her parents/sibling. My daughter is incredibly kind, sensitive and ultimately very forgiving. She has started every day hoping this other child will be nice and every day comes home with hurt feelings.\n\nThen, just as school resumed after the winter break, this other child backed my daughter into a corner and insisted my child touch her \"privates\" or they \"wouldn\u0027t be friends anymore\". After a lot of coercing, my daughter did it. The other girl told her that it is a secret and she would be in big trouble if she told anyone about it. Immediately after school ended my daughter disclosed what had happened. I called the school, they apologized and set up a meeting for the girls and the parents to meet and discuss what is appropriate. The meeting ended with the other parent and the school being so relieved that this incident wouldn\u0027t affect their friendship. I felt pretty sick about it, as I worked in child welfare for years and I think this was kind of swept under the rug. While I understand that children often mutually explore their bodies and sexuality, this was not a \"show me yours, I\u0027ll show you mine\" situation. There was secrecy and there was a threat. The other child likely needs help, the other parent didn\u0027t seem to be terribly upset about it and my child has moved on, not concerned about this incident or the regularly occurring bullying. While I\u0027m glad it hasn\u0027t affected her day-to-day life, I hate that she gravitates towards this child.\n\nThe mother of this child continues to text me, asking to set up play dates with the girls because her daughter just can\u0027t wait to see mine. Mine is indifferent to the idea. I\u0027ve tried to just dodge multiple play dates saying that we are unavailable. The girls will be starting back at school in the next few weeks. Can I just ghost the mom? Do I address that her child has been unkind and inappropriate? How do I separate our family from theirs without offending them?\n\nTL;DR: A classmate has been bullying my daughter and forced my daughter to touch her inappropriately. The mother of the classmate insists they are best friends and all is well, trying to set up play dates. How do I avoid them tactfully?",

  "title": "Sexually curious at 8 years old? Normal???",
  "selftext": "*** trigger warning***\n\nHi all. \nThis is going to be long, but I am just needing some advice and I guess some consolation. Obviously anonymous because well, I don’t want any backlash IRL.\n\nBackground: I have a childhood of sexual abuse from ages 5 to 11 years old by my own father, so what has happened has hit home harder than most other people, I suppose. But we’ll get to that.\n\nMy son (5) and his step brother (8) were playing outside in the pool. I turned away to grab some water and I heard my son say: “stop touching my pee pee!” to his step brother. \n\nI didn’t get mad at him, I didn’t yell, I didn’t acknowledge it, I just said: “behave.” I blanked out sort of, honestly, but I’m glad because then I didn’t overreact and scare either of them.\n\nI stayed there to supervise as usual and my son had to go to the restroom. My husband taught him to pee standing up so he peed standing up at the edge of the pool. His step brother went next to him and was looking down at his privates. I got upset and just told them to come inside. I got them changed and the day went on without any other things happening.\n\nNow, earlier this year in March or April, my step son had gotten into trouble for touching another boy at his school. I don’t really have a day in discipline due to his bio mom (she told my step son that he does not have to listen to me, only to his dad) and my husband sorta just blew it off because he knew his son would never do anything like that. \n\nThat incident raised a red flag for me because he was still only 7. My husband has also confided in me that he has caught his son looking at women without clothes on in his tablet. My husband is a bit nerdy so he was able to block any websites containing any type of those things.\n\nHe lives with us 50/50. His bio-mom is a weekend parent so 50% of the time, he is with grandparents. I am assuming he is seeing these things when he is with them since they just give him his tablet and call it a day. It’s only him at his grandparents and my husband has never ever mentioned of any weird things happening there at their place. But he has mentioned that bio mom’s brother (who is 10) looks at porn and I’m thinking maybe that is where all this is coming from as well.\n\nAfter that incident with my son, I am extra cautious. \n\nI spoke with my son and had the: don’t let ANYONE touch you down there talk. \n\nI did tell my husband what happened but my husband said that “it is normal, boys do that.” \n\nI don’t think it’s normal for a 8 year old to be touching a 4 year old. I don’t think it’s normal for a 8 year old to be staring at another boys penis. I don’t think it’s normal for an 8 year old to be looking at pornographic things. I just feel like it’s way too soon to be going through this.\n\nI told my husband to please have a talk with his son, but he still thinks it’s unnecessary. I am not expecting punishment; I just want my husband to acknowledge this might become an issue and we need to stop it in its tracks.\n\nWhat can I do? Am I overreacting? I also feel very hurt because he knows about my childhood and what happened and it feels like he also brushing that off as: “it’s normal.” I just want him to see that I am reacting this way because of what happened to me and I don’t want my son or our other two baby girls to go through anything like I did. \n\nI don’t know how to convince or away my husband on talking to his son about this. I don’t want something worse to happen to the point where I’m going to have to make my husband choose between our girls and my son and his son. I will leave if anything happens to my son and our girls and it’s completely proven that his son did something to them.\n\nTD;LR\nStepson touched my son, has a small history of seeing some porn, and I don’t know how to handle it.

  "selftext": "xposted from r/relationships because it was removed stating this would be a better sub to post to.\n\nMy story is long I know, but I would appreciate any insight, advise, or any words you have to offer. Thank you for reading\n\nWhen I got pregnant at 16 (on my 16th birthday, thanks Jagermeister) I thought I had it all figured out. Bill \\[29m\\] and I were going to buy a house, make up a nursery, have a family and live happily ever after. With him working at a thrift store and me being a high school drop out, this obviously never came to fruition.  We both struggled with depression and the small one bedroom we had moved into quickly turned into a landfill. This is not an exaggeration.\n\nBy the time Leo came we had somewhat gotten out shit together, enough to have a \"nursery\" for him in our bedroom. I tried so hard to keep the house maintainable, but it was an uphill battle. Eventually, this would be the only spot in the house that was any sort of clean. By the time Leo was around three months I had to stop breastfeeding due to numerous complications. For my 17th birthday we dropped Leo off at Liza\u0027s (Bill\u0027s mom) house and he picked up some weed for us. This was the first time I ever tried smoking and it easily became a habit for us. When our dealer left town, I reached out to a friends older brother Graham (28m) who I knew sold.\n\nI started picking up from Graham on my own, and one of these times he offered me an adderall. I took it, and next time I asked for more. I didn\u0027t tell Bill about this. Eventually, Graham and I transitioned to a full blown affair. I would sneak off to see him, telling Bill that I was going out with girlfriends. I would call Bill at night, saying we had just gotten so caught up, I\u0027m going to crash here. Ultimately, after a few months of the BS I finally broke it off with Bill to be with Graham and moved into my moms place. I was still 17.\n\nBill and I worked out a custody agreement where we would each have Leo overnight at our respective homes, him also having moved back in with his mother. To avoid negative discourse over custody we made his mother Leo\u0027s legal guardian, keeping out parental rights as well. I was meant to have my son three nights a week. I began canceling these overnight visits and just picked him up for the day. Soon I began canceling these day visits as well, until finally I just stopped showing up. The last time I saw my son was for my 18th birthday. We went to a petting zoo, played in a corn maze. I dropped him off at Liza\u0027s and I never picked him up again. I never called Liza or Bill again. And they didn\u0027t bother calling me.\n\nDuring this time I was still with Graham in what would become a toxic, controlling, and abusive relationship. I would spend the next two years on a steady stream of adderall which he had a **massive** prescription for, and when that ran out we would buy some coke. Harboring feelings of deep shame and depression for leaving my son, I was in a full blown massive depression. Somewhere in between all the drugs, weed, vodka and psychedelics, I improperly used my birth control and got pregnant. again. Graham was on board, ready to be a dad. And then he wasnt. We would fight, he would leave, I would beg for him to come back; a cycle that had persisted for our entire relationship. I would catch him talking to girls and he would get angry and say its just talk. I bought it. I \u0027loved\u0027 him. When we found out the pregnancy was twins he finally split for good, and I was stuck in the apartment we had moved into and paid for with his trust fund. I had alienated my mother who, beginning a new marriage, couldn\u0027t support an addict teenager in an abusive relationship. I reached out to her anyway and she let me come home.\n\nClean for weeks for the first time in years, I decided to get an abortion. My mother bought me a ticket to Mexico and I went and did a work exchange for the next three months. I healed, I was sober, I was free. I returned home and got a job in a burger joint and quickly moved into higher end kitchens, where I still find myself today. At that burger joint a met a boy who today would become my husband. I found passion and drive for my work. I\u0027ve enrolled in school to be an engineer. I am alive and feel like a real functionable human for the first time....ever. I was a child before, when I left. I was selfish and scared. I want to reach out. I want to be a part of my sons life. And I know the sentiment is selfish I want Leo to be a part of MY life. We want to start a family and I want him to know his siblings, to love them.\n\nI dont know how to have more children when I left one behind. I dont know how to connect after six years of desertion and selfishness. I dont know what to say, or if I even have any right to do so. I dont expect to walk in and be a mother to him. I dont ever expect to be able to be a mother to him. But a person in his life, maybe. I can do that. I just want them to know that I am here. In what ever capacity they want or need. Maybe they just need money, I dont care. It\u0027s time for me to at least be available to them, and I need help figuring out how.\n\ntldr; left my son when he was two years old and haven been in contact since. After working for six years to get my life together i feel like a person who could be in his life again, but i dont know if its the right thing to do. Theres so many more nuances to this story, so please let me know if anything needs clarifying. Thank you",

  "selftext": "My husband and I agonized about the decision of whether or not to delay kindergarten for our oldest. He was born right before the cutoff and we read about how much of an advantage it can be to be the oldest in your grade instead of the youngest in your grade. My husband is a teacher and a coach so he was aware of the advantages of redshirting when it comes to academics and athletics. We weren\u0027t concerned about academics since he was on target developmentally but there were some concerns about whether he could handle it. He started school right after turning 5 and there were some struggles at first. He was smaller than everyone and noticeably younger than everyone. We considered pulling him out and thought we made the wrong decison. We decided to wait it out after much conversation and I think it is the greatest thing we did for him. \n\nBeing around the older kids forced him to level up. He had to grow up to fit in with his classmates. Don\u0027t underestimate the power of positive peer pressure. He rose to the occasion and I believe redshirting and putting him with a younger crowd would have delayed maturity. He acted like a kindergartener because he was a kindergartener even though he was the youngest. I wouldn\u0027t have wanted him acting like a kindergartener when he was supposed to be a first grader. \n\nMy son is 10 now and will be starting 6th grade right after his 11th birthday. He is one of the mature kids among his friends and we expect much more out of him than a lot of his friends parents do. There are downsides with any decision but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s anything major. The \"big\" issue at the moment is that a lot of boys are starting to hit puberty and he might be a little while away. He plays sports and having another year to grow may have been better but he rises to the occasion because that\u0027s what we have always expected from him. But he constantly shows us that we made the right choice. He has helped put an end to a kid being bullied and is such a great leader on his teams and in school. He is so excited to start middle school now and fits in well with his peers and even kids who are a grade or two ahead. He is used to being the youngest and smallest in his grade so it\u0027s his normal. I\u0027m glad we made the decision we did despite the early struggles. Don\u0027t be discouraged if you young kindergartener is a little behind to start the year. It might all be worth it in the end. ",

  "title": "10 yr old doesn\u0027t talk to adults",
  "selftext": "Im posting on behalf of my mom. My 10 year old brother has always been super shy and never talked to adults, but talks to kids his own age fine. When he was younger we thought he\u0027d outgrow it but now hes older, starting his puberty years, and still refuses to talk to adults! He hides or just stands there and says nothing, not even a \"hi\". When he was younger my mom took him to get evaluated but they said there was nothing wrong with him and that he would outgrow it. My mom is very frustrated and doesn\u0027t know what to do about the situation. She can\u0027t sign him up for extracurriculars because he will just stand there and not talk. \n\nI\u0027ve been with my husband for a couple of years and he also barely says anything to him. Sometimes he even acts shy around me! I\u0027m like, I\u0027m your sister! My parents divorced when he was about 2 yrs old so he is always with my mom, and maybe once a week with his dad for a couple of hrs. In his free time he loves playing video games, specifically Fortnite.\n\nAny ideas on how we can help him?? Is this normal for a 10 yr old?? \n\nTL;DR: 10 yr old brother refuses to talk to adults. Any advice?",

  "title": "Birth trauma",
  "selftext": "Today is one of those days. I avoid thinking about it most of the time but sometimes I can’t help it, and I end up back in that room alone- without my baby, without my husband. \nI do not like hospitals. I never have, and after being sexually assaulted by a doctor years ago, I liked them even less. \nI planned a home birth with a wonderful midwife and had everything ready to go when my blood test came back irregular. I had ICP and was no longer a candidate for a home birth. I would have to be induced. \nI was devastated, I felt out of control and was terrified. I chose not to tell my family or my in laws since I don’t have a great relationship with any of them and knew they’d stress me out further. My in laws found out when my husband took off work and made the week prior to my induction miserable. I still haven’t spoken to them and don’t plan on it. \nI wanted to experience natural childbirth terribly and after everything fell apart with my home birth I went into a state of depression and wasn’t thinking clearly. I asked for IV pain medicine when they started the induction, hoping to avoid the epidural. It didn’t help and my cervix wasn’t budging. I suffered for two days before they used the foley balloon and at that point I was hallucinating and screaming in pain. It was hellish, and I was suffering. I gave in and asked for the epidural, and within the next twelve hours it was time to push. \nMy son was born in under one hour and he was beautiful. He didn’t cry though, and my midwife called pediatrics and I could see them starting to panic. I didn’t know what the hell was going on, and I was the most scared I have ever been in my life. Nurses flew in and they took my baby and brought him to the table to begin checking him out. The midwife who delivered my baby stood directly between me and my son so that I could not see his precious little self. I yelled and said “move move I can’t see him!!” And she didn’t. I was panicking and hyperventilating and when they took my baby I remember crying out for him and trying to get up to go with him and I couldn’t move. When they left with my baby I told her “you didn’t move when I asked you to” and she said “you wouldn’t have been able to see him anyway”. I would have been able to see him. If she had moved. I was hysterical and could barely breathe. Everyone left the room and I was alone (husband was with the baby in the NICU). I never heard his first cry. \nThe midwife who delivered him came back into the room when it was just me and yelled at me and told me it was “time to get my shit together and act like a mother”. I cursed her out and she left and didn’t return, thankfully. \nWhen I held him before pediatrics arrived my husband took pictures. He recently broke his phone and the only photos I had are now lost. They’re gone forever. \nWhen I was finally able to visit him in the NICU I was not in my right mind, I was in shock and was not thinking clearly. I held his little hand and rubbed his little back and talked to him. I cried and was so happy he was okay. He had transient tachypnea- it was not serious and resolved itself after a day or two with supplemental oxygen. I should have held him, but I didn’t know I could. I think I asked but was told it was best if I didn’t wake him up. I didn’t know I was supposed to stay in the room with him and ended up sleeping in my hospital room leaving my baby alone in the NICU. I didn’t know I was supposed to be there for every feeding, and no one told me I should be (if I were in my right mind I would have had it no other way). When I breastfed him the first time the next day I didn’t get my husband to take pictures, nothing. It breaks my heart. I should have been by his side the moment I was able to be. I should have rolled my wheelchair in there and stayed with him until we went home. I should have been the one who fed him every time. I should have demanded to hold him and do skin to skin that day after golden hour was robbed from us. I don’t know what I was thinking, I’m wondering WHY I wasn’t, how I wasn’t... \nI’m in a lot of pain guys. My heart hurts and it’s hard to reflect on that day without falling apart. No one gets it. No one understands why I keep “living in the past”. \nI can’t forgive myself. I look at his sweet face and wonder how I could have ever left him alone without his mom... I hold myself responsible because I am the only one who can be held responsible. \nI feel empty and helpless because I don’t know how to heal from this. I wish I at least had photos from the day he was born, but I don’t even have those now.\nI can’t rewind time or change anything and now I have to live with knowing I could have done better, but didn’t. \nI’m really suffering, and I know I deserve to be.

  "title": "Parenthood isn\u0027t worth it and it is the saddest and most lonely realization.",
  "selftext": "I have a 3 year old and a 18month year old.\n\n(And just to make it clear, with the second, I got pregnant with her when my oldest was 8 months despite using birth control - I guess were unlucky. We were talking about whether to have a second and \"is everyone right that it gets better\" and leaning towards no when we found out, and abortion didn\u0027t feel right so we did it. \n\nWe love them but we don\u0027t enjoy the day to day of parenting them at all and constantly wish we gave parenthood a miss. And the magical highs that are meant to make it worth it aren\u0027t enough to cancel out the grind. People will probably ask how we can feel that way, but I liken it to a job I used to have a few years ago now. This job paid about $30k more a year than the jobs my friends had and gave an extra 2 weeks vacation than standard under the law and the option to get paid less and \"buy\" another 2 weeks which I always did - and I damn well loved that money and the holidays. But my boss was a creepy misogynistic pig and company culture demanded I just put up with his sleaziness, when not on vacation I was at the office an extra 2 hours a day every day than my friends, I constantly had headaches from the stress, I was expected to answer calls at 7am on a Sunday while everyone else I knew slept. I made more money and got more holidays but my day to day life sucked more than theirs. \n\nI was on a holiday in Brazil for the World Cup with my then fiancee and now husband, and feeling literally sick at the thought of going back when I realized it was not worth it - this 3 weeks of fun holiday didn\u0027t make up for spending the next 6 months miserable and stressed to the point of constant sickness and crying until Christmas rolled around in 6 months time and I got another break from it. I found out the day I got back I was pregnant and stuck it out for the extra money on maternity leave with the intention of not going back afterwards (the company basically mummy-tracks mothers). We were planning on kids - but 4 years from then, not then, but we decided it was obviously meant to be. \n\nBut anyway, my point is that this is how parenthood feels - when my oldest draws me a picture and with hearts because \"I love you mummy\", it is nice, but it doesn\u0027t really cancel out the drain that is the day to day grind and how monotonous and dull parenting has made my life.  Like how that awesome holiday in Brasil was wonderful but didn\u0027t cancel out how shit my life was between holidays. \n\nI just hate it. I hate the lack of money we have now when previously, my job meant that I was financially very comfortable. That trip to Brasil was my last ever exciting trip anywhere and will be for the foreseeable future. I am still at that shitty company because I need the money with kids and most of the extra goes to day care making it feel not worth it but it is important for me to try and stay in the workforce so I don\u0027t have a harder time when I want back in later, we don\u0027t have family living nearby (we are from smaller regional towns and moved to this big city for university and our jobs) so are doing it all on our own and have drifted from most of our friends as we were the first to \"breed\" and we basically made \"parents friends\" but deep down, we don\u0027t really like any of these people they are just our only real option for friends now, we don\u0027t enjoy going to the Wiggles Tour instead of the fun things we used to, and one of our kids as an insulin dependent diabetic and needs expensive treatment that I find difficult to do because I am so squeamish. It has been 4 months and I am still now over the injections making me sick. \n\nI feel like this are the moments where I\u0027m meant to think that having them was all worth it......but I don\u0027t. They are nice, they warm my heart, they make me smile, but it is like that job. A random hug and a \"I love you mummy\" doesn\u0027t make uo for the fact that my life has sucked for the last month - working a job I hate to pay for day care, only having friends I secretly dislike for adult company, dealing with diabetes, and the fact that I aged 15 years in 5 and that my husband and I agree that our life was so much better before getting pregnant and we\u0027d do anything to go back and have not signed up for this life. I hate that I felt pressured to have a shotgun wedding so we were married before our first was born instead of the lovely one we dreamed of. \n\nThe nice moments of parenting are just not worth everything we gave up and all the shit (often literally) we put up with and this is just such a lonely realization when there is nothing you can do other than sucking up what feels like the biggest mistake you ever made in your lives. I dream constantly of where my life could be if I made a different decision - I am 33 and still so young, but I am now chained to the needs of these 2 little people that I love but wish I wasn\u0027t responsible for. I wasn\u0027t ready for them. I was stupid. But they are here now and that is that. I just have to keep sucking it up and it is so hard, especially in a world of happy pinterest mums when you are the regretful mum. I am actually watching the World Cup on TV now in the middle of the night because my 18mo is sick. The house smells faintly of vomit. In my alternate life where I didn\u0027t get pregnant presumably in Brazil, my DH and I would probably be there having fun. Instead I am sitting here trying not to cry because I made a massive mistake and turned my life into something I don\u0027t like and have no choice but to live with the hell every single day. ",

My wife has always been very open with the kids about everything, proper names for body parts, answering every question asked with an age appropriate response (never saying things like “well talk about it when you’re older”) \n\nAnyway, every night before bed our daughter usually comes into our room, she and my wife sit on the bed and my wife brushes and braids her hair, they have been doing this since she was 2, and while my wife recognizes she doesn’t really *need* to this for her anymore they both seem to enjoy it. They usually sit and talk and laugh during.\n\nSo the other night I was in our ensuite, and they came in the room. I don’t think either one realized I was there. My daughter asked my wife about getting her a sex toy. I was losing my shit internally hearing this, but much to my wife’s credit, she stayed calm, asked why she thought she needed one, etc., eventually told her no, she is too young and should learn to use her hands before exploring with toys, and she didn’t think toys would be appropriate for a few years. All in all they probably had a 3 minute discussion then my daughter went to bed and my wife went to tuck in our son. \n\nI used that opportunity to leave the bathroom. My wife came to bed, and never mentioned the conversation she had with our daughter. I didn’t either. \n\nI’ll be honest, im a little bothered by it. Nothing inappropriate was said, and I’m not sure if it’s just my discomfort to thinking of my baby girl like that (I know, she’s not just my daughter, but a person and I need to get over it. And I will, it’s just she’s my little girl) but it also seems kind of strange.

(I hope it’s okay I posted here. If not, let me know!) \n\nThanks!",

Aside from the fact its not my music style listening to the lyrics I thought they seemed inappropriate for young kids. \n\nI found this review \n\"In “Havana” Camila recalls a memorable physical encounter that was “forever in a minute/That summer night in June.” Her partner, she admits, is a man who is “malo,” Spanish for bad. A few lines by guest rapper Young Thug in the track suggest themes such as prostitution and casual sexual encounters.\"\n\nSo in my world that song is a No. \n\nBut what I want to know is... i bet there are patents who play that kind of music in the car when their kids are in it and dont think twice.\n\nI just want to see a show of hands of who is on my side because I am curious how I compare to other parents these days \n",

My husband is currently a stay at home dad and hate it’s. He’s bipolar is it’s leading to longer depression and marriage trouble. \n\nPlan A: husband goes back to work now as a cook and LO goes to daycare. My university has a daycare which is suppose to be really good. It would cost 50% of my husband’s monthly paycheck. LO would have to commute with me (2 hours one way). We continue to live with my uncle but we’d have a little more spending money. \n\nPlan B: husband holds out until LO is 2 and starts working with his friend making roughly 40,000 a year. LO goes to a cheaper and closer daycare since my husband hours would be more stable. We move out and start life on our own. \n\nPlan C: same as plan B except we stay with my uncle and take over at least 50% of the bills. Of course, we’d take the master bedroom from him (uncles already agreed to this). This would leave uncle on call for LO at night and first time in the morning just because how the bedrooms are placed. ",

  "selftext": "Check my previous posts for how I\u0027ve arrived at this situation. Here\u0027s a brief recap:\n\n* Found out my best friend from childhood\u0027s son (21M) was preying on and grooming my daughter (14F)\n* Began a police investigation that unearthed even more details about their relationship (did not discuss this in previous posts because I was too disturbed to process it at the time, but he would often discuss sex and sex acts with her, ask her to send naked pictures/videos of her masturbating, etc.)\n* My best friend accused me of destroying her family because I called the cops on him\n\nI wish she would continue to take this out on me and blame me for everything that has happened. Instead she has began going on a full rampage against my 14 year old daughter, telling all our mutual friends in our town that my daughter is a slut and purposefully tried to ruin her son\u0027s life. She has been making up nasty rumors about how my daughter apparently would \"throw herself\" at her son despite him trying to ignore her and made up some other stuff about how my daughter lied about everything and how she has sex with multiple men (my daughter is a virgin and not sexually active). I\u0027m honestly too heart broken for my daughter right now to write it all out.  My daughter has a very active social circle but many of her friends have obviously heard these rumors from their parents and have stopped talking to her or also engage in the bullying and name calling. I\u0027m attaching an image of one of the texts her friends sent her just now... [https://imgur.com/a/u8c9vuF](https://imgur.com/a/u8c9vuF) I think my \"best friend\" and her family are doing all of this to \"help\" themselves in their police investigation but I don\u0027t really care for the reasons. It\u0027s so awful and I don\u0027t know what to do...\n\nI\u0027ve gotten her a therapist but I wish it didn\u0027t come to this. It\u0027s hard not to blame myself. Some advice/support would be nice because this has been a hell of a week and the only reason I\u0027m still holding it all together is because I know it must be even worse for my baby girl.\n\n**UPDATE**: Thank you for all the responses. My husband and I were talking and we realized that with his job he has the option to relocate to another area. My job does not have a location there however so I would have to find a new one. But the more we talk about it, the more appealing packing up our bags and moving to a new place sounds. I would just have to find a new job there, and I\u0027m not entirely sure how it would affect our case.\n\nBut honestly moving my daughter to a new place and giving her a fresh start sounds amazing. She can start high school there in September and since high school is a new start for most kids, I think it would be the perfect time for her to join so she has an easier time making friends.",

  "title": "Dealing with friends growing up before we are ready (F,11 vs classmates)?",
  "selftext": "Hi all. I don’t even know where to begin to type this all out. About us- I’m a 32 year old single mother of an 11 year old (12 in August) daughter. I am heavily tattooed, I have blue in my hair, I live playing with make up, I am a fine artist. I work in an office job where we get by. We have a good life. We live together with a plethora of animals in a cute, small college town. We both love folky- Americana- rock and roll and both attend concerts to our favorite hands (Frank Turner in October!!!) I don’t believe is hiding a lot from her. I talk to her about life, growing up, the world, dating, and anything happening. She sees her father every other weekend, more if possible. He’s a great father to her, has married and has other children. My daughter is vegetarian by choice. We’ve raised a sweet, compassionate little lady who is nothing more than a kid. She is almost 12, going into middle school next school year, and her only concerns are her bearded dragon, Jake, good old fashioned imaginative play, riding scooters, swimming, coloring with chalk in the drive way, etc. Being an honest to goodness kid. If it were up to her, she\u0027s never brush her hair or care about her appearance. She has started developing breasts and couldn\u0027t care less. I\u0027ll admit she has a bit of a lazy streak to her and if given the chance, she will lay on the couch all day long, and is NOT interested in sports in any way. She\u0027s more academic. \nI’ve noticed all her friends are, well, growing up. They have all started styling their hair, want to play around with make up, spend time on their appearance, post selfies on Instagram, talking about boys and more teenager\" things.  Heck, one of them identities as a member of the LGBTQ community, and my child still thinks boys have cooties (I mean, she isn’t wrong...). My daughter seems to not have anything in common with them anymore. They’re more concerned with checking social media (and my daughter has Instagram, with strict rules and we follow each other, but all she posts is memes and pixel art), and my daughter just wants to play. \nI guess what my concern would be if my daughter is staying a \"kid\" too long, if other kids are growing up too fast, or if I’m overthinking everything. \nI just remember only being concerned with rollerblading and playing with toys at that age myself. It’s such a different world and I guess I am having a bit of trouble navigating it, or even describing how I am feeling. I hole that makes any sense at all. I just want her to be happy and healthy and have a ton of friends and have a wonderful life. I just don\u0027t want her to get \"left behind\" if that would be a good way to put it. I love who she is, and this is all new to us. How do we deal with a world that is growing up faster than we are ready? I really hope this doesn\u0027t come off wrong. I don\u0027t think there is anything wrong here per se. I\u0027d just love to see if any other parents have noticed anything similar. \n",

  "title": "WHY IS YOUR CHILD ANGRY AND WHAT CAN YOU DO TO HELP?",
  "selftext": "It is increasingly becoming common to hear from [parents ](https://hiveparenting.com/articles/why-is-your-child-angry-and-what-can-you-do-to-help)that their children are being **“aggressive”, “destructive” or “rageful”**. Parents often report that the more they try to control the child and stop him from getting angry, the angrier the child gets.  \n\n\nAnger in its most primitive form is felt when one feels invaded or abandoned. It is also a reaction to something or someone of value being taken away, feeling misunderstood or wronged, or one’s needs being ignored. This angry response is natural, healthy, and a part of the human survival instinct.  \n\n\nThe purpose of this spontaneous anger is to let one know when someone is invading their boundaries in some inappropriate way or ignoring their needs. It helps one to set appropriate limits or to get the environment to respond. As parents it is important for us to understand that anger is a healthy expression.   \n\n\n**Here are a few ways in which a parent could respond to the child’s anger:**\n\n## ONE\n\nCreating a space for anger does not mean that the parent always agrees to the child. When a child disagrees, appropriate parenting responses involve giving reasons for rules, listening, honoring the child\u0027s objections, changing rules if appropriate, and staying firm with the limits as set.\n\n## TWO\n\nTeaching children that the best way to handle injustice is through assertion rather than aggression.   \nA child could express his/ anger assertively,   \n**for example, saying “I am angry with you because you are ignoring me.”**  \nParents could also encourage the child to express his/ her needs directly,   \n**for example, “I would like you to pay more attention to me.\"**\n\n## THREE\n\nModeling or showing to children through parent\u0027s actions that we can deliver our requests or disagreements calmly and respectfully.  \nAlso, children learn cooperation when parents cooperate with them.\n\n## FOUR\n\nHelping the child to identify and be aware of his/her anger.\n\n## FIVE\n\nDialoguing with the child to identify what he/she is angry about.\n\n## SIX\n\nEncouraging the child to think through and consider what options are available for solving the problem.   \nThe child can then choose one of the options and implement it.\n\nWhen the child feels free to express his anger in the here-and-now and is supported through the process, the expressions of anger are healthy and at the appropriate moment, rather than being suppressed and taking other forms like aggression, frustration, rage or withdrawal.   \n\n\nThrough this, children learn to be authentic, to get their needs met directly, to stand up for themselves and consequently to protect themselves.",

How can society view this as OK?\n\nI\u0027m not talking about childfree people.

I don\u0027t want to turn this into an abortion debate and won\u0027t respond to posts about abortion since everyone is allowed their own opinion on that.\n\nCan we think for a moment about what this girl really needed? She needed an adult in her life to give her good advice. Scaring her about her bf getting jail time is more likely to make her respond like a teenager and focus on protecting him instead of getting help.\n\nTelling her to get an abortion doesn\u0027t get a concerned adult in her life which is what she needs. She said she would feel like she is killing her own child, which anyone can look up development and know there is a heartbeat by 8 weeks. You are not this girls parent and shouldn\u0027t counsel her on a life changing decision that you\u0027re in no way involved in. What if she gets an abortion and falls into the category of kids who become suicidal? This is something that happens and while you may have had an abortion without regret it doesn\u0027t mean that is true for everyone. I won\u0027t respond to posts about abortion.\n\nI think the best thing for this girl is to find a compassionate adult who can help her talk to her parents and get her proper help on all levels. I didn\u0027t read all the posts but I know from people who work with pregnant teens that most parents will initially be angry and then get over it. The teen would greatly benefit finding an org that works with pregnant teens, who can answer her questions, help her make a plan, tell her how to talk to her parents, and give her emotional support whatever the outcome.\n\nThis girl needs her parents more involved in her life. Even if you\u0027re the kind of parent who thinks the best approach to teen sex is giving your teen a condom I would hope you\u0027d want your kid getting advice from people who are invested in the outcome not people who will likely never hear from the child again.\n\nI really hope she finds an adult she can trust to talk this through with so she can deal with her fears and be counseled on making good decisions.",

We know this is completely natural and none of the searches have been alarming, but the latest time we caught her looking up something on her grandmothers iPad after being alone with it for only a few minutes.\n\nWhile we aren\u0027t worried about her being curious at all we are worried about her getting very wrong impressions about sex, boys and girl\u0027s bodies at such an impressionable age.  We have had disconnect her computer from the internet and now she is not allowed to have an ipad or phone outside of eyesight of us until we feel we can trust her again.\n\nAny recommendations on how we should talk to her, books for us to read together, videos to watch, anything to help her curiosity?   The only book we have used so far is Care and Keeping of You which is good for puberty stuff but not so much for this. \n\nWe do try and talk with her but she gets extremely embarrassed, usually hides under covers, etc.  To give you a little background, she does have some learning disabilities, definitely dyslexia but perhaps some others as well, where it is very difficult for her to put into words what her brain is currently thinking or feeling.  Many serious discussions with her she quickly fixates on emotions or issues she had several months ago because those she has come to understand over time.  Its very hard to discuss what she is feeling or going through in the present.\n\nLittle at a loss here on best way to move forward, don\u0027t want to squash her curiosity but want her to have a healthy outlook on sex and her body image.

  "title": "14 year old pierced her ears and has been hoarding make up, against my wishes.",
  "selftext": "\nReddit, I’m at a loss and I have no idea what to do next, I need advice. \n\nI’m a fairly seasoned mother of 4 (14f, 12m, 9f and 5m). My daughter is 14 years old and is just going into her freshman year of high school at the end of the summer. I’ve always tried to be open with her, and leave room for discussion in our household but this is not a free for all, and I’ve been very clear on the hard lines I draw with all of my children in my household. I consider myself a fairly conservative woman, but I don’t think I go overboard or am too much of a “hover mom”. My kids are allowed to watch various ratings of movies (as long as is viewed the movie first or am present), I allow them to have sleepovers on weekends and they’re free to roam the neighborhood with their friends during the summer as long as they check in every couple hours. \n\nI feel like I’m a fairly reasonable parent, and have reasonable expectations. Simple things like keep your grades up, help out around the house, and maintain at least one activity during the school year. One things I’ve always tried to drive home with both my daughters is that you’re much more than your looks. I always had garbage self esteem growing up and grew up with what I would say was an overly critical mother. I don’t have any contact with her, and she’s only ever met my oldest daughter a handful of times before I decided ending the relationship would be best for me. I understand appearances can be important in “the real world” as far as careers go, and making sure oneself is presentable, but I’ve never encouraged anything more than good hygiene and grooming with my children. I’ve actively discouraged the use of beauty products, and overly flashy clothing. \n\nI myself avoid buying make up, body shapewear, gimmicky “lose weight and eat what you want!” Products and I’ve especially discourage body modifications. I’ve tried to set a good example for my girls, and working on my self esteem to make sure I can instill a good self worth in them, and I’ve been very clear that what’s inside them is what really counts, and have been very mindful of encouraging them and praising them for who they are. They’re lovely young women. Smart, artistic and kind hearted. \n\nThis is where my issue with my oldest comes into play. I have made it very clear that until she is of age and out of our family home, she is not to wear make up, her clothes must be modest in appearance and she’s not to be putting any unnecessary holes in herself, dying her hair ridiculous colors or otherwise undermining her natural beauty. My daughter came home from a two day long sleepover at her best friends house a couple days ago, which I usually would never think twice about. After she was dropped off she seemed more withdrawn than usual, didn’t really feel like talking about her weekend and asked to skip dinner as she wasn’t feeling well. It was definitely unusual and I was concerned, but I let her go to bed and decided to wrap up her plate and see how she was feeling in the morning. \n\nI usually let my children sleep in a bit but after 10am, I’ll generally wake them up. My daughter was still in bed at 10:30 so I went into her room to wake her when I noticed she had pierced her ears! I hadn’t noticed the night before, I’m guessing that’s why she was so quick to her room and she had her hair down over her ears. I was absolutely *furious* and began shouting at her, asking what she’d done (I’ll admit I probably could’ve handled the situation a bit better) and immediately demanded to know when and where she got her ears pierced. I couldn’t imagine a reputable piercing establishment would pierce a CHILD without parental permission! My daughter informed me that her best friends mother took them to some piercing kiosk in the mall and paid to have her ears pierced. On a whim! I can’t even imagine what would possess another parent to put a hole in someone else’s child without even so much as consulting me, and my daughter *definitely* knows better. \n\nI’ve been careful to leave zero room for confusion about my expectations for my children. I told my daughter to go downstairs and show her father what she’d done to herself while I tried to calm down a bit and contact her best friends mother.  I haven’t gotten an answer and have left several messages on her cell but I can only imagine she’s avoiding me, and rightfully so. I took it upon myself to search my daughters room. Normally this isn’t something I do, but after such a gross display of disrespect and defiance, it’s my right as a parent to examine what else my child could be hiding. I found a ziplock bag wrapped in a sweater in the back of her closet, which was absolutely full of make up. I can only assume she used MY money (my children each get an age appropriate allowance for extra chores they do during the week) or she stole it. I went downstairs with the bag and asked her about it, and she admitted that she’d been buying herself different make up products and had gotten some hand me downs from her best friend, which is disgusting in my opinion. I told her she needed to remove the earrings put some alcohol on the holes, hand me her phone and wait upstairs until I was ready to deal with her. I ended up tossing the make up in the garbage, and taking it outside. \n\nMy husband and I both went through her phone together and found some questionable texts between her and a boy who lives in another state. Definitely flirtatious and crossing some boundaries, but thankfully no explicit pictures sent from either of them. I have taken her phone and removed all make up items indefinitely and have reduced her wardrobe to very simplistic outfits for the time being. She is no longer allowed to have sleepovers at her best friends house, only at our with my supervision, and has been placed on punishment for the rest of her summer. I’m considering filing a police report against her bffs mother, because I find it appalling that another adult would lack such basic parental judgment, and pierce my daughter without my consent. \n\nI’m just so..disappointed? I’m angry of course but I feel so disrespected. I like to think I have a good relationship with all my children, but I will never accept disrespect and disobedience. We work hard to provide and I will not have my children walk all over me like some parents. That’s just not me. My daughter knows exactly what is expected of her and what allowed in this household and she has been willfully dishonest and has shown she has zero respect for my authority as her mother, for god knows how long. My husband has been taking this with a much more lax approach which has definitely been putting a strain on our interactions since this whole ordeal started. He thinks I should let it slide and that ear piercings are normal and that wanting to wear make up isn’t an issue. I disagree, all piercings can be seen as “normal” depending on who you ask, but our daughter knew how I felt about it and went behind my back and had another adult foot the bill without ever discussing it with me. She knows that she’s beautiful just the way she is, and she knows how I feel about her wearing make up. She’s been sneaking and hiding make up and god knows what else for months at the very least and has shown zero remorse since I’ve found out. She hasn’t even spoke to me since Monday night. I’m afraid of the influence she’s going to have on her younger sister, and I’m worried that she thinks so little of herself that she needs to wear make up and put holes in her body to feel beautiful for these little shits on the internet who just want to use her. Reddit, I’m lost. I don’t know what to do, I’m feel so disappointed and betrayed, and I hate that she won’t speak to me. My husband is making me feel so alone and isn’t doing much to validate my feelings or even back be up as a coparent. What is the appropriate way of dealing with this and what is a reasonable consequence? I’m sort of winging it at this point, as this is the first time my daughter has ever pulled something even remotely this unacceptable. Am I just a crazy tyrant or would you also feel incredibly disrespected? What should my next steps be? ",

  "title": "In a tough situation with my daughter\u0027s new friend.",
  "selftext": "This is kind of a weird situation I have never found myself in before, and I am not sure how I should feel about this...\n\nI am white, upper middle class, and have a nice home which I work very hard for and work from home as well. I have a 7 year old daughter, who is very friendly and makes friends with everyone. As such we have random neighborhood kids in our yard from time to time. So one day I notice a new little boy and girl from the apartment complex down the block from us.\n\nI go and introduce myself, and start chatting these kids up, and they were pleasant, friendly, and generally well behaved children. They are Mexican. My town has been getting a lot of California refugees, and I am in real estate, so naturally, I want to know where they came from, and what their story is, as I do with all of my daughters\u0027 friends. So I start poking and prodding, and the little boy  consistently repeats \"That is an ok question to ask.\" before answering my question, making it seem as if he had been coached on what to say to people who asked him specific questions.\n\nIn my convos with the kids, I got the idea that they escaped some gang ridden wasteland in the California desert. Lately, we have had a stupid looking low-riding pickup truck driving around watching our house, and these kids. I can see the idiots driving this vehicle, because they are blasting some sort of non-music and being very conspicuous in my neighborhood. Even my wife commented on this, and made eye contact with one of the passengers in the vehicle. They are obviously looking at our house, while these new children are playing in our yard...\n\nAnyway, time goes by, and the little boy, eventually has an outburst, and destroys one of my daughter\u0027s favorite toys, and I\u0027m like ok, whatever... But when I ask him about it, he just lies to my face (I have security footage, and cameras are important in my hood) about it, blatantly. After informing this kid (he\u0027s about 8) I watch everyone in this neighborhood, and I watched him do it, he became ashamed and hasn\u0027t been back since. My daughter has no problem with him never coming over again, as she was a little frightened of him during his outburst.\n\nMeanwhile, the mom is very standoffish, unfriendly, and it seems that they live with their grandfather who doesn\u0027t seem to do much in the way of raising these kids. They basically fend for themselves all day long, riding their bikes in a circle around my house waiting to play with my daughter whenever they can. I come to find out that she works 2 jobs, and never sees her kids much. I felt really bad for her, as I work from home, and m always home to play with my children.\n\nSo more and more, I am ending up watching this little girl, feeding her, catering to her needs, when her grandfather is in an apartment down the block doing who knows what. I send her home whenever we need to do family things like eat dinner or watch a movie, but she has basically attached herself to my family at this point. She came to our house in tears today, frantically explaining that no one was home today, and she doesn\u0027t know what to do. I didn\u0027t know what to do either, and so we just let her stay with us until her mom came to pick her up today HOURS LATER, like she expected her to be with us and for us to watch her while she was probably working.\n\nSo once she comes to pick her up, we finally got to chat with her, forcefully, as we are trying to figure out what the hell is going on with this new family. She spoke perfect English, and seemed as if she was born in the US, and told us about how she works all day and her dad (the granddad) is raising her kids, blah blah. Nothing we didn\u0027t know already... Then out of nowhere, she mentions that her husband is getting out of jail in California and is moving into the apartment in less than a month. \n\nSo now, I\u0027m just worried. WTF do I do in this situation? I feel as if it would be naive and foolish to just ignore it, hope that this felon wasn\u0027t a violent sex offender or something, and just let our kids play together happily ever after. That sounds like it would easily turn into an episode of Forensic Files, and what an idealogically filled teenager would do. I am leaning on more towards getting our local drug task force involved in the situation, as it is quite possible he will not be legally allowed to leave the state. I think drugs are the most probable reason, so that is why I feel as if that specific enforcement agency is most relevant.\n\nHow do I approach (or should I approach) this felon, fresh out of prison from a different culture and socio-economic status? Should I ask him outright what he did to end up in jail? What would you do in this situation? I should note that our home is also our place of business, which has a lot of sensitive information about clients, has a lot of electronics, and valuable items. \n\nI would be paranoid about this dude if he was white, so don\u0027t get all \"you\u0027re a racist\" on me, because that is not the case. I have no idea what this guy did to end up in jail, but for the amount of time he was in jail, he could have been put away for theft, larceny, maybe low level sex offense, robbery, assault, and stuff like that (around 2-4 years in prison).\n\nTL:DR - Daughter\u0027s friend\u0027s dad is a felon getting out of jail shortly, and moving across state lines basically next door to me and I am unsure how to feel about this.",

  "title": "Single Father clueless about how to guide my daughter during her transition into womanhood.",
  "selftext": "I am a single father with one 12(13 in October) year old daughter. Honestly I never wanted to be a father. However one of my girlfriends got pregnant after accidentally taking antibiotics when she was on the pill which caused it not to work. I told her I would support her no matter what and she decided to keep it. Soon after we had our beautiful baby girl Astrid. I immediately fell in love. Before her I was in kind of a spiral of self destruction. Alcoholism, drug addiction, depression. I kind of hated my self. I thought I was a worthless piece of shit who would be better of dead. But when I first held Astrid I was filled with purpose. And I vowed to love and protect her for the rest of my life. \n\nHer mom and I raised her together for the first year and a half, and we were a great team. I was planning to pop the question but before I could she passed away after getting T Boned at an intersection. It was tragic and really sent me into a tailspin. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t think I could raise a child all by myself, but every time I looked in Astrids eyes I knew that I would do anything for her. And so I decided that I would do my best. I figured that as long as I showed her love, support, and kindness I couldn’t screw it up... right?\n\nThe past 12 years have been the best of my life. I’ve got to see this little girl blossom into her own person and form her own ideas and beliefs. She is so smart. Too smart for her own good honestly. She reminds me a lot of myself at her age. Always getting in trouble at school for being sarcastic or uppity(as one of her teachers put it). I know exactly what she’s going through because I went through the same thing so I’ve been able to help her get through it. Teach her about the value of respect, honesty, but most importantly standing up for her ideals and never letting anyone get her down. She’s so independent and I couldn’t be prouder. We even have a book club where we read very difficult books and she has no problem understanding them. We just finished infinite jest and she understood it better than I did when I first read it, at 20...\n\nAnyways, enough bragging. The point is that I think I’ve been doing a great job with raising her. But something recently happened and I feel like a failure as a father. She had her first period when she was at a club she goes to. She wasn’t prepared and I had to come and pick her up. On the ride home she was in tears and wouldn’t talk to me. She is always such a stoic(odd word choice but it’s true) and rational girl who doesn’t cry much. This is the first time I’ve seen her cry in a long time. I basically told her that I am here for her whenever she feels like talking, and that I love and support her. She spent the night laying in bed. I decided to let her come to me when she was ready(still not sure if that’s the right choice).\n\nI’ve always told her that I’d answer any questions she had about mostly anything. I’ve talked with her about sex, puberty, drugs, etc. I’ve been incredibly honest with her and have done my best to not lie or act uncomfortable. I remember being her age and my parents were not open with me about that stuff and it sucked, so I vowed to be different. I’ve discussed puberty and getting periods with her, but honestly I wasn’t expecting it to happen so soon(naive I know). I guess just subconsciously I pushed it off because I was afraid of her growing up. It’s irrational I know but I just love this girl so much. \n\nEventually she decides to talk with me. I discuss getting your period and what that means, and tried to go about it from a positive angle. Telling her it’s a good thing because it means she is becoming a woman. She then tells me that people in her club are making fun of her because of it, and that it happened right in front of everyone. I try and tell her to not listen to them and just push it off, but inside I know how hard that can be. I honestly couldn’t think of anything I could do or tell her that would make this better, being bullied sucks. And me fighting her battles for her might make things worse. I just don’t know what to do. \n\nIn order to be prepared I take her to the pharmacy and we buy some pads. I didn’t know if tampons are a good choice for beginners so I figured pads would be better but I bought some tampons just Incase. We get back to the apartment and I’m trying to help her through the bathroom door but then realize I have no idea what the hell I’m doing. Later that day I’m talking with my friend Monica about the whole situation and she offers to come over and talk with Astrid about everything. Monica and Astrid are very close so I thought it was a good idea. \n\nThe next day we all sit down together and Monica starts speaking with Astrid about everything that’s happening with her body. And I just side on the sidelines like a complete dope, nodding my head like I already knew all this while in reality it was completely new to me. I knew the basics(or so I thought), but I had no idea about all the other intricate details. Monica shows her how to use pads and tampons, how to help with cramps, and pretty much everything else she would need to know. Honestly she was a lifesaver, I would’ve been completely clueless to have the stuff they were talking about. \n\nBasically after all of this I just feel like kind of a failure. I couldn’t help my daughter navigate this situation and I’m completely ignorant to the nuances. I didn’t even know how pads or tampons work. How am I supposed to raise a daughter when I have no idea what she’s going through? I’m just stressed out. All I can do is offer love and support. But sometimes that’s not enough. \n\nI’m sorry for the long ass post. I’m just worried and a little down on myself. Astrid and I have an amazing and close relationship where we are completely honest and open with one another so I just want to be there to help her. But I’m not sure if I can. \n\n\nTLDR: Daughter had her first period, Man Dad realizes he knows much less about female anatomy than he thought. ",

  "title": "Balancing respecting authority and challenging authority with kids?",
  "selftext": "How do you teach your kids to both respect and challenge authority?\n\nWe don\u0027t want our kids to blindly follow authority. I think there are some times where authority needs to be challenged and the person \"in charge\" doesn\u0027t necessarily know what\u0027s best. We also need to teach our kids to respect authority, at least to some degree. Following the directions of a police officer, for example, can be the difference between life and death. There are other smaller scale instances where challenging authority isn\u0027t the best move. My kids play sports and I can think of a few times my son didn\u0027t agree with the coaches call but speaking up in the middle of a game would have gotten him benched. Not following the rules or guidelines at school or sports can get you into some deep water. The same thing goes for their future career. \n\nSo, how do you balance it? How to you teach them to not blindly follow whoever is in charge EXCEPT for those times they need to blindly follow whoever is in charge? My oldest is 11 and is pretty good about differentiating when it is and isn\u0027t appropriate. He doesn\u0027t give into peer pressure and is a leader, but I have also unfortunately noticed that he\u0027s not really the type to take much action. For example, last year the middle school my husband teaches at did a walk out and he was talking about it at dinner. My son said that he agreed with the walk out but wouldn\u0027t do it if his teacher told him not to. That kind of thing worried me. \n\nMy 5 year old is more intense and doesn\u0027t have that sense of respecting authority. I have a toddler son as well and I want to make sure I get this right. I don\u0027t want to get a call that my kid is dead because they didn\u0027t follow a police officers instructions or have them get suspended in high school for disobeying school rules but I also don\u0027t want to teach them that they should blindly follow authority.

  "title": "How can I convince my mom that she is being controlling and not allowing me to grow as a young adult?",
  "selftext": "I am not sure if children are really supposed to post on this sub, but I figured people with children would have good insight on how they would want their child to go about this. \n\nBasically, I am a 19 year old female who started college last fall. I went out of state for college at a school I worked really hard to get into on what was almost a full ride. When I was there I made a ton of really great friends and loved it until I got raped. I also acquired a stalker. The stress from these two separate situations gave me extreme depression and anxiety. To cope with this I drank and eventually developed a drinking problem.\n\nWhen I told my mom about the sexual assault she drove 4+ hours to my school without my permission and stayed at the campus hotel for a week. While there, she basically controlled my life and set up appointments with many staff members at the school and made my situation 10x worse. At the end of her stay she made up a lie about my grandfather being sick and told me she would take me to see him just to get me to come home. Once I was home she refused to take me back. Luckily my dad and her are divorcing so he drove me back a couple days later. \n\nWhen I told her how someone had sex with me while I was blacked out (a different guy) she came to my school again even though she promised she wouldn’t react that way anymore. \n\nWhen I came home for winter break she was driving me back and once we got to the campus she changed her mind and started driving me home even though I was yelling for her to take me back. My dad threatened to call the cops on her and she finally drove me back. \n\nI ended up leaving school on my own in March to get help with my drinking problem. I’ve been meeting with a substance abuse councilor since returning home and started a recovery program two months ago. I’ve been sober for about 70 days now and have dedicated all of my time to getting well. I handled all of my legal problems with my drinking at school and done the responsible thing and think I have proven that I can make good decisions. \n\nNow, with school around the corner, I have to make the decision to go back or stay home a year to get my GPA up to transfer. My mom refuses to support my decision to go back and will not pay nor drive me to school. My dad is supporting me, but is out of the country so I need my mom to drive me. She told me we will not have a relationship if I go back and she will completely cut me off financially. \n\nAll of the professionals that have worked with me closely think I am ready to go back and I have even agreed to go to an out patient recovery program while I’m at school. The professionals say my mother is being very controlling and that I need to cut her out of my life, at least for now. If I stay I will be depressed because all of my friends from home go away for school and I would have to live with my mom who has an extreme amount of anxiety, as well as OCD. \n\nEven if I stay our relationship will be so strained because I will resent her from taking away what I feel is my first real adult decision. I sympathize with her and know she is doing this because she cares, but she has to realize I’m an adult and have to make my own choices. \n\nHow can I convince her that what she is doing is hurting me and stunting my growth? Also, do you think I need to cut her out of my life? \n\n\n\n",

  "selftext": "My children and I were visiting an indoor play place, and a kid was throwing balls at other kid\u0027s faces, and not in a playful way.  I looked at him and said, \"Hey!

I explained what her child was doing, but she was still angry that I addressed him about it, rather than addressing her about it.\n\nI later told some friends the story, and they suggested that next time I use \"teacher language,\" like \"Excuse me, sweetie, but I don\u0027t think that little girl likes being whacked in the face with balls.

  "title": "My 13 year old daughter is pregnant and I want to throw up",
  "selftext": "I’ve never been so distraught in my entire life, and I feel like an abysmal failure of a mother. What parent allows their 13 year old child to even be seriously dating, let alone having sex? How did it even happen? I’ve always prided myself on staying vigilant and present in my daughters life, and have done my best to keep an open dialogue. My daughter has had several “boyfriends” but never anything serious or more than inviting them to family movie nights, ordering pizza and playing video games or maybe dropping them off at the mall for a few hours. I’ve done my best to make sure she has the proper supervision, without being overly restrictive or helicoptering. We’ve talked about sex many time and I’ve been clear that it is a normal thing to do, but within the confines of a safe, healthy relationship when you’re emotionally mature enough to handle all the intimate complexities and consequences that come with sharing your body with someone. I’ve personally only ever been with my husband, and while I didn’t expect her to wait until marriage, I did expect her not to just give it up to the first boy that asked. \n\nShe came to me a few weeks ago and told me she’d had her first kiss at her schools end of year field day. I was happy she felt that she could trust me and told her I was happy for her, but I did let her know that I felt that while peck kissing was perfectly fine, anything more than that at this age is definitely inappropriate. I wouldn’t say I’m a prude, but I don’t believe 13 year olds should be exploring past 1st base at this point in the emotional development. She assured me that she wasn’t comfortable going any farther than kissing and that she only did it because she was the last of her friends to have their first kiss. Admittedly I should’ve seen that as more of a red flag, but I remembered being 13 and know that peer pressure can be intense. I made sure to tell her that she should never do anything she’s not comfortable with just because other people might be ready before her. \n\nI noticed my daughter seemed much more withdrawn and irritable lately, and I was starting to worry but also figured hey, she’s 13, it’s rough. I opted to give her some space and not really force her to talk to me about it just yet. I assumed her and her best friend were in a fight, since she hadn’t been coming by lately. After a couple days of her locking herself in her room, not eating, and hearing her cry in the bathroom several times a day, her father and I decided to sit her down this morning and ask her what exactly was wrong. She just sat at our table in silence with a blank expression on her face, and wouldn’t even look at us. I asked if she was having problems with her best friend, if we’d done something that’d upset her or if something was going on online that I needed to know about. Nothing. No expression, not even one worded answers. I was starting to get a very bad feeling in my gut and asked to see her phone. She *flipped her sh!t*. My daughter has never even so much as breathed wrong in her father and I’s direction, with the exception of some very normal/mild preteen and teen attitude, so I was very caught off guard. She began screaming at us to leave her alone, to “mind our f***ing business”, that we “don’t need to know sh!t” and to F off. She got up from the table and tried to walk out our front door and my husband grabbed her and just tried to bear hug her until she calmed down. I’d never seen her so explosive and distraught and to be honest it scared the hell out of me. I actually though she’d had a nervous break down. \n\nAfter awhile, she calmed down. We took her phone, she tried to snatch it away from us one last time but I took her by the arm with me upstairs and sat her down in my bedroom. That’s when the tears just came. She was absolutely inconsolable. I couldn’t understand a word she was saying and she began hyperventilating. At this point I started crying too, just out of pure fear and confusion. My daughter has always been a very happy, excitable girl with bare minimum behavior issues. She’s always smiling and hanging out with her friends, making everyone laugh. This was a side of my daughter I didn’t recognize. \n\nThat’s when she dropped the bomb on me, she’s pregnant. I felt so sick I was dizzy. I didn’t know what else to do so I just hugged her and cried with her. My husband found us upstairs and looked bewildered, so I pulled him into the hallway and told him. He just walked off. Just got in his truck and drove away. He’s been gone since noon and keeps forwarding my calls to voicemail. I feel so scared for my daughter and overwhelmed, and I hate that he just up and left me with this all by myself. I took my daughter to our local health department this afternoon and had them do a test to be sure. She’s definitely pregnant. My 13 year old child is pregnant and life doesn’t even seem real anymore. She’s being sent in for a dating scan next week, but from the day of her last period, she could be nearing 10 weeks along. She just started her period at the beginning of the school year, and she hasn’t been regular. The girl doesn’t even know how to use a tampon and she’s pregnant. How could we have failed her this badly? How does this even happen? I’m just..defeated? I don’t even know what I am to be honest. I can’t find the proper words to express this feeling. \n\nAfter some discussion, I’ve discovered that the father is a 16 year old neighbor kid that I’ve literally only met twice? Maybe 3 times? He does lawn care in our neighborhood during the summers and I’ve had him mow our lawn once. I didn’t even know they knew each other, let alone had been having sex. How did I not know? She told me that under no circumstances will she get an abortion. She told me she won’t kill her baby and that if I try to make her, she’ll just disappear. I would never ask her to do something like that and I certainly wouldn’t force her, but she won’t even hear what I have to say about adoption and she’s made it clear she wants to raise this baby. Any time I’ve brought up adoption or talking to someone at the pregnancy crisis center, she shuts down and stops talking to me. I asked her if she’d told the father, she said that she told him on Tuesday, and that he offered to take her to the clinic for an abortion and when she said she planned on raising the baby, he blocked her number. She said she tried walking down to his house but no one would open the door. \n\nI’m sick, furious, confused and so so scared. What the actual f**k do I do? What even is the next step in this situation? My daughter is barely an 8th grader and she wants to have a baby? I’ve stressed over and over how unbelievably hard her life is going to be. I’ve explained to her that she’ll likely have no choice but to homeschool, she’ll likely have a hard time finding a job and never be able to go to a university. She’s going to live in poverty and be a single mother. I’ve tried telling her that she deserves so much more from her life and that a baby deserves a mother who can provide for it properly, and that she have her whole life to become a mother. What 13 year old wants to have a baby?! I’ve tried to explain the gravity of the situation and the seriousness that is raising a life, but I just don’t think she’s hearing me. We really can’t afford to raise another baby but I don’t know what other choice we have. \n\nI know this is long, but the last 10 hours of my life has been like a dream. I have no idea where my husband is, my barely not baby is having a baby, we can’t afford another child and I don’t think my marriage would survive something like this. It’s been sort of cathartic to get this out there, since I don’t really have anyone to tell right and and honestly, I don’t think I even want to. Reddit, what do I do? Because I just want to lay down in a hole and cry right now. I really just need some direction and support right now because I’m at a completely loss. \n\n",

  "selftext": "Long story short:\nMy husband and I (26 \u0026 25 respectively) are assuming the care of my husbands 16yo sister. \nTheir father is out of the picture- he was abusive to their mother as my husband was growing up, and their mother left him. He was also unfaithful and now has a whole ‘replacement’ family. He had custody of my husband’s sister after their mom escaped her situation up until about 2 years ago. \nTheir mother is literally at her wits end. Once she left, she spent years fighting to get custody of my husbands sister, legally. She received full custody roughly two years ago. Everything was okay for the first couple of months, but it’s come to a point now where all my husband’s mother and sister are doing is fighting. His sister just turned 16. She’s ‘admitted’ (term used loosely because she uses situations as ammunition and changes the story often) that she has been having sex, using drugs, drinking, etc. She has a “boyfriend” whom she has been caught with several times with home alone, or sneaking out to be with. (She’s no longer allowed to stay home alone). It seems as if there is always some type of drama. She is in counseling, and I’m not sure of the specifics of it currently, but I know that their mom doesn’t think it’s doing any good. Their mom has a new relationship (several months long at this point), and they had been talking about moving in together for a while now. Mom and sister fight 90-ish% of the time and yesterday their mom called my husband, upset, and said she couldn’t handle it anymore. My husband offered to take his sister in, which I am 100% okay with doing, other than not being sure what either of us are going to do to help this situation. His sister does work and will be going back to high school (new school since she’ll be living with us). The agreement they made was that she would be staying here, but since she’s working, she has to develop a budget and assist with paying bills and create a savings account (as she does not have a car or her license or future plans for that matter). I know, technically, legally, that their mom should be handling this, but I don’t think she has the resources to do so either, or maybe she’s just not willing to? I’m not sure, but Neither my husband or I are willing to give up on her. I think that is most of the important info. \n\nPlease advise.\nSend resources. \nSend the Calvary. \nSend anything remotely helpful. \n\nWe don’t have any kids of our own. I have a younger sibling, but there is not as large a gap between us and the whole situation is just out of my experience range. \n",

  "title": "So burnt out. So tired of struggling.",
  "selftext": "I mostly lurk on this forum but I just need to vent. I don\u0027t have anyone else I can talk to irl. So you guys are gonna be my therapist for today.\n\nI knew becoming a mom would be hard. My child\u0027s father left me very early on in my pregnancy and I thought I was prepared to handle single momming on my own. I moved back in with my mom and my disabled sister to help save money. I worked two jobs up until the day I went into labor and went right back to both jobs at six weeks postpartum.\n\nGoddamn it is hard.\n\nI am struggling so much more than I ever have before. I\u0027m the only one who has a car. My mom watches my LO for me so I can work but she guilt trips me at every chance she gets. I suffer from PPD but I\u0027ve yet to actually see somebody about it because my sister has several appointments a week or my mom needs to use my car. I pay the rent, the light bill, the water bill and the internet. I make too much working both jobs to receive any type of help so I have to buy mine and my LO\u0027s food/formula while my mom uses her EBT to buy herself and my sister\u0027s food.\n\nI get 50/month from my child\u0027s sperm donor and had to fight tooth and nail to make him pay his part. He doesn\u0027t acknowledge our child as his. He accused me of trying to trap him when he\u0027s the one who took off the condom while we had sex. He is an ex for a very good reason.\n\nI\u0027m just tired of struggling. Tired of going to work two different jobs on 3-4 hours of sleep. Tired of being away from my baby anywhere between 12-16 hours a day. Tired of my mom feeling entitled to my paychecks to fund her lifestyle.\n\nMy shoes have holes in them, when it rains my feet get soaked and I can\u0027t justify spending money on getting a new pair. I\u0027m in danger of losing both of my jobs because I can\u0027t afford a new pair of shoes for each one because my mom thinks I should fund her lifestyle under the guise of her watching my baby/us living with her.  I know, having a disabled child like my sister sucks ass and is a drain on the finances but it\u0027s also a drain on me and she just doesn\u0027t get it. I work so hard to just end up with nothing to show for it.\n\nI can\u0027t remember the last time I bought any thing nice for myself. I can\u0027t remember the last time I had anything good happen. I\u0027m always paying off some bill for my mom or giving her money because she pulls the \"I don\u0027t have to watch your child for you!\" Card.  A good 75% of both of my paychecks goes to the bills. I only make 7.25 an hour at one job and 2.15 an hour at my 2nd (waitressing sucks and I have to share tips with the other waiters). I struggle so hard just to make ends meet.\n\nI just want the clouds to part and I get a little break. I love my baby and will do anything for her but holy crap. I just want to take a nice bubble bath or get a beer without my mom flipping her shit. I want to go to a movie or eat a meal in peace. I haven\u0027t had any of that since I was 13 weeks along. And it\u0027s not like I can tell my mom to knock it off or else she will kick us out and we have nowhere else to go. I can\u0027t afford 1500-2200 a month in daycare costs.\n\nSorry for the whiney vent but hey, better to get it out than keep it in I guess. I just wish someone had told me how hard it would be.",

I have looked it up and the answers range from 12 to 17. My son said he is fine with me staying and actually wants to me stay. He is pretty mature and independent. My biggest concern would be him not communicating things that I want answers to or the pediatrician not having all his medical information. Do you communicate with the doctor beforehand if there are any questions you have? Do you talk to the doctor after to make sure everything checks out? I\u0027m not worried about anything major but things like when to expect puberty to start for him, making sure he\u0027s growing right, etc. are things I would like to be kept in the loop about.",

  "title": "Thoughts on children watching kissing/slightly intimate romantic scenes in movies",
  "selftext": "Hello, I’m not a parent but this is something I’ve been thinking about a lot recently and i’m interested in hearing some opinions about it. I have a 7 year old cousin (the baby of the family) and I’ve noticed that whenever we’re all watching a movie together her mom and/or our grandparents will freak out whenever a kissing scene comes up and tell her to look away. I even remember my aunt (the 7 yo’s mom) doing this same thing to me when I was around that age. We were watching a movie in theaters and she angrily hissed at me to cover my eyes when a kissing scene came on. \n\n\nI just feel like this is such a dramatic and unnecessary reaction. I’m worried that it’s giving her the impression that there’s something wrong with showing romantic affection and will set her up for shameful feelings about sex in the future. Obviously I understand she shouldn’t be mimicking such behavior at her age but I don’t understand why the adults in the situation don’t just make sure she knows those things are only for adults. I also understand why they don’t want her seeing more intense scenes, such as pg-13 type depictions of sex, but I still feel like they should handle it in a more subtle(mature?? can’t really think of what word I want to use here) way instead of reacting as if it’s the worse possible thing she could see. I also dislike how they react that way to sexually charged scenes but I’ve never seen any objection to her watching scenes full of violence, which is worse in my opinion. \n\n\nHow do you all handle your children seeing pg-13 depictions of romance and intimacy? Do you think my family’s reactions are appropriate? Am I overthinking when I worry about how this will negatively affect her feelings towards intimacy in the future? Thanks in advance for any responses!",

  "title": "A mobile parent - maintaining good contact with our children during separation (by MythicOwl)",
  "selftext": "A lot is happening in the summer. Time spent outside, previously unknown stimuli, adventures in the forest, on the beach, in the grandmother’s garden...During the holidays, the child experiences many events - not only the happy ones. The sun can burn, a wasp can bite, our new buddy may run off with our beloved, our favourite, the one and only green spatula. And during that time you are on a business trip and your only have your telephone with you. You do not understand much from your child\u0027s story except that something is wrong. You want to let him feel that he can count on you in every situation, but how do you do it at a distance? During a time of separation the best ally is the right communication.\n\n\u0026#x200B;\n\n**· Accept their feelings** \\- no more and no less. Instead of saying that “there are a lot of fish in the sea” and that the little one will have dozens of green spatulas in his lifetime (are you comforted by something like that when you lose something you like?) you can just say: “You must be very sad, you really liked that spatula”. The effect can surprise you! The reticent Matthias may have surprisingly accurate observations regarding this situation.\n\n**· Let the emotions die down** \\- the waiter just brought you a cold drink. You want to take the first sip, but the phone rings. It’s the grandmother’s number. You feel shivers down your spine. What now? In the receiver you can only hear tears and sobbing. Little Katie wants to immediatly return to her own home. Rational questions about this outburst do not prompt any answer. They only thing you hear is: “I wanna go home”! Begin with the first point: accept the irritation of the child and...let it be expressed. You hear that the child is nervous. Say it aloud. Describe everything you hear. Do not rush. The child needs time to calm down. Listen, nod, sigh but do not overwhelm your child with questions or arguments. Do not expect rational answers. He probably does not know himself whether he is tired, hungry, homesick, or annoyed by the smell from his grandma\u0027s pantry. \n\n**· Present a choice** \\- when the emotions die down you can go foward to the next step. Try to outline a possible “out” from a difficult situation. More than one! It is important for the child to decide what to do next: “Katie you probably miss home and you feel insecure. Everything around makes you angry and irritated. Maybe you\u0027ll ask grandmother to hug you and sing something to you, or take your teddy bear on the swing behind the house? I have a feeling that he also feels the same. \" The ability to make even the simplest decision gives the child great power. When he regains control of the situation, his good mood will probably come back.\n\n**· Describe your position** \\- imagine that the boss at the last moment refuses your leave, and when you ask about the reasons for his decision, he replies: \"no because no.\" You would be mad right? In everyday life, it\u0027s easy to forget that children\u0027s problems also need a discerning approach and respect. The behaviour of a wasp that bites is nothing new to you but to small person it might seem like a sort of high alchemy, an injustice of the cosmos, an unwanted suffering. Do not give lectures on how to bravely face pain even if your mobile provider has withdrawn roaming charges and you can talk big when in Tenerife. Instead use a combination of already-mentioned pointers. Try to speak using the simplest of words. Those are the ones that go straight to the heart! It must hurt a lot. You are sorry, that Anthony got this beatiful, sunny afternoon ruined by that terrible wasp. The problem is that the scared insect sometimes bites in its own defense and we can do nothing about it. We can help the child to smoothly go through this situation - accepting his feelings and devoting our attention to them. If Anthony could pay the wasp back for this rather nasty bite what would he do?\n\n**· Try a joke** \\- maybe we could paint the wasp’s stripes from yellow-black to blue-pink? Or made her sound like a rubber chicken instead of buzzing? That would be something! Other wasps would know that you don’t mess with Anthony!\n\n\u0026#x200B;\n\nIt all may seem pretty obvious or even trite! Show respect for other people’s (or rather a small person’s) feelings and autonomy, try a joke to lighten the atmosphere, show interest... In the meantime, in real life we have to act immediately, we often get carried away by emotions, we do not have time to rethink our answers, or we are just busy and we simply have no idea how to come up with the intricate anatomy of bees from an alternative reality. Before a new balloon that is currently freely flying away or a sudden nettle burn verify our skills and pro-children approach it is worth to get some valuable knowledge and make a cheat sheet or use a ready-made one. \n\n\u0026#x200B;\n\n**Mythic Owl**, a company dealing with mobile education games, created the [Parenting Hero application](https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/21/parenting-hero-helps-parents-figure-out-how-to-talk-to-their-kids/), which can be an irreplaceable help for parents - both those who travel and those who stay at home with kids. It is a **collection of short, animated scenes** that feature both parents and children in a variety of situations - both everyday and uncommon.\n\nWith each problematic situation we pick our reaction to the presented event and the app shows us the next part of the story and a commentary on a given reaction in the words of the specialists - **Joanna Faber** and **Julie King**. The substantive content is based on the bestselling guide for parents of children aged 2-7 titled [“How to Talk so Little Kids Will Listen: A Survival Guide to Life with Children Ages 2-7”](https://www.amazon.com/Talk-Little-Kids-Will-Listen/dp/150113163X) by the aftermentioned authors. \n\nThe application allows you to quickly find out what is the essence of the knowledge presented in the book and practice the use of this knowledge. It equips us with proven and simple tools that enable effective communication with the child. Problems that often repeat in our own everyday life can be added to “favourites” so that we can - for example - return to them during a difficult conversation. Keep calm! The delegation must happen and you deserve to relax.\n\n[Here](http://www.mythicowl.com/parentinghero/en) you can find more information about Parenting Hero.",

  "title": "How to tell children about their deadbeat mother having a new baby?",
  "selftext": "I know the title is harsh but its the honest truth. \n\nI (23F) have been dating my boyfriend (28M) for a year and he has 3 kids (8m, 4f, 3f), from a previous marriage. He has full 100\u0026#37; custody of the kids and the children will be seeing their mother for the first time in 10 months on Saturday. Their mother lost all custodial rights in court to my BF due to her **drug abuse**, refusal to work, **her abu**sing my **BF, neg**lect of the children, and a whole host of other things. She has seen the kids only 5 times in the past 2 years since the divorce. She is now curren**tly 8 months preg**nant with her boyfriend\u0027s baby (who uses meth). She currently has only paid $300 of her $1,500 a month child support payments over the past two years.... she is a deadbeat and has essentia**lly abandoned the child**ren. \n\nThe reason the children do not go to their mother\u0027s house is because during the entirety of her 9 year relationship with my BF, she claimed her father (who she now lives with) **systematically sexually abused** her as a child for a long period of time. There is a possibility we will not even be attending the party since she is currently standing firm on my BF currently allowing her father to meet the children (he has never met any of them). The ex is now **recanting her stories of abuse**, but my BF and I are in agreement that this is not a chance we are willing to take. \n\nSince I have been in the picture I have taken on a mother roll and love these children I want to be their stepmother and hopefully one day their mom. *I love this family so much.*\n\nShe decided two days ago that on Saturday she wanted to host her own birthday party for the middle child after my BF and I had extended an invitation to her to attend the party we are putting on.  So we will have to obviously tell the children about their new sibling. The oldest child already has behavioral issues and my BF and I have together been able to afford to send him to a therapist to help with the trauma of losing his stay at home mom after 6years. Neither of us are sure how to tell them and we want to do it before the party so we can set a narrative and so as not to surprise them or upset them over this news. \n\nHas anyone gone through something similar or been the child in this situation? We are confident that once this child is born their mother will go MIA again and we will be left cleaning up her aftermath. I am obviously quite young to be trying to do this but I would do *anything* to help spare these kids from the hurt they are in for this week, with feeling that their mother, who has abandoned them is now replacing them with a new child.

  "title": "12 year old daughter got a short haircut; stepmom-to-be is furious",
  "selftext": "I\u0027m looking for an outside opinion on an issue.  I have two daughters, ages 12 (from first marriage) and 2 (from fiance).  I\u0027ve been with the woman I am going to marry for 5 years now.\n\nFor the past year or so, our oldest has been asking for a short haircut.  My fiance has been adamantly opposed to this and has argued against it from a few different angles.  She has said that a girl wanting to cut her hair short (like \"boy length\" short) might be a sign of mental unhealth, of wanting to \"stand out\" to an unhealthy degree, or of simply wanting to rebel.  I\u0027m fine with the haircut idea because to me it\u0027s just hair, but I\u0027ve supported my fiance in this debate for the past year because she felt strongly about it and I didn\u0027t feel strongly either way.  Our daughter feels just as strongly about it and has kept up her side of the argument saying often that she just wants a short haircut because she thinks it would be fun, and after all it\u0027s \"her hair\".  It\u0027s been hotly debated for months.\n\n12yo is spending this Summer break at her biological mom\u0027s house.  While away, bio-mom took  12yo to get her hair cut.  It is now very short.  Bio-mom sent me a pic which I shared with my fiance and how fiance is furious.  We argued about it this morning; me arguing the \"I just want everyone to be as happy as possible as often as possible and it\u0027s just a haircut it\u0027s no big deal\" side, and my fiance arguing her usual points mentioned above.  We were both getting ready for work so were unable to conclude the conversation, but agreed that we would have to after work.\n\nMy question to you all..... how big a deal is this haircut?  12yo is a straight A student, not into drugs or sex, on Prozac for diagnosed depression after we caught her lying about talking to strangers on the internet and discovering she had dabbled in cutting herself, and otherwise just a normal kid.  She finally got the haircut she wanted but had to do so basically behind our backs.\n\nNote about the bio-mom:  she\u0027s within her rights to take 12yo to get a haircut.  It\u0027s actually one of the details in our divorce decree that she is the tiebreaker vote in a situation like this, I think.  She\u0027s been a bit absent due to moving about an hour away after we divorced, but 12yo still adores her and has even asked to go live with her.  12yo has said she doesn\u0027t want to live with me and fiance because it\u0027s too hard to live with fiance.\n\nThanks, parents.  Any perspective you can offer is appreciated.  And just to be clear, I\u0027m not asking for advice on dealing with either the fiance or bio-mom.  I\u0027m really just wanting opinions on how much a haircut really matters.",

  "title": "Should I let him be in his life, or cut ties with the father?",
  "selftext": "At the moment, I\u0027m going through a really confusing, and difficult time. If you take the time to read this, just know I truly appreciate it, as I know it\u0027s a long post. I feel stupid sometimes asking strangers online for advice, or their opinions. But, I feel as if I have nobody to turn to, and as if my family is biased on the situation, and they don’t quite understand how I feel. \n\n I turned 19 years old the beginning of June, and I am 22 weeks pregnant. My baby\u0027s father (ex boyfriend) is 32. I found out I was pregnant at an early time of 4 weeks. I took an early result pregnancy test 6 days before I even missed my period, because I had a feeling deep down I was pregnant, due to my carelessness, and my at the time boyfriends carelessness. I made 2 abortion appointments, and cancelled the first one because I was extremely sick with the flu, and the other because I had doubts. I didn’t think I could personally live with that decision. I’ve always felt women could decide what to do with their bodies, after all, it is their lives. But for me personally, I always felt like I’d have a deep regret later on in life, especially wondering what my child would’ve been like, or looked like.\n\n  I considered adoption for a while, but I didn’t think I could stand to watch my baby go to another home. I couldn’t stand knowing my child is out there with someone else, not knowing what their life is like. I know with me at least, they’d always be well taken care of, and loved. So, I went back and forth many many MANY times, and then finally decided, keeping my baby was the best option for me. I know I probably confused my boyfriend at the time with my constant changes of mind, but I was struggling internally on what to do. I knew having a baby was a major life changing event, and I wanted to make sure I explored every option before making a decision. I do admit, he seemed supportive of anything I wanted. He was willing to pay for the abortion if I wanted it, he was willing to look into adoption, but he did say at that time he preferred to keep the baby, and raise it together. \n\n Back in December, I was involved in a car accident. My car ended up being totaled, and my insurance wrote me a check, and I was able to purchase a brand new one. My grandparents (who were buying it), and I, went to the local car dealership. As soon as I got out of the car, I noticed a man standing in the window.He was a salesman. I\u0027ll never forget the feeling I had- I liked him. It was so strange because he was standing all the way across the parking lot, but I just got these butterfly feelings in my stomach. He came over to me, and he ask what car I was interested in. I told him, and we went over and looked at it. I remember as he walked away, I told my mother \"he\u0027s so cute\". I was a bit interested in him from the jump, I was very attracted to him. \n\n He gave me his business card which happened to have his personal number on it. From that point on, we only really communicated about the vehicle until Christmas time came. We ended up talking a bit more on a \"personal”, and less business level. He told me he thought I was hot, and we made plans to go out on New Years. I got sick, and cancelled. I ask him out to the movies about a week later. I noticed from the start that he seemed a bit \"awkward\". I kinda brushed that off as us just not knowing each other well, and nerves.\n\n On our third date, we ended up trying to have sex. By trying, I mean he couldn\u0027t keep an erection. Once we got into his bedroom, he revealed to me that he was a virgin. Considering he was 32, I was very taken back, but didn\u0027t make a huge fuss. I simply smiled and said \"oh okay then, that’s understandable, if you don\u0027t want to try we can just stop tonight”. He agreed to just stop for now.\n\n  He told me that he NEVER been in a \"relationship”, and had only gone on a few dates. I ask him if he was just waiting for the right person before sex, and he said no, that he thinks he has \"performance anxiety\" and that he attempted to have sex before a long time ago (like years), but he couldn\u0027t, so it was just oral. I’m not going to lie, I have many doubts about this, and wonder if he was making all that up, and lying about being a virgin. I ask him, and he assured me he was telling the truth, so I let it go. Many attempts later, we were finally able to start having sex, without him losing his erection. I\u0027ll admit, the sex was never great for me. We only ever had sex in one position- from the back. I went on top a couple times, but he only went on top once. We never really had passionate sex. I also had so many issues with his lack of erection, by the time we actually had sex, I was exhausted and no longer even in the mood. You would think when someone is pregnant, you’d naturally want to be more gentle with them. I know sex is usually safe during pregnancy, but most men are a bit more cautious with their pregnant partners. Sometimes I’d say “ouch” or “owe that hurts”, and not once did he ever say “hey are you okay?”, or something. He’d just keep going. I finally once turned around, and told him to be gentle, it hurts. \n\nI\u0027m not really the type of person to focus solely on looks, so him being merely average to me wasn\u0027t really a deal breaker because his personality made up for it-at first. I started to find myself second guessing if I was even attracted to him. He is extremely skinny (I\u0027m talking 5\u002710, 129 pounds), and I am a very petite 5\u00273 female, 120 pounds. You could literally see his bones. \n\nHe also dressed extremely childish outside of work. At work, he looked very neat and put together, but every date he wore immature \"character\" shirts, and cartoons. I tried so hard to overlook all of this, but his personality was making it worse, because I began to notice we didn’t really seem to click. We went on a 3 day trip because he had to take some classes out of town for his place of work. I began to feel like I could never truly be myself around him, almost as if our relationship wasn\u0027t progressing how it should be. At this point, we had known each other 2 months, and there was still awkward silences.\n\nI never felt like I could really \"laugh\" and \"let loose\" with him. I started to see we never had much in common. His friend group is MUCH older, and it was very awkward for me because I was too scared to ever meet them. I knew these people and I wouldn\u0027t click. Even basic things like music, we didn\u0027t really have in common. But, I \\*continued\\* to make excuses because he was doing a few things right. He planned nice dates (movies, bowling, air-hockey, picnics, museums, etc). I never had a man do things like this for me before, so I guess I was focused on the material things. I will admit, he made a lot of effort to plan nice dates. He took me a lot of places, and didn’t seem to have problems paying for every date. After all, he did know I was 18 at the time, living with mom, going to school, with no job. He was fully aware I was just a student, and didn’t bring anything to the table financially. Anybody can buy you gifts, and anybody can pay for nice, or \"fancy\" dates, but that doesn\u0027t mean they are \\*in love\\* with you. That\u0027s where I believe I got confused. \n\nHe planned nice dates, but I always thought \"I would be having more fun if I were with someone else\". This was actually the first man I’d ever been on a real date with. When I was younger, our parents would always drop us both off somewhere, or we’d just hangout at his house. I’d never really had a man take me out like that before. I constantly thought “well if he didn’t care about you, he wouldn’t be spending money on you, or trying to take you these places, he must actually care”. I think in my mind, I felt like I might never find anyone else, especially after my previous relationship. I tried to open up to him a bit about my past. I was sexually assaulted, and in an abusive relationship with my ex back in 2015. He raped me, and I took it to court. This was the first relationship I had even attempted to get in since. I remember opening up to him about my past was something I felt was very important because it has had a lot of impact as to the woman I am today. I have some trust issues because of it, but I felt like I was only hurting myself by continuing to isolate myself, and not at least try to be happy again. The first red flag was his reaction. He was EXTREMELY nonchalant, and downplayed the situation which actually hurt me. He said \"a lot of girls have stalkers\". I wasn\u0027t stalked, I was assaulted.\n\nMy ex had a very bad past himself. His mother was murdered by his father as a young boy, and his father ended up murdering 2 other people- one being the neighbor. My ex actually wrote a book about it, and discussed how growing up he was always very jealous of others. He was bullied, and had thoughts of \"blowing up the school\", or \"making bombs to create the mass number of deaths.\" He said as a teen, he committed a number of internet crimes, which I\u0027m not exactly sure what. I will admit, I was a bit disturbed by some of what I read, but I tried to realize he\u0027s much older now, and maybe he has changed. He never seemed to have any type of compassion towards my assault what so ever though.\n\n One day, we went to his work function which was held at a event center, with live music, restaurants, a bar, etc. It included a one night resort hotel stay. I was 18 at the time, and him being 32, he could legally drink. They didn\u0027t card me I guess because they believed I was over-age since everyone there was atleast 29, and in their 40\u0027s. I got very drunk, as this was the first time I had ever had tequila, and I didn\u0027t know it would affect me so badly. I had drank alcohol in the past, but nothing more than some wine-coolers, and a few shots of Jack Daniels in the house. I noticed he never expressed ANY sort of jealousy or protectiveness over me.\n\nI don\u0027t want anyone to be controlling, but I do think there should always be a healthy amount of jealously because thats normal in people who actually care about their significant others. Other guys would stare at me drunk, and I\u0027d notice him kinda \"smirk\" at them. That’s another problem I’ve had with him is that he never seemed to express much emotion. He actually told me prior before in the relationship he had a hard time showing emotions. We got up to the hotel room, and tried to have sex, but again, he couldn\u0027t stay hard. This is the night I looked in his phone, and found Tinder. I had \\*never\\* seen this there before. He had my phone password, and I had his. I had used his phone prior before many times, and would\u0027ve seen this app. If I seen it drunk, I would\u0027ve seen it before. I got so hurt, I started crying. I ask him how he could do this to me, and why would he. He laid on the bed and carelessly said \"it was there before you and I started dating\". I told him I knew it wasn’t, and continued to cry. He just sat there, and acted like he couldn\u0027t give a damn less. Drunk me, told him I was leaving. I then told him I was calling an uber and he once said \"you shouldn\u0027t\", then he just said \"okay.\"\n\nHe let me wander out of the hotel, drunk. He never once came looking for me, nothing. I ended up with a male co-worker of his, and his girlfriend. He took me back to his room, and told me to just stay there for right now. I ask him to please call my boyfriend to come to his room to get me because we had just gotten into a fight because he cheated. Well this man\u0027s girlfriend happened to be drunk too. She literally pulled off my dress, and her and I became “friends”. We kissed a few times, and I did it out of pure anger and hurt...along with being drunk. The man said we needed to just calm down, and got us some water. Well my boyfriend came up to the room and just stared at me, and said \"come on\". He walked ahead of me, and we went back to our room. That whole night, and entire next day, he never mummed a word to me. He never tried to explain, nothing. I knew it was a lie, and he had cheated on me. The Tinder was never in there before regardless of what he said. \n\nHe’s never tried to fight for our relationship, and would always let me go extremely easily. I believe there was one time he did send me a long text message telling I was his “one and only true love”. But this was after the fact I had gotten on to him so much about never trying to work things out, or communicate. So I don’t feel as if it was genuine. \n\nA few days later, I found out I was pregnant from back when we had that 3 day trip. At this point, I got back together with him because I knew we were having a child together. I ask him what he wanted, and he said he wanted to be with me, and have this baby. We started looking at apartments because he wanted to get us a place, and even talked about marrying me. We found an apartment that was in a pretty bad area. We also found another for the same exact price, brand new, 5 minutes from my grandparents house, his work, and about 10 from my college. So it would only make sense to pick the nicer one, especially since it’s the exact same price, and even brand new. I told him I didn’t feel safe in the other area, and he said \"well I wont be outside\". I said \"but your baby and I will\". And he just laughed kinda in a sarcastic way. Even looking at places, we couldn’t really agree, and it wasn’t really a fun experience.\n\n I was going to move in, but I changed my mind. I realized I didn\u0027t have to move in with him so soon, or marry him just because we were having a baby. I knew this whole thing was moving extremely fast anyways, so I decided to just stay at home with my mom for the time being. They told me I could just continue to go to college full time, and focus on raising my son. He told me a few times he thinks it\u0027d be best if I moved in with him, but I told him lets just hold off a while. \n\nWe had a lot of fights in between, and I broke up with him. May 10th, we went to the baby\u0027s ultrasound. It was him, my grandparents, and mother. The whole time, he never made any comments at all. The ultrasound tech was very sweet and talkative, my family all made comments like \"awh look at his little feet, and look at him move\". He recorded it on his phone, and I never once heard him make any remarks about his baby. This ultrasound was completely different than the first one we went to, while we were together. That one, he seemed so interested, held my hand, looked happy. This one, he acted completely different, and was very quiet. \n\nAfter the ultrasound, we ended up going out to eat with my family afterwards, then me and him went to his house. I remember in the car, grabbing his hand, and he looked at me and said \"I love you\". We got back together that day, but sometimes I wonder if he only did that for the sex we had that night. I remember a few days before we had talked about sex, and he said \"anytime you want to have sex, come over\".\n\nWe ended up breaking up a few days later after I thought something was wrong with the baby. I made a trip to the ER where he met me and my mother there. Turns out, I got a severe case of BV after our sex. So May 12th, was the final day we were \"together\". \n\nAfter breaking up, he\u0027s never went out and bought his son anything himself. I have to send him all the baby lists of items of things to order online. It got to the point when we were broken up, he never even ask about his son. He would always say \"I want to keep an open line of communication about my son\" but yet I had to tell him every appointment, \\*I\\* had to get on to him about even texting me to ask about his son. An argument we had made him not even come over and set up his son\u0027s baby furniture. I told him it doesn\u0027t matter if we were mad, that is his child, and not an excuse to not come over.\n\nNeedless to say, my grandfather put together all my baby\u0027s furniture. There\u0027s been numerous incidents where he has made up lies on his boss. He said his boss at work said my grandparents had \"martial issues\". My mother was very offended by this because she said that this was not true, and no one should be saying anything about her parents like that to begin with. His boss actually knows my grandparents, because he sold them a car 17 years ago. My mother called his boss, and his boss said he was actually going to call her. He said he was very confused, and never said this. My mom and him had a pretty long conversation, but that was it. My ex made up a lie that my mother called his work and talked to 3 co-workers about our personal issues, which was not true. My mother bought another car, and only ask for a different salesman that was not my ex.\n\nShe never talked to \"3 co-workers about our business”, which was confirmed by the general manager- the man she supposedly talked to about our “business”. I started getting rude answers from him. For example, I texted him about ordering something for his son, and he said \"I will tomorrow, if I remember\". Then another time, he blew me off about his son and told me he was \"with his friends\". I\u0027d send him a picture of my stomach, no reply. He says he \"wants to be involved\", but yet never makes any effort. He’s bought his son everything I’ve ask him to to order, but that’s it. We sat down with a lawyer, and typed up a child support agreement. He says he \"works 50 hours a week\", and would be too tired to keep the baby any more than twice a week on his days off. So, he is just coming to my house twice a week, then leaving. Needless to say, I took full custody.\n\n He has no problem staying out all night with his friends though. The most recent situation is when I snooped on his Facebook. I seen him in some photos with another woman, and stupid me accidentally tagged him in a photo of HER. I was so embarrassed but played it off like I was only on his page because I wanted to screenshot some of his behavior to show my attorney.Turns out this woman has children herself. We\u0027re struggling to find time for his own baby, and now he gets involved with a woman WITH children. He changed his relationship status the other night while they took a picture at the bar at 2 in the morning, so they are \"in a relationship”. Not even just dating. It has been 1 month, and 6 days since we broke up, and he was just telling me he loved me. How is this even possible he is in a relationship THIS soon, unless he was \"seeing her\" while we were together. \n\nIt infuriates me to no end that here it is, I am carrying his child, and he doesn\u0027t even check on how he\u0027s doing, nothing. But he stays out all night, and is already with another woman. I’m not going to lie, I did look this woman up, and she is no one I would even consider having around my children. I respect peoples religion and views on religion, but I came from a Christian home. She is an atheist, and a judgmental one at that. She constantly bashes God, or people who believe in him. She actually said her son came to her, and said “mommy I don’t want to say bless you anymore because you don’t believe in God”. She does videos online, and every word out of her mouth is a cuss word- literally. She constantly drinks, and said she actually left her liquor beside her child’s sippycup, and he picked hers up and ask “mommy whats this?”. She talks about “dick appointments”, and sex with men constantly. It’s just really trashy, disgusting behavior. \n\nI\u0027m really hurt by our entire situation. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s so much the fact I love \\*him\\*, or miss \\*him\\*. I do miss the affectionate times, or times I felt like I had someone to talk to, or be with. I think I just miss the fact of being in a relationship, but not with him. Looking back, I realize I was never really happy with him from the start. I think I was forcing feelings. He always made me feel inferior about my issues and problems. He made me feel like I was wrong for being upset, wrong for being hurt. He downplayed my feelings, and even once told me “our problems were just all in my head”, when they weren’t. They were legitimate feelings. I’ll admit, I said some pretty mean things to him out of anger. \n\nI told him the sex was awful, that I was never attracted to him, people were surprised he even had a date with me, etc. I was so mad after he continued to talk badly about my mother, and call her manipulative, and made up that lie on her that she called his work when she didn’t. He always put down my family, and I think he was the last person who had any right to do that considering what home he grew up in. \n\nI think it hurts me more than anything to know he didn\u0027t try to make more effort with us, and he posts his new relationship 3 weeks after we split. The fact he can go out with her all night, and drink, but then he\u0027s \"too tired\" for his son. It makes me sick because I know what its like not having a father. I wanted a family, and it hurts me. Am I wrong for just wanting my child support and to do this by myself? I don\u0027t really even feel safe with my baby around him, especially these types of people he hangs out with. I have a great family at home, who\u0027s willing to watch him while I go to college, so I don\u0027t have to put him in day care, I can focus on getting my degree to make something of myself. I know I\u0027ll be able to do this, I just get so scared.\n\n I went to his work the other day for the final time to collect a few baby things. We didn’t speak a word to each other, other then him asking where I parked, and him saying “he hopes all the boxes will fit in my car”. I stood my ground this time, and didn’t say a word to him. I wanted to see if he would even ask about his son first. Nothing. Not once did he ask how he was doing, if I had an appointment, nothing. I just simply handed him a note which had the information for the required online parenting class he had to complete, and drove away. I was in tears leaving, because I feel like he doesn’t even care about his child anymore because we are no longer together. I shouldn’t have to feel guilty breaking up with someone I wasn’t happy with. That shouldn’t change his love for his son. \n\nI don\u0027t feel as if I am really giving up any of my life because I never was a very social person to begin with. I always just went to class, talked to some people, came home, and focused on my work. It sounds strange, but I enjoy going out with my mother more than I do other friends. The majority of my friends moved, or got married and have their own lives. I usually just stay home, watch movies, go swimming, or do normal things like get my nails done or go to the mall. I don\u0027t drink, and don\u0027t ever plan on it after my last experience. I quit smoking a month before I found out I was pregnant, and I am 6 months completely cigarette free. I don\u0027t do drugs, or party. I\u0027ve really cleaned up my life a lot, and I am proud of myself. I feel as if I have moved past a lot of my trauma, and all I want to do is be a good mother. I want to raise my son to be kind, and feel loved. I am trying so hard, and I almost feel like this baby gave me a reason to live again, because I was so depressed for the longest. I feel awful for even considering abortion or adoption because I know this baby is completely innocent in all this.\n\nIf you took the time to read, thank you. So much. I\u0027d appreciate ANY advice. I just really don’t know what to do at this point in regards to the father. Part of me wishes he would change his ways, but I know that’s probably not going to happen. Obviously getting back together with this man would be a terrible idea, I feel like way too much has happened, and I’d never even be able to look at him the same way again. All I want is for him to love his son, and be there for him. But I don’t even trust him to do that. \n\nPart of me thinks I should just get the child support, and do it all by myself. It was never like this in the beginning with his son, and he just turned so bitter after we broke up. He used to be so happy about the baby, rub my stomach, ask about him, etc. All that changed after we broke up, and although he says he cares, his actions show complete otherwise. He got a new woman, and doesn’t even care to ask about him anymore. What should I do? Allow him to see the child, or just tell him he’s made his choice, and to leave us alone? \n\nI feel like if he goes from the end of May to the end of October without hearing a word from him, I should just wash my hands of the situation, and of him. I would be willing to sit down with him alone, ONE more time, to discuss all of these issues, and even try to get some sort of counseling for the both of us to help us with co-parenting..but if we speak, it’ll be on HIS terms. I highly doubt I’ll even hear from him anytime soon, especially since I just seen him and he didn\u0027t even care to say anything then. He’ll just be waiting on the call that his son is born. I guess my question is, am I wrong for just taking the child support and telling him to stay away from us? Believe me, if I didn\u0027t have to take the money, I wouldn\u0027t but $750 a month will help me GREATLY to raise him, especially while in school. I just don\u0027t know what to do, but my heart tells me I should just tell him he\u0027s made his choice, so go on with his life and leave us be. ",

  "selftext": "My 10mo old son was stung by a bumblebee last week. I took him to the ER about 3hrs after the fact on the advice of Poison Control after he developed a widespread rash and vomited. He broke out in hives at the hospital. He was given benedryl and an oral steroid. I gave him benedryl twice more the next day per the doctor\u0027s orders as he was still a bit rashy.\n\nWe saw his pediatrician and she prescribed him an EpiPen, well Auvi-Q, an alternative epinephrine autoinjector.

I\u0027m pretty forgetful. The doc said the medicine can\u0027t be kept in the car. Should we have multiple doses laying around? And my kids play outside 24/7. I instituted a shoes on rule while they\u0027re outside (a day late and a dollar short) but what else should I be thinking? Can we go for long hikes with him? backpacking without cell service? We are a very outdoorsy family. I\u0027m worried for my little guy but I don\u0027t want to lock him indoors forever either. We\u0027ve been going to the park every night and I\u0027ve already forgotten the benedryl. My current MO is to pick him up and run when I see a bee. I can\u0027t tell if I\u0027m under or overreacting here.",

  "selftext": "My mother has a mark on her lip that she says is from when she went scuba diving 20 years ago and got a piece of coral stuck in it. It “flairs” up every now and again and at the moment it is visible. I think it looks like a cold sore. \nI have a 5.5 month old son and every time she sees him she smothers him in kisses. I’m a bit of a germaphobe anyway but I said to her that while she had that thing on her lip I’d rather if she didn’t kiss him. She got so angry in front of other family too, and basically rolled her eyes/gave me the silent treatment for days. I had already brought this up privately beforehand and she still went ahead and kissed him anyway. I felt so bad that I had hurt her, but it gives me BIG anxiety that if it’s a cold sore my son will get it and we all know that it’s very dangerous for babies to get the herpes virus. \nWell, today she came over and she is showering him in kisses again. I noticed that she still has a mark on her lip. It’s been about 2-3 weeks since the first incident - would a cold sore be around that long? \nI got very anxious and she kept on asking me what was wrong. I was afraid to bring it up again because of how mad she got last time. I let her hold the baby while I did some tidying up and all I can hear is her kissing the baby all over his face. I went back into the room and tried to say casually, “so you still have that thing on your lip, huh?” . She said sarcastically “yes it’s always there” (it’s not). And then she said to the baby “mummy thinks I’m germy”. \nUgh. I’ve already told her that it makes me really anxious. I’ve told her how dangerous it is to babies. Why does she keep on doing it? I feel like she doesn’t respect me as an adult or a mother. I washed my babies’ face with a washer when she left but I still feel really anxious. 😢\nAm I overreacting? I feel like she’s gone away feeling bad again and that just makes me feel terrible, but I wish she’d just listen. ",

  "selftext": "May be an interesting topic of discussion, I hope it belongs in this subreddit. \n\nA friend of mine (22yo) voiced to me some frustration after she’d learned that her mother had given her younger sister (11yo) the “crush” talk, meaning the girls liking boys talk, the “liking boys is normal and natural” talk. Her anger came from how heteronormative her mother was being with her (secretly queer) young sister who had very recently confided in her that she was beginning to explore and question her sexuality and her affinity for girls over boys. \n\nOf course without outing her younger sister, my friend gently asked her mother why she’s chosen to have this kind of talk rather than a more broad “people like people” sort of discussion, centering around mutual respect and keeping boundaries. She reminded her mother that around her sister’s current age she was beginning to question her own sexuality, and expressed that a conversation that validated gay relationships would’ve helped her to feel more confident in herself. Her mother then exploded on her, asking her to keep her parenting advice to herself, reminding her that she is still her mother, and essentially asking her to f*** off. \n\nI feel as though my friend has an incredibly solid point as well as appropriate standing as the child’s eldest sister to be able to have *some say in how her sister is being taught about the world. My friend being bisexual herself struggled with sharing her female relationships with her mother because she never felt taken seriously. It seems important to her that her sister doesn’t experience the same discomfort. \n\nMy question is how you would handle an eldest child essentially giving you feedback on how your own parenting techniques have failed in the past?",

  "selftext": "I\u0027m not sure \"Parenting\" is quite the right sub for this, but as it pertains to children I figure I might get some good input here.\n\nMy 11yo niece-in-law is visiting and spending the night.  She\u0027s a pretty good kid, good head on her shoulders, but she comes from a rough past and is around some less than savory influences (though her home is a safe place, otherwise I\u0027d demand she be here with us).  She\u0027s officially hit puberty and has gone full blown boy crazy and was telling me about various boyfriends.  She mentioned one she \"broke up with\" because he had anger issues.  Long story short she told me he \"beats up\" all of his ex\u0027s (this boy us 10, mind you).  I pressed for clarification and she insists he literally beats them up, that he beat her up.  I\u0027m sitting there feeling kind of mind blown, again, pressing to be sure she\u0027s not using the term in some weird way, and she described how he pushed pushed her to the ground and kicked her and had his knee on the back of her neck but she managed to kick him in the face.  She told me he runs around fighting people a lot and smokes.  She showed me pictures commenting about how \"he was really high in that one\".  SHE\u0027S 11 YEARS OLD!!!!  She went on to tell me how his dad beats girls up too, that he just got out of jail for it.  I started trying impress upon her the seriousness of this issue but she was fairly flippant about it.  I really tried to stress to NEVER let anyone treat her that way and that it\u0027s ok to tell someone and ask for help.\n\nSo my issue here is that I\u0027ve just been told about a 10 year old who\u0027s smoking, doing drugs, and running around beating people/being beaten up.  She told me their names and I googled the father and from what I could find he has indeed been in some serious legal trouble.  I found one report that did actually include assault involving punching a woman in the nose.  So there seems to be validity to what she\u0027s telling me and she\u0027s never given me reason to doubt or mistrust her.  She likes me and tends to open up to me pretty freely (once even telling me she wishes I was her mom and often urging us to love to a bigger place with a \"spare\" bedroom).  But now here I am knowing about this boy, this young child, who is living this life of horrible learned behavior.  I imagine odds are good he\u0027s been abused himself.  It\u0027s very sad and troubling that this is the road this boy has been sent down but at this point he\u0027s old enough to know right from wrong.  I want to intervene for his sake and for the safety of my niece and the other little girls that all seem to live in and roam the trailer park, but uiw do I go about that?  Do I call CPS or some other social service and sound the alarm about this boy\u0027s situation?  Do I do it anonymously?  Will they listen to me when all I ha e is the word of an 11yo girl?\n\nThis is all so disturbing...what do I do?!",

  "title": "How do I get over being resentful of DD\u0027s dad",
  "selftext": " I’m so sorry for the wall of text here, but I need to vent and I think it helps explain where my mind is.\n\nHere\u0027s the backstory: I met him (XBF) while we were in the military overseas. We hadn\u0027t been dating for very long when I found out he was pregnant. He refused to be part of the decision, refused to help me find out all of the information on how to follow through with an abortion (my original decision) in a foreign country whose language I couldn’t speak or read. I did set the appointment but didn’t have the heart to follow through, so I told him that I wanted to keep the baby and that I wanted to break up. He told me that no, he wanted to be there and we could get married. Coming from a family where my parents hated, and still hate, each other but refused to get a divorce, I told him I didn\u0027t want to put myself in a relationship just because of a baby. He still decided to tell \\*everyone\\* that we were going to get married.  \n \n\nFlash-forward to the pregnancy: He\u0027s deployed, I\u0027m at a shore command. I had no friends and my family refused to come see me. I spend all of my savings buying a car, baby furniture, making a security deposit, etc so I’m stressed out of my mind all the time. He kept telling me that he’d help me with money (he made more than I did) but he never did. When he finally got into a US port for a month and got approved for a week of leave, but decided to go to Las Vegas with his guy friends instead of seeing me. During that time he didn’t want to video chat because he could see the baby move in my stomach if I angled the webcam a certain way and it grossed him out. His (as we were told) recovering mom comes to stay with me for the birth. She brings her super ill-behaved dogs with her and XBF\u0027s cat. She helps cook but she barely cleans up after herself or any of the animals even though they shit everywhere, spends a large amount of time telling me stories about XBF\u0027s ex-girlfriends in order to get a rise out of me, and spends a lot of time on the phone with one of her friends loudly (I could hear her across the house) making fun of the name we chose for our DD.\n\nFlash-forward to the birth: Water breaks in the middle of the night, 17 hours of labor later, DD is born. XBF\u0027s mom takes the opportunity to drink now that I\u0027m stuck in the hospital and can\u0027t keep tabs on her. Doctors say I have postpartum depression. I keep randomly breaking out in hives everywhere (I would much, much later find out that that was due to postpartum thyroiditis) and I\u0027m alone for 3 days with little sleep and surrounded by several nurses who won’t listen to any of my concerns about my hives and bladder pains. I get the opportunity to video chat XBF, but he spend the entire call bragging about how everyone was buying him shots as a new dad.  \n \n\nFlash-forward to him arriving to my command: He spent every weekend going out and getting shitfaced with his friends and wouldn’t wake up until noon the following days. I once asked him to not go out, he took the request as a personal insult and acted as though I was abusing him by locking him up and keeping him from seeing his friends. I eventually relented. He preferred going out to spending time with his daughter. I used to wake up at 4 every morning to get myself and my daughter ready and I would pick her up every day even though he got out of work hours before I did. He didn\u0027t seem to know or care about anything related to child rearing even though I bought him baby books to read underway, he wouldn’t play with her, and he wouldn\u0027t take her anywhere but if I had to run errands, he expected me to take her with me so he could nap or play videogames. He\u0027d have me take her with us to house parties (though he\u0027d tell me they were small get-togethers) so he could show her off then dump her on me while he got shitfaced with his friends (who would ignore me and DD). Eventually I had a breakdown at one party and left with DD because I couldn\u0027t stand how lonely I was with him. When he got home, I let him know that I was unhappy in our relationship and he got so mad he started screaming at me and throwing things (not at me though). He refused to talk it over or to consider couple\u0027s counseling, and yet he got super mad because I moved out of our room to the room closest to DD\u0027s. I wound up breaking up with him, but we stayed in the same house even though things were super tense. Then he decided to let a friend stay with us. Said friend defused most of our disagreements (we tried not to yell), but he was also so immature that he did something that could’ve killed our DD (more details \\[here\\] ([https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8u2mb9/whats\\_the\\_most\\_horrifying\\_or\\_disrespectful\\_thing/e1cgkjb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8u2mb9/whats_the_most_horrifying_or_disrespectful_thing/e1cgkjb/)). I kicked friend out and XBF gets mad at \\*me\\* for throwing away our friendship. I get mad back and tell him that if he was going to choose people over his own child, then I have no problem taking her out of his life. I think that was the point where he started \\*trying.\\*\n\nFlash-forward to me leaving the military: I went to stay with my parents and took DD with me. Shit happened with my mother and brother that winds up with me constantly venting to XBF. He invited me to come stay with him since things weren’t working out with my family and I take him up on the offer. He even helped us move our stuff and helped me with half of the cost of the plane tickets. \n\nSo now we’re living with him. The roles have swapped a little since now he pays the bulk of the bills which has made him a little resentful, but it’s not too bad. He does interact with DD more (not enough for my liking since he’ll still choose to spend his weekends partying rather than taking her out somewhere). But I’m still highly resentful of him and it’s only been exacerbated by 1) him pursuing a relationship with a girl who is currently in a relationship and 2) him recently visiting the friend who almost killed DD. It feels like I’m trying to be an adult here by getting my career going and focusing on getting my shit together, and he’s still acting like a kid. I’ve been told that I’m too hard on him since “guys mature slower than women” and that he’s doing his best. I don’t know if I’m just being a bitch here.",

  "selftext": "What would you do if you found out the little boy (8yo) across the street didn\u0027t just talk about sex with your 7yo daughter but demonstrated sex using a pillow?  \n\nThe way I found out was equally disturbing. My daughter asked me some questions that made me think, \"oh wow, I\u0027m not ready to have the birds and the bees talk!\" but we talk and it\u0027s going ok when she tells me she\u0027s not a virgin. I asked her why she thinks that and she said because she cuddles with her pillow sometimes...like \u0027Sam\u0027 does. (changed his name)...  That\u0027s when I learn about him showing my kids and his younger siblings how to have sex and that he watches it on the computer. \n\nThe next day I go over and talk to his mom who tells me they\u0027ve been dealing with his \u0027insomnia\u0027 for a while and one of the things they discovered was he was getting on the computer at 2:00 am and searching \u0027woman big boobs\u0027 and other words that would seem dirty to an eight year old kid. You don\u0027t have to be a wordsmith to find porn on the internet though, and the stuff that\u0027s out there today is disturbing even to adults. I can\u0027t begin to imagine the effect it will have on someone his age. \n\nIt wasn\u0027t until after they caught him that they put parental controls on but then they caught him asking to visit Grandma more...same thing there. Every time he got caught he would find another house and use their internet. Every time he came to our house he would search all over for the kids tablets or try to get on our computer. The kids don\u0027t have internet on their tablet plus we have the rule of no electronics when playing with friends. I never let any kid ever use my computer but the way he zones everything out looking for anything with an internet connection is very disturbing...like an animal in heat. One time he even snatched it back and growled when my husband went to take the iPad from him. (The iPad I hid from him specifically that he searched my house for, because even before I knew about the porn I knew he would make a b-line for the iPad) There are so many issues with this kid  but it feels like my husband and I are the only ones taking this seriously. Are we blowing this out of proportion? \n\nMy kids are no longer allowed to play in their house and he\u0027s not allowed to play with any kids alone, inside or outside (my rules, not his parents). If he\u0027s there, I\u0027m watching them. His mom knows it\u0027s an issue but she thinks the issue is mine to deal with. She\u0027ll ask if my daughter can spend the night with her daughter then assure me her son is spending the night with another friend so it\u0027s \u0027safe\u0027... Why is she helping my kids avoid him instead of addressing the issue? My rules are in place because that\u0027s what\u0027s in my power to control. It\u0027s like I\u0027m an OR Nurse and his mom is the surgeon and I\u0027m packing the wound and using suction after she clipped an artery, and instead of fixing the lacerated artery she\u0027s handing me more sponges... Fix the problem! I\u0027ll do my job but she has to do hers. \n\nTL;DR    \nThe question is, can his words or actions hurt my kids?  Psychologically and emotionally, yes. Physically, possibly. \n\nWhat can I do to protect them?",

  "title": "When experts tell me to spank.",
  "selftext": "I\u0027ll start with, my 8 yo adopted daughter (came to our home at 13 months due to gross neglect) was recently diagnosed with Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD). The psychologist told me that she believes there is abuse, perhaps sexual abuse, in her first year that she can\u0027t articulate but still subconsciously suffers from. \n\nFor those who don\u0027t know RAD, it is rare in the general population, but not uncommon among kids who spent early years in foster care. To oversimplify, she isn\u0027t fully self aware, and she doesn\u0027t form true family/love connections with anyone, including us (that isn\u0027t fully accurate, but it is a quick description). \n\nDiscipline of RAD kids is extremely difficult as they don\u0027t bond. Most discipline (extra chores, time out, time in, loss of privileges, loss of toys...) doesn\u0027t work. Right now we are laser focused on correcting two related behaviors: theft and lying. She steals whenever she gets the chance and tells obvious lies about it. (Example: she stole a large bottle of hand sanitizer off the teacher\u0027s desk and shoved it in her backpack. Me: \"Why did you steal this?\" Daughter: \"I didn\u0027t daddy, it must have fallen into my backpack.\") \n\nAt the advice of her therapist, we have removed her bedroom door, bathroom cabinet doors, dresser drawers, given her a clear backpack, and placed all her toys in a common area so everything she plays with can be seen. Her room is now pretty bare, bed, a dresser with no drawers and clothes on top, clothes hanging in the closet with nothing else. It breaks my heart, I keep asking \u0027is all this necessary\u0027, and the only answer I can come to is \u0027yes\u0027.\n\nWe haven\u0027t tried spanking. First, when she was a foster child it was forbidden by law. She is adopted now, and we LEGALLY could spank. I just know what the research says about negative impacts on kids, ESPECIALLY kids with abuse in their background.\n\nYesterday the therapist suggested we try spanking her when she lies to us (not steals, as we rarely catch her stealing, we just catch her with what she stole, she is INCREDIBLY observant and opportunistic). The therapist said keep it controlled, one swat of the hand to her bottom when she tells an obvious lie. I called the psychologist and she agreed it was worth trying. \n\nI haven\u0027t seen any peer reviewed study endorsing spanking. I know there is anecdotal evidence of \u0027it worked on me\u0027 (which applies to me, my parents believed in spanking), but the research generally says it should be a last resort or more likely not used at all.\n\nWhat do you think, do I listen to the generic experts with published data, or is spanking worth trying based on the therapist and psychologist (who both are highly respected) who actually see and know my daughter?\n\n",

She\u0027s not terminal like cancer but at this point her situation is so dire and her needs are so great that it would be easy for people to think of caretaking much like one would a terminal cancer patient. She may not recover but there is a chance she could. \n\nMy family (2 kids and a husband) live far away in a foreign country. I don\u0027t work. \n\nWe are here visiting for the summer and I feel the situation is critical enough to warrant me staying her for the upcoming school year. My dad is overwhelmed, and my other sister who lives nearby just had a baby but she and her husband just started new jobs as high school principals. \n\nI am in online school to get my teaching license but otherwise don\u0027t work. My older child will be in 1st grade and my younger child will be in pre-k4. \n\nI don\u0027t know how I can possibly convince my husband to let me and the kids stay behind for 9 months so he can finish his contract.

We would have to pay for pre-k for my younger child, which would take away from savings. My in-laws live in the same city and have a guest house out back, otherwise we would have no place to live which makes this plan even crazier. \n\nI know this is an unrealistic plan but it\u0027s very hard for me to be away from my parents when they are struggling like this. Am I just motivated by guilt here? Has anyone else done something like this?",

  "title": "[UPDATE] - 18 year old daughter assaulted 25 year old daughter.",
  "selftext": "Thanks for the advice on [the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/95cude/18_year_old_daughter_assaulted_25_year_old/) \n\nMy wife and I spent a lot of time discussing what we were going to do about what happened. Megan is (for the moment) staying at Sam\u0027s parents, while Melissa is being kept in the hospital because her asthma symptoms are persisting. \n\nWe eventually decided that Megan should be our priority at the moment. Some of the people on the other post seemed to think we had \u0027\u0027favouritism\u0027\u0027 towards Melissa. That isn\u0027t the case, we love them both. However, I will admit that Melissa got more attention than Megan did when they were little, simply because her medical problems were a huge worry for us. I think most people would agree that making a sick child\u0027s care your priority is not immoral. That said, it was absolutely wrong that we treated Melissa too leniently in her behaviour towards her sister. We should have made clear that her remarks about Megan\u0027s appearance and her relationship with Sam were not acceptable. If we\u0027d done that than maybe things wouldn\u0027t have gotten this far. \n\nWe went to see Melissa in hospital yesterday and told her what was going to happen. We told her that if she makes an effort to get Megan arrested, then Sam will report the unwanted kiss as sexual assault, and we would back him up. We also stated that we would not give any statement supporting her accusation against Megan. \n\nMelissa then started to sob and said we were being unfair to her, and said that we were siding with Megan and were letting Megan  get away with hurting her. \n\nWe also told her that at the moment, Megan was our priority. Melissa has a fully established career whereas Megan has only just got a job. Melissa makes enough money that she could easily get her own place if she wanted, which is why we\u0027re going to let Megan stay with Sam for two months, during which time we expect Melissa to get her stuff together and find somewhere of her own. \n\nMelissa was horrified and upset when she heard this. We tried to comfort her and told her we will help her with anything she needs. We said we\u0027d help her find a place if she wanted and that we\u0027d still be involved in her life. She was crying her eyes out at this point and said that she was being punished for getting attacked. He mother tried to soothe her and assure her that we love her, but she said that if we loved her we wouldn\u0027t be kicking her out. \n\nAt this point she was distressed and her asthma symptoms started to come back. She was breathing heavily and I called someone. Even as she was struggling and we were ushered away we could tell how heartbroken she was and it  was painful for us. \n\nWhile I think this is the best thing we can do, I\u0027m not necessarily sure it\u0027s the right thing. Melissa, while financially sound, is emotionally dependent on us and I\u0027m not sure she could cope on her own. Even so, Megan is our priority now and we have to do what\u0027s best for her, and we\u0027ve also started talking about getting her therapy if that\u0027s what she wants, and hopefully in a few years we can work towards some kind of peace between the sisters. \n\nDid we do the right thing?",

  "selftext": "To make this short I was sexually abused as a child. I don\u0027t want to get into all the details but it happened at my uncle\u0027s house. We visited him in the summer and he would tell me that I could sleep in his bed since I was older. It would get hot and he would tell me that we could strip down to our underwear. He abused me sexually until I spoke up about it. I have been in therapy on and off since then. \n\nFast forward many years later. I now have 3 boys with my ex wife. They are 14, 12, and 7. They just went back home from being with me for the summer. Cosleeping was important to my wife from the start and we slept separately. She had the boys in her room and I slept on the couch. The oldest stopped cosleeping by choice around age 6. The youngest stopped when he was 4. The middle was still cosleeping most nights when we divorced  2 years ago. \n\nAt my house he normally sleeps in shorts or his underwear. We have central cooling but he has hypohidrosis so he doesn\u0027t sweat normally. I casually mentioned that I hope he puts more clothes on when he sleeps with his mom but he said that he usually just goes to her room in his shorts or underwear. This was a huge trigger for me since that was how my uncle molested me when I was younger.  \n\nThis has been on my mind since he told me. I spoke to my ex about it and she said, \"Are you kidding? He\u0027s my son! You are making this weird.\" Am I? I feel like this shouldn\u0027t be happening at his age. ",

  "selftext": "Hello all. This is my first time positing here, so I’m sorry if I broke any rules. \n\n     I am 22 years old and my nephew is practically raised by the TV and his phone. He lives between two homes (my parents house which my brother lives at and his moms house). No one really watches him and I noticed he’s starting to get an attitude where he thinks he’s cool and mature and know it all. My brother is mover and is mostly gone all day. My dad works full time, and my mom just does her own thing.         I am working full time during the summers, and during the school year I’m away at college so I can’t really watch him. My nephew just really plays Fortnite, Call of Duty, Dying Light, and watches YouTube videos when he’s here(I have no idea what he does at his moms). He’s on the playstation so much and no one really supervises what he’s doing. \n     One day I was playing a game and messages kept popping up from my nephews account. I was annoyed and clicked on his messages to try to turn off notifications. When I looked at his messages I found pictures of boobs sent to him. I decided to scroll through this message and look at others and found him sending screenshots of porn, talking about prostitutes, and sex. He was also swearing a lot and talking about his balls. One thing that was really disturbing was that he was in a “orgy” chat that had really graphic pornographic pictures (like pictures of gaping buttholes full of “fluids”). One by one I reported the users, deleted his friends that I found inappropriate stuff on, and deleted those messages. I changed the password on the internet and banned him from using it for a week. I don’t really know what to do. I told my brother about it and he just laughed while he said that he’s going to see it anyway. It’s one thing saying he might stumble on it, but actively looking for it at such a young age worries me. I can’t set up parental controls either because I need my brothers password. I’m tempted to get rid of internet access on the PlayStation... I just don’t know how to make this a teaching moment for my nephew. I don’t know how to get him to understand why it’s wrong for him to talk about adult stuff at such a young age. I tried talking to him and he just gave me an attitude and said “he knows why he shouldn’t be looking at that.”  I’m not really sure what to do. Does anyone have any advice? \n\nTLDR: Nephew was actively engaging in “adult” chats on the PlayStation. Banned him from using the internet for now and deleted all the inappropriate content. Not sure how to make it a teaching lesson for him.",

  "selftext": "Parenting throwaway bc my main is weird.\n\nStep mom of 8 years here. I\u0027m really livid and upset right now. Heads up this will be long. \n\nOur 13 y/o boy has been showing his little brother porn. He\u0027s with us only on weekends. We\u0027ve taken away all his device access and what he can use is heavily monitored when he\u0027s with us. It hasnt been a problem in a several months. He went to grandmas with the little ones this past weekend and got his hands on a tablet. Started showing my just barely 7 y/o how to search for porn and showed him videos. 7 y/o was very upset and told.\n\nThis has been an ongoing problem. He has done this last year with my now 8 y/o. We\u0027ve been teaching sex ed since l.o. came up asking about oral sex out of the blue and found out. We cut off all device access and have been building up trust to where the eldest has been allowed to use devices closely monitored. The first chance he got...he rook it and ran with it.\n\nWe had a similar issue when eldest was around 8-10 and got caught looking for stripper and hooker videos on YouTube. At the time he said it made him feel gross. We worked with him and things got better but its become a serious issue now.\n\nI\u0027ll put it out there. I am a childhood sexual abuse survivor. I really don\u0027t take well to my 13 y/o tainting my innocent babies. I dont know how to get him help. And i want to keep them from this stuff as long as possible. Sex is great...its not a bad thing. But i really dont want their sexual ideations based on porn. Idk what - exactly - hes showing them. \n\nHe also steals and lies impulsively. I\u0027m really worried about his future but I also want to protect the little ones. \n\nHis mom doesn\u0027t take it seriously. Shes a therapist and this stuff gets shrugged off. I don\u0027t understand. \n\nWhen he recently got caught with porn there it seemed to be a big blow out. She sent him here for a week and he had no phone at her place 2-4 weeks.  Just the other day he left his phone on top of his moms car...good riddance! (He can only use it for emergencies when here). He was bragging about how sad he was aboit it because he just got YouTube and internet back. WTF!! I was shocked when this has been an issue for so long and she has been aware of it. \n\nWe don\u0027t have him often and are very poor. I want to get him in for a psych eval and therapy but idk how. With the limited time and funds as well as being a noncustodial parent. Im so worried about how this behavior will affect him growing as a teen and into young adulthood. Also, again, dont want the babes exposed to this.\n\nWe have a small house and the 3 share a room. I sleep in what used to be the living room its an open space and on the flip side of the enormous fireplace that acts as a divider is our game room. I want to take him out of the boys room and put him in the opposite room on his mattress or an air mattress for the time being while we figure out how to go forward.\n\nSo. Do I have a tiny porn addict on my hands; is that possible? How do I get him help for his implusive behaviors? Is it wrong to seperate him from them if it means lack of privacy for a pubescent teen? How can I better protect the little brothers? Ugh.\n\nIm just so frustrated and disgusted. This was not what I expected for raising 3 boys. I love them but I\u0027m not well equipped for this die to my background. My husband is going to handle the conversation for obvious reasons but Im seeking advice for the time leading up to that.\n\nThank you for your advice fellow parents!",

We did not want to be parents but we kinda had to step up to help our neice.** \n\nRecently (5 months ago) My wife and I became psudo parents to my neice. My ultra religious sister kicked my 18 year old neice out of her house for smoking weed and having sex. I called my necie to see if she was ok. She tells me she was kicked out and she was going to live with some guy.. that no one in the family knows.  I told her that you are not doing that and you are coming to live with me and your aunt. \n\nWe set some very lax rules for her. Must start college, Must have a job, easy on the weed and sex, We told her your an adult now and you can make choices, jsut try ot make good ones. \n\nTo start she did pretty good. Got a job in a few days, started summer 1 classes and made good grades, got some friends and seemed to only smoke every now and then and a hook up here and there... whatever.  Untill one night her friends brought her back to our house.. fucking rolling / triping out hard. She was screaming and crying rolling on the floor about being raped. First we thought shit she got raped call the cops and then she started wildy accusing about every man we / she knows saying they all raped her (her dad, grandfather, guys at works if you were a guy you raped her it seems).   I question her friends they \"do not know anything\". Yah right I tell them to ge the fuck out and never come back.  My wife sits with her for HOURS while she is freaking out making sure she does not die or anything.  The next day she come around and does not remember anything at all.  Says she just drak some beer.. bullshit.\n\nWe talk to her and set more rules. No drugs, no more shit friends, go to work and school home, on the weekends come home early.  At this point my wife wants to track her phone with one of them parent spy apps. I did not want to but I eventually agree.\n\nWe are now horrified at what we have found out over the last few weeks.\n\n**- Googles suscide help lines**\n\n\\- Asking people for money for drugs\n\n\\- Skiping school or soem classes almost every other day\n\n**- Lies to her friends about her family and us for no reason**\n\n**- Doing LSD** \n\n**- Trying to find fucking DMT**\n\n\\- She fucks at least 5 or 6 guys a week\n\n\\- Think she might be fucking for money / drugs\n\nWhat the fuck do we do? I dont want to tell her hey we spied on you and saw how fucked up you are. We want to help her but do not even know where the fuck to start. \n\nHelp\n\n\\-Lost",

  "selftext": "[Ca, NV] At the time I got pregnant, I lived in Nevada. Before I found out I was pregnant I moved back to California, and my ex and I split. He is still in Nevada. He would admit to me that our baby was his but no one else knew. He’s been sending me money for her since she was born however now his very wealthy fiancé (who he was cheating on me with without me finding out and didn’t even know him and I were together) wants the baby and wants to take me to court. \n\nMy ex has an over ten year old case of domestic violence that was dropped. I also have screenshots of us talking about how at one point he sexually assaulted me when we were together and he countered with “I can rape him any time I want”. \n\nI currently do not have a job, and I am on Medi-Cal and welfare. I do have a history of bipolar disorder, however, since having my baby, I’ve been clear minded. I haven’t needed any medication. \n\nWhat are the chances I’ll be able to keep my baby if he’s sent money, but she’s lived with me this whole time and he didn’t help or come see me when pregnant? When he hasn’t even seen her in person? And is that an admission of guilt that he assaulted me and could I use that in court? \n\nI really don’t want to lose her as she is my world and there’s no way I could visit her if he gets custody.

  "selftext": "My 4yo has been taught her whole life about bodily autonomy and consent. She knows that she never has to kiss or hug anyone she doesn\u0027t want to, or be touched in any way she doesn\u0027t like, ever. We also try to teach her to respect others\u0027 bodily autonomy and seek their consent.  \n\nShe is also very needy when it comes to physical affection. She is almost 5 and is just now starting to sleep on her own. It has been a very difficult process and she still wants/needs to be cuddled to sleep every night. She also demands a lot of snuggle time throughout the day and night. Not only is it often inconvenient or impossible for someone to cuddle with her the second she asks for it, it worries me both that she is reliant on the physical contact which will not always be available to her (she starts kindergarten in the fall) and that she is not respectful of other people\u0027s bodies.  \n\nIs it harmful to a child to deny them physical affection in a particular instance? She is not touch-starved overall, she gets at least a cumulative hour or two of cuddle time daily. ",

  "title": "11 year old is starting to inherit his mother\u0027s anger issues",
  "selftext": "I\u0027m a single dad and divorced my ex wife five years ago. One of the irreconcilable differences between us was her temper. If she gets a little upset about something, she loves to throw a scene and blame everyone. She would hate when I would stay calm and try to talk it out with her before leaving with one or both of our sons (Now 11 and 6). She admitted once that she wanted me to scream back at her from some instinctual need for negative attention I\u0027m guessing.\n\nShe and her boyfriends use the boys as verbal punching bags every other weekend, and her current boyfriend uses corporal punishment. This has been documented with CPS, but all they did was recommend her to counseling, which hasn\u0027t done squat.\n\nMy 6 year old isn\u0027t affected much by all this, but my 11 year old comes back upset every time. And he\u0027s showing the same kind of anger issues my ex wife has where he just wants to fight about something. I was told they would be back home on Monday at 6. Instead, they came back on Monday at 10 without calling me, and I was a horrible person for not answering the door while I was working when he has a spare key. I was asking him if it\u0027s fair to be so mad at me after going over the circumstances, and he admitted it wasn\u0027t but still wanted to be angry at me for something. He was yelling at our mom and crying earlier there, and now he wants to push me around and hide when I ask if he wants to talk about anything. I don\u0027t think I can chalk this up to puberty since I haven\u0027t seen any physical signs in him yet. He\u0027s not like this except for right after he comes home from his mom\u0027s, and then he\u0027s fine for the next two weeks. What I don\u0027t want is for his attitude to start lingering. I don\u0027t want a mini ex wife here starting fights with me for attention. I tell them I love them and hug them daily, and I teach them calm ways to resolve problems. But he still prefers the toxic way his mom behaves that makes him upset when it\u0027s directed at him.",

  "title": "UPDATE: M 13 y/o is upset with me for being pregnant, her friend submitted pictures of my husband to a \"hot guys\" instagram page, and we got into an argument with her friend\u0027s parents",
  "selftext": "Well this is going to be a long and interesting update. We talked to her about my pregnancy, and turns out part of the reason she was so angry was the way some of her friends talked about my husband. But the the innocent crushes they had on him were actually a bigger deal than we thought, and we ended up in arguments with one of the girls parents.\n\n[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/8urjgd/my_13_year_old_daughter_is_upset_that_im_pregnant/) is a link to my original post, for the background on this.\n\n**About her reaction to my pregnancy:** Last night after we put our younger 2 to bed, our 13 year old went to her room, and shut her door. Around 9:30, while we were binge watching Netflix, she came out and sat between us, we talked about what we needed to do the next day. She said said she didn\u0027t want to go, she wanted to stay home with us. I asked her if she wanted to go, but have her dad take her around instead of me, and she said no, looked at him and said \"No, I\u0027m kinda of annoyed with you too, I know mom didn\u0027t get herself pregnant\". So we told her we respect her decision to not go to gymnastics practice, and she can stay home, but her sisters still needed to go to their activities. She gave me the saddest look and started crying, and said she really wanted us to herself, we told her we can, I texted some friends and made arrangements for the girls to go with them tomorrow. She didn\u0027t want to talk with us then, but we let her stay up with us, she fell asleep on her dad (which hasn\u0027t happened in years), then he carried her to her bed\n\nThis morning after I got our 2 youngest ready and out the door, I surprised her with her favorite breakfast, and when she was done, we sat her down and asked her how she was feeling. She started crying and said everything is going to change and that \"dad is always gone, he\u0027s always busy, \\[youngest sister\\] is always with him, I\u0027m never going to see him now\". So he gave her a big hug, told her he loved her, and that he\u0027s going to spend more time with her. I reminded her I\u0027ll be a SAHM in less than 2 weeks, so she\u0027ll have more of my attention too, but she said we already spend more time together. She\u0027s also worried I won\u0027t be able to always go to competitions and games with her if I\u0027m on bed rest like I was with my last 2 pregnancies, and when the baby gets here, I\u0027ll have to stay home with it until he/she is older.  I told her if I\u0027m on bed rest, I\u0027m really sorry, and I\u0027m going to try my best to come to all her games/competitions. We also discussed how I\u0027m going to be the mom, and I don\u0027t expect her to change diapers, feed the baby, get up with him/her, etc. because it\u0027s my job, not hers. She said sometimes she\u0027s okay with doing it, and I told her thank you, but she should never feel obligated to do it. She\u0027s also worried that we won\u0027t be able to afford sports or gymnastics anymore, and we reassured her that we had the money.\n\nLastly, she said the worst part is it embarrasses her that it\u0027s now obvious that my husband and I are intimate with each other, and she said now her friends will know too, and some of them are going to say sexual stuff about him. She\u0027s also grossed out thinking about the baby because she knows how they\u0027re made and she doesn\u0027t want to think about that. Then she asked me to find her someone to talk to again, and we told her we love her and we\u0027re so proud of her for opening up about this, so we decided to give her her phone back a day early. We also promised her this is going to be the last baby, and and she was very relieved to hear that, but asked him to get snipped, which we already have plans for. \n\n**About her friend\u0027s crushes on her dad/violence towards them:** My husband asked her about how she felt about her friends liking him, and she said it was genuinely funny at first because hes \"old and \\[she doesn\u0027t\\] understand what they see in him\", but over the past few months, it\u0027s gotten more crude, and recently a few of them have said pretty graphic things, but she didn\u0027t want to tell me at the time because she was worried I\u0027d be jealous. However, she was angry about the baby, so when they were talking about guys they like and some of her friends started talking about my husband again, it made her really mad. Then when her best friend went to go say hi when he was picking up the girls, she just wanted to stop her from getting near her dad. I told her I appreciate that she was worried about me, but I\u0027m not jealous of them, and I love that she loves and cares about her dad so much. But it\u0027s not okay to put your hands on another person, especially in anger. She agreed, and said she was just feeling really overwhelmed.\n\nSo I asked her about the incident the next day, and she said her and her friends were talking about guys from school and sexual things they\u0027d like with them, but one not close friend mentioned my husband, and how she thinks his arms and quarter sleeve tattoos are hot and wants to touch them. Another girl agreed, then said something sexual she\u0027d like to do to him. She started glaring at the girl, so she asked her if she was okay, and in return, she jumped up, pushed her over, and started yelling at her. She said she knew it was wrong, but she was mad they would talk about her dad that way. I agreed with her, but told her that they really shouldn\u0027t talk about any guy like that, even the boys at school, and explained to her what sexual objectification is. But I remember what it was like being a teenage girl, so I\u0027d like her to just tone the conversations about it down a bit when they do talk about it. She said she\u0027ll work it on and try to change the subject if they start talking about it, and we thanked her.\n\nI had 4 sets of parents call me about my daughter pushing her friend over at day camp, 2 just wanted phone calls, so we asked her to go to her room, and we called them. One set apologized profusely, and said they had a talk with their daughter about boundaries, and how inappropriate it is to talk about him, or any guy, that way, but especially your friend\u0027s married dad. Their daughter even asked to talk to our daughter, and she apologized.\n\nThe other phone call was insane. They also had the same talk with their daughter, but they went through her phone and social media.... and she\u0027s in a lot of trouble. Why? Turns out she has a few pictures of guys she likes from school on her phone, but she has *dozens* of pictures of my husband that she took: some in his uniform while he was at the middle school with our daughter, shirtless cutting our grass, in the pool with our younger 2 girls, cooking in the kitchen, cleaning the pool, me and him from behind with his arm around me, etc. She also submitted some of them and some pictures from his Instagram/Facebook to an Instagram page that has over 250,000 followers about hot guys. They sent me the link to it, and yep, it\u0027s a picture she took of him shirtless in our backyard standing next to the pool, a video he put on Instagram of him working out, a shirtless selfie he took after working out, and a picture of me and him at the beach, but he\u0027s wearing a speedo (she blurred out my face, but the rest of the picture was cut off, it shows other Marines he works with all wearing them to annoy their Gunnery Sergeant, it was a joke), and it had thousands of likes and comments. Some people just commented how hot he is, others were really sexual, and a few were terrible comments about my body. So I messaged whoever runs the page they quickly responded and deleted it the post. This honestly pissed both of us off, we understand the girl is 15, but we felt violated. Because of all this, her parents agreed she shouldn\u0027t come over at all for now, but said we didn\u0027t do anything wrong, and they don\u0027t want to to ruin the girl\u0027s friendship, so they can still see each other at gymnastics, hang out away from our house, and school this fall. We told our daughter, and she said she was done with her, and although we didn\u0027t show her the post or pictures she took, she was really grossed out by the idea of it, and said she didn\u0027t want to hang out with someone who would do that to her dad and I. So now gymnastic practice is going to be a little awkward, but she said she can handle it.\n\nThe other 2 sets of parents came over, and we\u0027re friendly with one set, and have an interesting history with the wife of the other one (they lived across the street from us on base, and she would sit on the porch and watch my husband cut the grass, asked for help moving heavy boxes while her husband was gone, then answers the door wearing a bikini, along with a history of sexual comments about him). The friendly ones had no idea my husband our daughter\u0027s biological father, he does look younger, like he\u0027s in his early 20s, so they assumed he was her step dad, not that it makes the situation much better, but they now definitely understand why she was so upset. They brought over a case a beer for my husband and brownies for me and apologized, and said they had a talk with their daughter about it. \n\nThe other set of parents flipped out. They blamed us, the wife called my husband a \"Scandinavian predator\" (he\u0027s half Norwegian, I\u0027m not sure if she knew that, but I\u0027m guessing it was a reference to him being 6\u00272\" with blue eyes) and said he must have been asking for everything, because he sometimes goes running without a shirt and he walks around without a shirt on outside a lot, and he was tempting the girls by wearing shirts that show off his muscles (He doesn\u0027t show them off, that\u0027s just how shirts fit when you\u0027re muscular). He was surprisingly calm during this, because he knows she\u0027s a little crazy, but then her husband got into his face, and started cussing and said he got me pregnant when I was 15, so he must have a thing for teenage girls. Never mind the fact that he was also 15 at the time, he was kid too. So my husband started yelling back, the husband from the first set of parents stepped in between them and pushed them apart and threatened to call the cops of the crazy couple, and said the should probably leave. They yelled some more while walking out saying they\u0027re going to tell everyone and left. The couple we\u0027re friendly with said they know he\u0027s not a predator, and the wife is also a Marine and knows some of my husband\u0027s female coworkers- apparently even they were talking about him when we first PCS\u0027d here, and said she see\u0027s the look in their eyes when they talk about him, so if grown women are going to react that way, than to quote her \"Look at you! Of course hormonal teenage girls are going want a piece of that\", haha. Thankfully, most people here know that the crazy woman is obsessed with drama, so they\u0027re not going to believe a word that comes out of her mouth.\n\nOnce everyone left, my husband went upstairs to apologize for the yelling, and said everyone was gone, so they could spend some time together. He then let her decide what she wanted to do, and she decided she wanted to go get Sweet Frog and then go see Incredibles 2. While getting ready, she asked when we were going to tell her sisters that I\u0027m pregnant, and we told her she could help decide when and how we tell them- she got excited about that. They\u0027re at the movies right now, but he sent me pictures of her smiling and laughing while eating frozen yogurt, and I\u0027m happy she\u0027s smiling again. I really appreciate the advice everyone gave me in my last post, it was very helpful. I feel like I\u0027m getting my sweet girl back. :)\n\n**TL/DR: We sat our daughter down and had a really good talk with her. She opened up a lot, said it grosses her out that I\u0027m pregnant, and she\u0027s worried about change, and she\u0027s worried her dad won\u0027t be able to spend as much time with her. We talked through her feelings, but we still have some work to do, so I\u0027m making her an appointment with a counselor on Monday. Regarding our daughter\u0027s friend\u0027s crushes on her dad, it took an unexpected turn, turns out one of the was a tad bit obsessed with him, she posted pictures of him online,and our daughter decided not to be friends with her anymore. We also got into an argument with one of the girl\u0027s parents. My husband and daughter are at the movie\u0027s right now, and she seems a lot happier.**",

  "selftext": "Yesterday my 9 (almost 10)  y/o son was playing in his room with a 9 y/o girl, his best friend and neighbor. I overheard her saying \"this is where the pee comes out and this is where the baby comes out\". Peeking through the cracked in the closed door I could see (a reflection in the mirror) that she was lying on her back, her panties down, and a light placed to shine on her.\n\nI knocked on the door and called them (it was time for snacks). Later, after his friend went home, I talked to him. It seems that this wasn\u0027t the first time they had sex play. He said that they were playing doctor and nurse. (Her mother is a nurse), and she had \"examined\" his private parts. She told him that he had both of his \"tetacles\" and that his penis was ok.\n\nI told him that his private parts were private and were not to be seen by others, particularly by girls and women other than his mother. He replied that he knew that, and that was why the door was closed. And that his friend was going to be a nurse and was examining him like a nurse would. He said that he would never show his private parts to others and that this was different because she was going to be a nurse and was learning and teaching him. \n\nHis father is out of town for work. I talked to him by phone; he didn\u0027t seem too concerned. It is up to me to handle it. Should I complain to the girl\u0027s mother?\n\nMy son also told me that the girl said that her older sister bled from the \"baby hole\" every month and that was normal, but that any other bleeding could be a problem. My son does know the \"facts of life\", but I haven\u0027t told him about menstruation because a 9 y/o boy doesn\u0027t need to know about that.\n\nMy son is very interested in science, particularly biology. But I think that this is going way too far. I don\u0027t like the idea of children engaging in sex play. What should I do? Should I complain to the girl\u0027s mom? (a friend of mine)? What effect does seeing a girl\u0027s private parts have on a young boy? Does he need therapy or any sort of counseling? How should I handle it?",

One day i hope to be at peace\n\nWe met originally when I was 15. He paid so much attention to me. He told me how mature i was, how I wasnt like other girls. He told me he wanted to take my virginity so it would be even more special for the both of us. My parents never monitored my online activity and that\u0027s how I fell into the hands of a predator. What 32 year old man would be actually interested in a 15 year old other than to groom them and be manipulative and downright creep.\n\nWe met for the first time 3 weeks after my 18th birthday. We had sex. He got what he wanted. He kept pushing me more and more to do things I didn\u0027t want to but I was a timid and meek person, still am. I didn\u0027t know how to say \"no\" . we kept meeting up once a month for a year. Then my dad passed away and it completely fucked my entire world up. He swooped in, swept me off my feet. He promised to take care of me in my grief. My mom moved in with her sister and there was no room for me so to him I went. So many red flags i missed.\n\nThe abuse didn\u0027t start until a few months later. At first it was little things. I did sometbing to upset him and he couldn\u0027t control his anger but he promised to never do it again. Then he broke my laptop. Then he demanded I cut contact with my mom. At the time i was angry and hurt and did everything he said. I truely believed he loved me and this was normal. I had necer been in a relationship before this so I really thought this waa okay. That this was his way of showing me \"love\"\n\nHe\u0027s never allow3d me to have a job. No money of my own. He has to review everything I need for myself. He has to deem them acceptable. He decided what tampons I bought, what clothes I bought, what groceries we needed. Everything has to go through him first. He still talks down to me like a child and belittles and insults me because he has two degrees and i only managed to graduate high school.\n\nThen we had our child. He was so angry fir my water breaking in the car and messing up his seat. He wasn\u0027t there for her birth. He was furious that i had a c-section and we couldn\u0027t havr the disgusting sex he likes so much sooner than he wanted. Instead of letting me heal after giving birth, our daughter was 4 weeos old when he raped me analy and I still have issues almost 2 yyears later. He refused to let me breastfeed because hebdidnt want my \u0027tits to get fucked up\u0027. He would get angry and scream at me when she needed diapers or formula anf accuse me of taking advantage ofhim and trapping him. Nevermind the faxt a 32 year old was chasing after a 15 year old when we first \u0027met\u0027 6 years ago\n\nThr worst incident is when his own father did something to piss him off so he took it out on me. He pinned me against the wall and choked me so hard I stsrted to lose my sight. In thought i was going to die that night and accepted as much. A small part of me wished he had just killed me. part of me is terrified to peave because i have a feelijv he will kill me for leaving with our daughter. But ive had enough. I cannot do this anymore\n\nBut what he. Doesnt know is i have an old cell phone that stillnworks over Wi-Fi. That im back in contact with my mom who is tryung to help us leave. That shr sends me money every month so I can get us away from him. Its never much, 10or 20 dollars a month but I will one day have enough to leave him. I want to change our names do he can never find us. I don\u0027t want my daughter to know this is her father\n\nIn so glad I never married him. He claims hr will never marry me because I\u0027m too much of a mooch and drag on his lifestyle. He has told me he wants to fuck ogher girls and I should consider myself lucky he hasn\u0027t yet. He says he hates me and the feeling is so very mutual. I despise him. I resent him. I hate the fact this is the man my child shares half of her dna with. I know I am a horrible person fof this but sometimes I wish he would drop dead. I hope I am able to get us out before shr can remember him bruising mommy\u0027s throat and yelling and throwing and breaking things.\n\nOne day I will leave him. One day he won\u0027t have control over me anymore. One Day",

  "title": "How do you handle sleepovers when your kids aren\u0027t the same sex but have the same friends?",
  "selftext": "I thought I would add some additional information down below. \n\nI have three kids. Younger two are 11 and 9. The 11 year old is a boy and the 9 year old is a girl. They are very close. My daughter is more of a tomboy and likes to hang out with her brother and his friends. They all get along. The boys are mostly neighborhood boys or friends from sports/school. They are between ages 9 and 12.  \n\nI\u0027m not sure how we should be handling sleepovers. My daughter usually hangs out with them during their pre sleepover activities but what should we do about bedtime? Our living room is used as a game room for the kids and that\u0027s usually where they sleep when they have sleepovers. There is no door and the room opens to the foyer. I can see what\u0027s going on in the room from the upstairs hallway. I do check up on them through the night before I go to sleep.\n\nMy ex husband (kids father) expressed concerns about this recently and doesn\u0027t think it\u0027s appropriate for her to be in the same room as the boys. This came up because my daughter was upset that she wasn\u0027t allowed to go to a sleepover because she was a girl and the rest of the kids were boys. She didn\u0027t think that was fair because she has sleepovers with the boys here and that\u0027s when her dad lost it. He knew that our son had sleepovers here but didn\u0027t know our daughter was in the same room. I didn\u0027t think I had to tell him because I didn\u0027t see the big deal. My husband doesn\u0027t see the problem either. \n\nAm I wrong? Our kids are pre pubescent. Is it really a big deal for them to share an open room when they have sleepovers? What should I do instead? During sleepovers they stay up later than I do. I suspect my daughter would just escape downstairs at some point in the middle of the night. She hangs out with them all day anyway and since they are allowed to go ride bikes and everything by themselves, they are usually without supervision. At least in the house they are somewhat supervised. Moreso than when they are playing in the woods. What does everyone else think about this? ",

  "selftext": "So yesterday I found out my wife is pregnant. We were NOT planning this. We have 2 sons, ages 4 and 1. Both had to be conceived with fertility treatments. I was told it was impossible to get my wife pregnant on my own.....well apparently not. Any support or advice from folks who have been in this position would be appreciated. I\u0027m scared, wracked with guilt over not wanting a 3rd child, and have even had thoughts of asking my wife to put it up for adoption....I know that\u0027s terrible. But this was not in our plans. We\u0027re financially stable enough to support a 3rd child which is good. But to go through the baby phase again, at 39 (age I\u0027ll be when he/she is born) and 35 (my wife\u0027s age)....I\u0027m shuddering at the thought. Maybe bc our 2nd has been so tough. He\u0027s a year old and still not sleeping all night. But he\u0027s finally off the breast, and we\u0027ve put away all the baby items or given them to family. I\u0027m just at a loss here. I know it\u0027s a blessing (or supposed to be) but I\u0027m not feeling it at all. I want to cry in fact. Because of the boys our romantic life was so diminished we\u0027ve only been \"intimate\" twice this past year....obviously the odds of this happening are long. Maybe I should play the lotto, lol. I\u0027m a man of faith and believe this is somehow in God\u0027s plan but I\u0027m really questioning it right now. \nTL:DR- Oops baby, not planned for, advice from anyone who has been there is appreciated",

I\u0027ve got a career, I\u0027ve been a massage therapist for 6 years. I\u0027ve had my own apartment, I\u0027ve been in serious relationships before this one, and I\u0027ve never truly felt balanced. This week some things in my life have helped me to re-evaluate what it actually takes to be an adult, and get the shit done that\u0027s required in order to live in this world. So, here\u0027s my list that I\u0027m working on. I want to know if this list is complete, and if not, what\u0027s missing? A month ago I wouldn\u0027t have added nearly as much, but this stuff is important in order to function and it\u0027s more than I thought.\n\nSex life\n\nRomantic relationship\n\nFamily ties\n\nFriendships\n\nBills\n\nCareer\n\nDebt\n\nHome ownership or rental\n\nHousehold chores\n\nSelf care (i.e. feeding self, sleeping, the basics)\n\nHygiene \n\nChildren activities\n\nChildren relationships \n\nCar ownership or rental\n\nPublic licenses\n\nPet health\n\nExercise \n\nCommunity involvement \n\nPolitical awareness\n\nSelf education \n\nHave I missed any? And these are things I\u0027m trying to balance EVERY day. God damn it, it\u0027s hard. How do people manage their time? It feels like everyone else is so much more balanced, and I\u0027m sure everyone has difficulties balancing, but....how do you fit all this shit into one day? One week? Hell, even a month is hard to address every one of these things. ",

  "title": "My Family Is in Crisis",
  "selftext": "(Throwaway account because I don\u0027t want my son finding this post)\n\nMy family is in crisis because of my 17 year old son. Ever since he turned 15 it\u0027s been a downhill battle with him. It started with back talking and his so-called \"emo\" self-expression but by the time he hit his junior year it had escalated to weekly meltdowns, fights, and direct defiance. Now it has gotten so unbearable that my wife and I are giving up. We refuse to keep rehashing the same fights with him day after day, week after week. We are exhausted.\n\nMy son used to be a bright kid, who was always eager to please. As a child he respected our authority and was grateful for our help and guidance. Although at times he was unsure of himself, we as his parents pushed him to do what we knew was right for him. With our help he got into the advanced learners program in his elementary school, got into accelerated math in his middle school, and was competitive in tennis and basketball. He was on track to do great things with his life. My wife and I always envisioned him as an engineer because of his incredible aptitude for math and science.\n\nHowever, everything came crashing down in the middle of sophomore year. When we found out he was hanging around with \"emo\" kids who weren\u0027t quite to our liking, we immediately took away all electronics and privileges indefinitely, and made it clear we did not approve of his choice in friends. While this may seem like a harsh reaction, we were simply trying to protect him from bad influences. As we went through his phone we saw that many of these kids were extremely psychologically disturbed and were encouraging our son to \"live in the moment\" and \"go out\" more, which, given the context of these conversations, I assume were code-words for doing drugs. I refused to allow my son to make those kinds of choices.\n\nIn reaction to this our son became moody, withdrawn, and lost all respect for authority. Some nights he\u0027d go out without our permission, and wouldn\u0027t come home till 11 or midnight. Other nights he\u0027d lock himself in his room and refuse to engage with the rest of the family. On multiple occasions we confronted him about his behavior and let him know that if he did not respect our rules, there would be consequences. The only response we would get was a dismissive eye roll and slammed door.\n\nThis continued until he began his junior year, when all hell broke loose. I\u0027m not sure of the details but my son clashed with the emo group and began hanging out with true degenerates, who got him into smoking pot. He became secretive and confrontational with me and my wife, and seemed to be looking for excuses to fight with us. By some miracle his grades didn\u0027t suffer, but it seemed like every week we were getting calls home from the guidance counselor about concerning or antisocial behavior. Every time we confronted him about this it ended in a screaming match. All of this mounting tension boiled over when our son attempted suicide halfway through the school year.\n\nThis may sound harsh, but when I sat in the hospital room with my son, all I felt was disgust and anger. To this day I believe he tried to kill himself as an act of defiance. He wasn\u0027t \"depressed,\" he just wanted to get back at us for some perceived injustice. It was in the hospital room that we discovered he had been mutilating himself on his stomach. When we saw the scars I wanted to vomit. It was vile, that he would disrespect not only himself but us as his parents in such a manner. He also admitted he believed he was homosexual and had been messaging older men online. It disgusted me. My wife had to leave the room because it was too much for her.\n\nWhen we brought him home we made it clear he would still have to face the consequences of his actions, but he became hysterical and insisted that \"you\u0027re never gonna change.\" After this he refused to communicate with us, but we forced the issue especially with regards to his college applications. He says he doesn\u0027t want us involved in his application process, and just last month we found out he\u0027s been working on his essay without us. Under normal circumstances we would want him to do some independent work on his application, but given his current state it enrages me that he won\u0027t accept our help. We know what\u0027s best for him and my wife and I have a good idea of what schools he should go to, but at this point it seems like he\u0027s going to throw his whole future away because of his pointless rebellion.\n\nMy wife and I are at a loss. Our son has one year left in our house and then he\u0027s off to college. God knows what he\u0027ll get up to then. How do we avoid confrontation with our son and help him with his application process? How do we get him back on the right path? We\u0027ve tried all types of punishment but nothing is getting through to him. We just want our obedient little boy back.",

  "title": "How do you answer questions about relationships/marriage?",
  "selftext": "My 4 year-old son has started asking a lot of questions about marriage, who he can marry, what it’s all about etc\n\nToday he asked me “why can’t boys marry boys, dad?” and I instinctively replied that boys can marry boys, if that’s what they both want. He just went “oh okay” and went back to playing. \n\nI sat there afterwards thinking if I’d handled it the right way, should you encourage your children to be attracted to the opposite sex? It’s a tough one, there’s a lot to take in to consideration, like boys normally make friends with yer boys and girls with other girls, so by saying you can marry the same sex, do they then grow up thinking they’re supposed to marry a friend? \n\nI’m sorry if I’m not making any sense, it’s been a hectic day! He’s being very clingy with me at the moment, freaks whenever I go to the toilet etc, I understand why he’s being like this though and I’m on top of it, it’s just exhausting. \n\nAlso I hope I don’t come off as ignorant towards people, I’m generally an open minded person and have nothing against anyone, regardless of sexuality, race etc. \n\nThanks.

  "title": "My son is scared to sleep alone - looking for advice",
  "selftext": "I\u0027ll start off by saying I know we screwed up, and this will probably be solved by ripping the band-aid off, but I\u0027m looking for anyone who has gone through a similar experience.  Like I said, I know we screwed up, but there are reasons for what happened.  My wife or I have been sleeping in our son\u0027s room at night for years now.  Started at 3, and he\u0027s now 9.  I\u0027m finally done with grad school, its summer break, so this mess is ending now.  But how to go about doing it?\n\nMy son had absolutely awful reflux when he was born.  Spit up all the time, screamed - not cried, SCREAMED - from about 6-7pm until 1-2am for the first 3-4 months of his life.  My wife and I were utterly shell-shocked.  We still look back in horror about those days even now.  It was a fucking nightmare.  Lots of talks with pediatrician, finally got on Zantac around 3 months in and it slowly started helping.  So the long stretch of non-stop screaming ended.  But putting him to bed was still like trying to put down an unstable bomb.  The slightest sound or creak would wake him and he\u0027d cry and cry and cry.  Letting him cry it out never worked, because he never stopped.  He\u0027d cry until he threw up everywhere, then cry more.  Getting him into bed at night became an art for me, my wife and my mom.  But we got good at it eventually.\n\nAs he got older other problems arose.  The little booger is an excellent climber and was escaping his crib before he could walk.  We eventually had to lower the mattress to the floor so he couldn\u0027t scale it anymore.  When we moved him to a toddler bed...well, there was nothing holding him back.  He\u0027s just get up and get out, following us and either laughing or crying.  It would take a concerted effort for 1-3 hours every damn night to get him to stay in bed.  My wife joked that this was my fault because I never want to go to bed.  You have to find the laughs somewhere.\n\nOur biggest mistake came when he was 3 and got a stomach bug that last for days.  Poor kid had constant issues with reflux to begin with, but this was a LOT of freaking vomit.  We were up all night for several nights.  Got really concerned about him getting dehydrated.  Finally one very sleep deprived night we took him to our bed.  He got better in a couple of days, but we made a new discovery - in our bed he went right to sleep!  No more evenings spent fighting for hours!  We faked going to bed and got up to party!  It was WONDERFUL!  No more exhausted evenings full of fighting!  Movies, games, sex all over the house!  What a time to be alive!\n\nAfter about a year of this we knew we should probably get him back to his room, but he didn\u0027t want to.  We kept telling ourselves, next summer, next time we have vacation, next blah blah blah.  When he was 5 he wanted a bunk bed, so we got him one on the condition he went back to his room.  Well, fate intervened to keep him away from his bed longer.  To try and speed this up, there were some scumbags renting the house diagonally across from our house and his bedroom.  One night there was a shootout from all the criminals in that house.  Every surrounding house was filled with bullets except ours.  Luckily no one was hurt, but there was no fucking way he was going to go back to his room now!  Our community and the city government worked together to get those fuckers kicked out/arrested (they were renting), and we moved our son back to his room.  But he wouldn\u0027t go, not alone.  So I went with him.  \n\nThat was three years ago roughly.  At times I\u0027ve been in there, at other times my wife is in there.  Usually she is so tired from work that she goes to bed at the same time he does.  In this time I completed grad school to become a NP, and we\u0027ve had a little girl.  She\u0027s 2 now and everything about her sleeping has been easy as possible thank God.  We\u0027re expecting massive push back from him, which is why we didn\u0027t do it while I was in school.  Too much damn homework every night.  He\u0027s absolutely terrified of being alone at night.  He doesn\u0027t care if his sister sleeps alone, or if his friends do.  There is no shaming him out of this.  He wakes up every morning all alone in his room after one of us has left and that doesn\u0027t bother him.  It\u0027s the whole process of going to bed...just like it always has been with him.\n\nHe has stuffed animals, lucky stuffed animals, a Minecraft torch night light, other night lights that go out after an hour or two.  He\u0027s still scared unless we\u0027re with him.  We live in an extremely quiet, safe neighborhood (minus the jerks from years ago that he doesn\u0027t even know about).  He doesn\u0027t watch scary movies or play bad games.  I know this is all our faults but I\u0027m here looking for ideas.  Have any of you experienced something similar, and how did you solve it?\n\nThanks",

  "title": "Someone with a SEVERE herpes outbreak kissed my baby all over his precious little face!!! 😭😡😫",
  "selftext": "I was trying to get a photo of a baby bird in my neighbors’ yard who looked too young to fledge to send to a friend who rehabs birds, and the wife offered to hold my 8 week old baby for a minute. She’s a good friend and I’ve known her for years, so I was fine with it. I noticed she had a bad injury (or what I thought was an injury) all over her chin, side of her mouth, and cheek. It looked like it was from a fall, like road rash that reached down to the bottom of her chin.\n\nIt honestly didn’t occur to me that it could be something contagious until I looked over and noticed her kissing my baby right on the side of his mouth and cheeks, rubbing her wound all over his beautiful face. I didn’t even think to ask her not to kiss him before I handed him over, taking it for granted that nobody would be that reckless and stupid with a friend’s innocent, little baby.\n\nI hurried over and tried to ask as unassuming and discretely as possible how she hurt her face, if she fell or something. She nonchalantly explain that it was “JUST” herpes, it was just simplex 2, the more severe form, which is why it had taken over the lower half of her face.\n\nMy heart just sank. I’ve always been terrified of herpes, like, phobia-level terrified. It’s one of my worst fears. Not only that, but babies are far more susceptible to transmission due to their immature immune systems, and worst of all, it is DEADLY to newborns. Herpes simplex 1, the more common type is dangerous enough, but simplex 2 is FAR more severe. Herpes infections in babies and toddlers can cause brain damage, encephalitis, cerebral palsy, meningitis, permanent disfiguring facial and bodily scarring, loss of vision and even limbs, not to mention DEATH!\n\nI absolutely panicked. I swiftly snatched him away from her just as she was going in for ANOTHER kiss, making up some excuse to rush off with him. I immediately washed his face, then gave him a thorough bath. My dad and I took him to the ER right away to see if they would give him antivirals, but they said that since she didn’t kiss him directly on the mouth, they wouldn’t give him anything because antivirals are apparently dangerous in themselves for babies this young. They said he would need to have an opening in his skin, a cut on the mouth or something like that in order to transmit the virus, but to watch him closely for any signs of infection, like sores, fever, lethargy, and loss of appetite. The incubation period is anywhere from 2-12 days, so that means I have 12 days of anxiety to look forward to.\n\nPlease, moms and dads, before you hand your babies over to new people, be sure to ask them NOT to kiss them under any circumstances. They don’t even need a sore or signs of an active infection to spread the virus. Some estimates put the rate of herpes in the adult population up to 80% or so, and it just isn’t worth the risk. I learned the hard way not to trust someone with a terrible contagious disease not to kiss my baby. 😭",

  "title": "How can I protect my boys\u0027 self esteem when their mom is a narcissist?",
  "selftext": "I\u0027m a single dad of two boys. One is 4 (my bio son), and the other is 8 (He was adopted at age 2 when I married his mother, and he has never met his bio dad).  \n\n\nI got a divorce with my wife last year due to her selfish attitude and lack of interest in parenting her sons. She is an attorney and would always come home too stressed from her job to function or treat anyone in a respectful way. She\u0027s had more tantrums since our four year old was born than he has.  \n\n\nI\u0027m positive my ex-wife is a narcissist. I know that is a loaded term, and I\u0027m not a doctor. But I did find a list of traits of narcissistic spouses, and she fits almost all of them with her controlling and insulting behavior. She\u0027s not all bad. She has plenty of nice days when has a good attitude, and she can act like a loving mother to the boys. But the good days don\u0027t outweigh the bad in my opinion.  \n\n\nPer the custody agreement, she sees the boys every other weekend. They always come home reporting that she was mean to them, and her excuse is that she\u0027s stressed out, and the boys should realize that she\u0027s not perfect as nobody is. She refuses to let the boys draw pictures, sing, read any books she hasn\u0027t pre-approved (ie none at all), touch her things, or play with toys in any way other than exactly what the instructions on the box say. She\u0027s very anal about her rules, and she thinks that if only she had a girl instead, she wouldn\u0027t have to yell to get compliance. Our 8 year old tells her stories she doesn\u0027t want to hear, and she repeats them on the phone to mock him. He knows exactly what she\u0027s doing even if he doesn\u0027t know how to put her passive-aggressive behavior into words to tell me, and it makes him sad.  \n\n\nThey always come home wearing the same dirty clothes they had on when they left, even if our 4 year old had a little accident or left a skid mark. Her shower is for girls only, because boys will make it dirty. She puts up a scene about how she doesn\u0027t like them using her toilet or bathroom sink either. She wants them to hold it and go in a public restroom when they go out because she hates cleaning up after boys. She makes our 4 year old wear a diaper to bed when he\u0027s been dry at night for a year and a half. Both boys must sleep on the same bed with a plastic tarp over it just in case. She was never this OCD when we lived together. In fact, she was a terrible offender at leaving her period products and makeup all over in the bathroom and waiting for me to clean it up because of stress.  \n\n\nShe gave our 8 year old the puberty talk so she could frame it as boys becoming drooling, sweaty monsters who want to be rebellious, and she legitimately scared him to the point of tears. She picks up our 4 year old and tells him in a kid voice how his brother\u0027s going to be a gross teen with smelly pubes and underarm hair.  \n\n\nThe boys have started acting up for her and deliberately breaking rules to try to get sent home. She responds by telling them she doesn\u0027t love them/she\u0027s going to trade them for two girls, and she acts like she\u0027s having a serious talk with our 8 year old about what I did wrong and why he just can\u0027t be good. They get locked in the bedroom for hours, leading to more acting up and mischief. They pooped on the floor in there, smeared it all over the headboard of the bed, and wiped themselves on the window curtains. They make plans on how they can run away from home, and they broke a hole in the bug screen and climbed out. She screams at me over the phone like I condone those activities at my home.  \n\n\nThe damage control is intense, and it feels like just as soon as they\u0027re back to their happy, well-mannered selves, they have to go back to her house. I can\u0027t just not send them. She knows how to be just nice enough to them that they love her and miss her until they\u0027re there. I have no doubts she will call the cops and then try to sue for full custody if I don\u0027t send them. I don\u0027t think she\u0027s actually doing anything illegal. CPS gave me custody in the first place because of her attitude and mental issues, and they would have gotten police involved if it were a crime of some sort.   \n\n\nHow can I protect my boys\u0027 self-esteem while still allowing them to have a relationship with their mother? How can I stop them from acting out with poop and breaking things--they\u0027ve never done anything like that at my home, so there aren\u0027t exactly teachable examples here? At what point do I pester CPS to get her into treatment when my case is still \"under investigation\" forever?",

The oldest is a boy and naturally isn\u0027t into discussing his emotions and feelings. I don\u0027t push it but I try to get him alone to take him shopping or out to eat. Spending time in the car is a great way to connect. You don\u0027t have to even make eye contact. My son has his first girlfriend and I get to hear about it and give him some advice. He told me about the first kiss and  he has told me that she isn\u0027t ready to take it further than that. We talked about consent and respecting her boundaries. These are crucial discussions at this age. I don\u0027t mind talking to teens but they really want to talk to you. Let them know that they can. ",

  "selftext": "I\u0027m embarrassed about having to post this but I don\u0027t know where else to turn. If I am being unreasonable don\u0027t be afraid to tell me. I have no clue how normal this is. \n\nMy husband and I have shared custody of his kids. They are 14 and 10 and are both boys. We have a 4.5 year old daughter together. We get them Wednesday after school and they sleepover. They come back on Saturday and stay until Sunday evening. The boys share a room. \n\nLately my stepson has been sleeping the the family room for naps after school and he will sometimes sleep in there overnight. He says it\u0027s more comfortable than his room and he doesn\u0027t have to share it with his brother. The problem is that he is going through puberty. Things are happening and it\u0027s noticeable when there is a tent being pitched in his pants. My daughter has asked about it and I don\u0027t know what to do. My husband doesn\u0027t think it\u0027s a big deal but said he will talk to him if it really bothers me. It does but I don\u0027t have teens yet and want to make sure this is a reasonable request. We have offered to put in a divider in his room so he has some privacy from his brother but he says he prefers the living room. Is it unreasonable to ask him to only sleep in his room so we dont have to deal with the uncomfortable situation that naturally arises when other parts of his body are awake before he is? \n",

  "title": "Trying to defend my daughter from girls at school and reporting it will make it worse. Opinions please?",
  "selftext": "My daughter is 15. She’s a cheerleader and has been on the team for 3 years. She’s been at this school since she was 6. We are very close and I’m fortunate she tells me just about everything. Fairly long, so I’ll try to shorten up a bit. \n\nShe is the laid back girl, no drama, hates talking about people and she’s the different one. She loves to wear black and listens to rock music (technically due to me listening to it). They’ve always picked on her for it. They send nudes, smoke, drink, your somewhat typical unsupervised teen these days. \n\nAt cheer camp, the coach left them alone to practice for competition. There were about 5 girls and 1 boy in the room. She tells me one girl snuck in a vape and they were passing it around. (Yes, I realize this is far from the worst they could be doing). They tried to get her to do it, she refused. They began to bully her, all of them. Cussing her, pushing her, calling her names. Her first peer pressure incident. She did it. One girl stated she was about to get “the good stuff that gets you jazzed” and my child left when she walked off. \n\nNothing else was said about it. Daughter tells me AFTER we get home, because she knew I’d be upset. I talk to the coach, set a meeting, and discuss options. Three of these girls are best friends and all are kids of teachers at the school. I’m given two options: first, they can bring them in, question them, and go from there. They’ll have to prove it happened and have evidence she brought it with her. Basically, a she said, 4 vs. 1 situation. They said they’ll try to keep her anonymous, but they couldn’t promise it. IF it’s found to be true, they’d get 4 days ISS at most. Second, they could do a group talk, and tell the girls they know they do it from parents seeing posts on Snapchat and tell them it’s not allowed and so on.  \n\nThese girls will make her life absolute hell if they find out. Even the coach told the principal that she feared for my child’s safety if they found out. We’d have to move and I don’t want that for her. I’m angry though. I want these girls to be punished. They never get in trouble and I hate that they won’t, unless my child’s name is involved. My daughter is done with it and said just to not go further. Anyone have their thoughts on what they would do? Had a suggestion to send an anonymous letter to the parents, but these days, I don’t see how the parents would take it seriously. \n\n",

  "selftext": "My family has had a lot of struggles in recent years. Deaths in the family, we have moved 6 times to 4 different states from the gulf coast up to the Pacific Northwest. My mother in law lived with us for 3 years and the last year was especially brutal. She was mean to my kids and us including our pets. We had to take her to court to get her out! My husband is struggling to quit drinking. My daughters brother is 8 years older than her and recently moved out of state. She is going through puberty as well. She never has listened and followed directions the best but it’s actually gotten way out of control now., no matter what types of discipline we have tried. She has a best friend who’s mom often takes her out for fun stuff a lot and out of her own pocket. We are struggling financially right now so this is a blessing for us for her. Her friends mom told me today when they were leaving for the zoo that my daughters just too disrespectful and won’t mind her and if it doesn’t stop she will no longer be invited. I don’t blame her, however it’s been almost a year and this is the first I’m hearing about this from her. I feel so bad right now. I feel like I’m failing as a mom however I know I’m not because I am reaching out for help and not just giving up. Aside from therapy to help her have an outlet, which I’m working on, what are some things that have worked for you regarding your preteens especially girls??? HELP!! 🤔😔",

  "title": "Confession: I hate my son, hate being a dad, hate my life (long rant)",
  "selftext": "I realize this will probably get a lot of anger for me, but I need to get this off my chest at least once in my life.\n\nMy son is turning 14 and I realize now that I hate him.  I have tried to be a good dad to him but he has been a plague in my life.  He lies about everything, he steals from not only me but everyone we know, I have had to apologize for him millions of times.  I live in fear of him one day figuring out he can start calling my work and make up some story to get me fired... I thank god he hasn\u0027t thought of that one yet.  He was a premie and he\u0027s always going to be small, and I thank god for that too because he is a violent asshole, I\u0027ve had to defend myself against him time and again, mind you he has never been in a fight at school (that I know of) because frankly he is a coward and would never mouth off to somehow who can legally kick his skinny ass.  Me?  Not so much, I\u0027m not a big guy so he actually can hurt me when he punches or kicks or bites.  I know nobody will believe me but I have never in my life raised a hand to him in aggression, but last winter after he came at me and I clocked him one in self defense and he called the police to the house, mind you after he called he started to smashed his head over and over into the fridge to give himself a bump and bruises.  I think this is psychopath behavior.\n\nI was with his mom for about 4 months and we had unprotected sex one time which resulted in her becoming pregnant.  We weren\u0027t in love and in fact we were fighting all the time even before she became pregnant.  I won\u0027t say too much about it but she was a really toxic person who tried to blackmail me if I didn\u0027t do everything exactly her way, and in fact all the toxicity was already there before we ever even had sex.  Suffice to say I was young and a total idiot and I fell into her trap.  She would threaten to smoke pot or drink and hurt the unborn baby whenever we fought, her way to control my actions.  We finally broke up about a month before she delivered, and I want to stress that I am not the person who left and I did not abandon her.\n\nAnyway I was prepared to do what I had to do, even though I had no plans to be with her but I would pay what little I had and try to be in my son\u0027s life even though I knew it would be hell.\n\nWell she died in childbirth and I\u0027m left to raise my son alone.  I have no family, mom died a long time ago, got a brother somewhere but I\u0027m pretty much alone, nobody to help me with this (her mom used to live in my town but she is drug addict with her pedophile husband, now I don\u0027t know where she is or if she is even alive).  I get some help from the community center but really it\u0027s just me and him.\n\nWe have been to different counsellors and honestly I can\u0027t really afford it even with insurance covering 30%, plus he couldn\u0027t care less about it and just getting him to sit there and actually talk takes more energy than I currently have.  There is no free professional counselling service within 100 miles, the only free service anywhere around here is at the church and we tried it and it was a total waste of time.  I believe a real psychologist can help us but I simply can\u0027t afford to throw all that money away if he won\u0027t even try.  He even told me he wants me to go bankrupt so I will go to jail, so telling him the financial situation only makes it better for him.  He says it even when things are fine, all joking, but it worries me that he thinks it\u0027s funny to hurt me.\n\nYes, I realize I raised him so he is my responsibility.  I also realize he comes from bad genes (mine included) so what chance did he have?  The thing is I really tried to be a good dad I could be, it wasn\u0027t enough and I failed, but at least I tried.  I was overwhelmed from day one and knew I would fail, and I did so no big surprise there.  But I just feel like I have been fucked over by life and I don\u0027t know what I could have done differently to raise him better.  I didn\u0027t always hate him, but now I can\u0027t hide from the feelings I have anymore, even though in my daily life I could never admit what I am admitting here now.\n\nI drink to give myself a few hours a day where I don\u0027t feel like killing myself.  Every day is just worse and worse.  I just know one day he is going to make something up to destroy me just to show he has power over me more than I have over him.  Nobody will ever believe a guy like me if my son decided to ruin me by making up even more damaging stories about his life... in a way I think the only reason he hasn\u0027t ever tried to really hurt me is because he isn\u0027t bright enough to realize how much power he already has over me.  I feel like a hostage and my life is about to implode every single day, and I feel like my life is hell.  There is no hope in sight for me, I am never going to get the big promotion, never going to meet that great woman who everyone says is out there, never going to get a vacation, own a nice car, have nice things, even have somebody who loves me and is proud of me.  I feel so pathetic even writing that.\n\nSorry for the long rant, and feel free to pile on the hate because I know in the end I am a bad father and a drunk and a failure in life.  I don\u0027t even hope for a better future, all I hope for is some hope (if that even makes sense) but I know that\u0027s like waiting to win the lottery.  ",

  "selftext": "This is gonna be a really long post. I don\u0027t know if this subreddit is the best place to ask advice for something like this, but I have no idea where else to.\n\nFirst off, here\u0027s some background: my wife and I took two children into foster care about a year ago, a girl now aged 12 and a boy now aged 9. They\u0027re biological siblings. They\u0027ve been through severe physical, emotional and sexual abuse in their early childhood, and had to be removed from their biological family. We were the first family to foster them. \n\nWe\u0027ve been informed that the girl had some behavior issues before we took her and her brother into our care, and that she had been diagnosed with Conduct Disorder. However, I had no idea how bad it really was.\n\nThe girl has no respect for me or my wife. She\u0027s extremely violent towards her brother: during the last month alone, she slammed his head into walls, kicked him in the groin countless times, cut him with a razor, spit in his face, even tried to strangle him. She\u0027s violent towards our 10 y/o biological daughter as well, but not as much. She stabbed the neighbors\u0027 dog with a screwdriver. She tried to steal money from strangers\u0027 pockets and from my wallet. She lies about everything. She\u0027s swearing non-stop, and has no filter whatsoever. She threatened to commit suicide or to self-harm several times just to scare us and get our attention, then proceeded to laugh and call us \u0027stupid f\\*cks\u0027. \n\nShe doesn\u0027t respond to neither punishment nor praise. When I try to sit her down and talk to her, she spits in my face and laughs. It\u0027s even worse for my wife: the girl punches her, kicks her and threatens to kill her on a daily basis. She\u0027s currently in counseling, but it doesn\u0027t seem to do anything for her. She\u0027s incredibly well-behaved and nice towards the counselor, and tells her exactly what she wants to hear. She acts like a completely different person outside the household. At school, she\u0027s a straight A student. We barely ever get any complaints from her teachers, except for the occasional swearing in class thing. \n\nI want to help her, I really do. I understand that she and her brother have been through things that no child should ever go through, and that this probably has a lot to do with the way she behaves now. But I don\u0027t know *how* to help her. ",

So after a while we ended up communicating and talking on the phone. I was head over heels for her. I don\u0027t know why I really liked her even though she has many flaws and all the differences between us. We talked for a few weeks and I kinda realized she just wanted sex. We talked and basically it was to be nothing serious. I\u0027m 19 and shes 23. So we had sex it was  great and whatever. And we talked a few more weeks later and then she stopped talking to me. Just never texted me at work never said anything to me. Just avoided me. So i asked her whats up one day and she made up some story. Then ended up in a relationship with somone. Because she posted in Facebook. The status isn\u0027t there anymore.\n\nI was kinda hurt my relationships in the past have made me a hard shell to actually liking somone. And when i find somone i click instantly with it just  hurts. But i just continued doing my job. And she ends up not working there anymore. For reasons.\n\nSo now for the title. Its been 7 weeks since that night. And I checked her Facebook and her bio says. \"Can\u0027t wait to hold you in my arms\" 😍🤰(heart eyes) (pregnant emoji) and not in a relationship.\n\nI\u0027m nervous. Really nervous. She hasn\u0027t texted me anything i haven\u0027t talked to her since she left the job site. I talked to friends and explained and theres a chance if shes pregnant im in that time frame. \n\nI could go on and on about this. But any words of advice what i should do. \n\nShould she have told me? \nShould I ask her? \nShould I wait it out? \nWould she post that for somone else baby?\nCould she even be pregnant? \n\nI think I hit all the major points theres more details. Bug this could be a whole book. \n\nBut I\u0027m 19. Shes 23 she already has a child. \n\nPlease don\u0027t roast me to hard 😂 lol.\n\nMy friend told me not to stress about it and just ignore it. \n\nAnd Another friend said wait some time to see if shes pregnant. Wait for a time frame and compare then talk to her. \n\nIt is going to be my child I\u0027m gonna be in its life. If it comes to be. But i feel like if it is going to be. Might be a long battle. \n\nSucks even more because she stopped talking to me. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/991fh9/might_be_a_father_but_unsure_the_girl_hasnt/?utm_source\u003dreddit-android\n\n. \"Can\u0027t wait to hold you in my arms\" 😍🤰(heart eyes) (pregnant emoji) and not in a relationship.\n",

  "title": "Dear new parents of reddit",
  "selftext": "I like to think of myself as an egoist who likes to help others. Whether it\u0027s wrong or not, I don\u0027t really care what you think.\n\nSome time ago, a new parent was freaking out about having a child. I spent some time and poured my soul into a post that, I feel, could have helped many new parents or parents to be, have a different perspective on fatherhood. I am not a doctor, I have not read the books, this came from my observations. Here is the reply I put up to help you deal with fatherhood easier. I have updated it a bit. Let me know your thoughts and additions to the list in the comments:\n\n1. EVERY child is different.\n2. A parent whose kid is older than yours and gives you advice about your younger child because that\u0027s how it they remember it, is BS. Brains are made to forget, you won\u0027t remember what you\u0027ve been through when your child was 1-2 months vs now when they\u0027re 6-12 months.\n3. Have a rule with your partner: if I can\u0027t handle it anymore, you take the child until I calm down. Don\u0027t get annoyed and feel that you cannot do anything, you\u0027re in this together! Follow the rule, no one gets upset and you will not be a hero if you put up more time and nerves just to become a wreck!\n4. The mother will go through a lot and she WILL change. Be patient!\n5. You will not get sex too often anymore, understand it and if you want it, make sure both of you get enough rest and enough time to take care of yourselves. Clean, shave, make-up, dress up, plan it.\n6. Sleep deprivation is the enemy, not your wife, not your child.\n7. The kid comes into a new world. I would fucking scream if I wake up in a new world! It\u0027s normal, try to understand that it\u0027s not because they don\u0027t like you, it\u0027s because they don\u0027t know where they are.\n8. Children push boundaries to understand the world. They are curious: this means s/he will scream louder and louder as they grow older. Don\u0027t think it\u0027s dying, they\u0027re stronger than you can imagine, take a look what they go through when they come into this world.\n9. You don\u0027t know your child! Your child doesn\u0027t know you! It takes time to get accustomed to each other. More precisely: 2 years. RESIST 2 years and your world will be better. I know you want it now, not in 2 years, but it will come to you.\n10. It is an ANIMAL first: poops, eats, sleeps. Basics. Don\u0027t expect big things, don\u0027t force big things. If you get annoyed, at any moment, it is YOU, it\u0027s not the child! Don\u0027t be disappointed, it only means that you set yourself up for disappointment, the LO has nothing to do with you or her being crazy.\n11. You WILL fight with your wife, over your child. Understand it, embrace it, don\u0027t go in to bed angry, this is for life, and you screamed your lungs out to the world when it was born.\n12. It is a miracle, whatever your definition of a miracle might be. But YOU and HER made it. Treasure it as such.\n13. WATCH IT! really, look and observe your child, see how it behaves, how it evolves, how it grows. Watch it with a purpose: to learn from it. You can and you should learn: curiosity, bravery.\n14. TRUST your child. You have forgotten the basics because they got into your system. They are developing a system and they know exactly what they need to know to survive, nothing more, nothing less. Don\u0027t assume things about your child.\n15. IT CHANGES! When we\u0027re grown, we think it takes a lot of time to change. That\u0027s false. Human beings change every day to such an extent that we are completely different than we were. This is very visible to infants. Just because it used to be or do something yesterday, does not mean it will be the same today. ADAPT, ADJUST and CHANGE. This is what they do, follow! Call it Agile ;) (for the ones familiar with Agile)\n16. Practical things: rash, use cream or powder, after lukewarm water bath. sometimes what needs to be done, needs to be done, whether is waking up in the morning, a vaccine, or getting dressed. They may cry, no reason to stop, but don\u0027t stress the child either.\n17. They will suffer! Hard as it might sound, they will get ill, a lot, in the first years. Sometimes you\u0027ll feel powerless. Just being there and holding them is enough, no need to get depressed or upset that you can\u0027t do more. Like when we\u0027re adults: some fights need to be fought alone and parents can only be there for comfort, not to fix. Be there for them, don\u0027t get stressed about it!\n18. DO NOT fight with your wife with the child in the room. They sense the tension and they will cry louder.\n19. Getting there: You will not communicate with your wife anymore, to an extent that you might not even know who she is. You\u0027ve been warned now that this is coming, you\u0027d better not fuck it up with her, you are a team and the LO is the 3rd player. No excuses! Communi-fucking-cate! Whenever you can, however you can, don\u0027t drop the communication ball! TALK to your wife! Before and especially after birth!\n20. ENJOY IT! Every second of being with the child: dance, talk, look at it, kiss, cry, smile, laugh, it\u0027s a rollercoaster, better sometimes than the love you share with the mother. No matter what happens, enjoy, celebrate and LOVE YOUR CHILD! You wanted it, and you made it! Cherish your child, it\u0027s only the beginning!",

I\u0027m mainly curious about children at a teenage / high school level.  Do you utilize what your religion stipulates, what your own parents taught you, standard societal stereotypes?  Honestly speaking, would you speak to your sons differently than your daughters? \n\nI\u0027m asking as a university student since so many of my peers have differing views on what type of sexual behavior is \"normal.\" \n\nSomeone on reddit made the claim that sex is one of the most highly social activities and most people don\u0027t have the basic social skills to handle it.  It\u0027s a very interesting idea and if you would like to speak to that instead, feel free.  \n\nBiological parents, step parents, grand parents, anyone can feel free to chime in.  ",

  "title": "(routine) ENT surgery on a nearly 5 year old...",
  "selftext": "I guess I’m looking for internet hugs, and perhaps a good idea or two?\n\nSo my son, who will turn 5 on Thursday, is going into hospital tomorrow morning for very routine ENT surgery (tonsils and adenoids out, ear tubes in). He needs this. Clearly. History of ear and throat infections, night terrors, restless sleep, increasingly looking tired and lacking sleep even when he was asleep for 11+ hours… and the last year at school his teacher noticed his concentration and hearing were worsening, I also noticed I was having to shout to get his attention more… but he has a 2.5 year old sister, and I’ve just gone back to work more-or-less full time, so life has changed, so I didn’t think toooo much of it… But when his teacher mentioned it to me I made him an ENT appointment. Dr did basic tests, then sent him for more tests, and then yada yada yada… 50% hear loss in one ear, 20% in the other, enlarged adenoids yada yada yada…\n\nHis surgery is tomorrow morning at 8. We are expats, so we’ve had to go to a neighbouring country for this diagnosis and treatment – right now little one and myself are on 38th floor in an awesome AirBnB stuffing ourselves with imported berries – but my husband and littlest one are far away – and both my son and I are missing them. He doesn’t really know that Thursday is his birthday, he just knows its soon. All being well, son and I will travel home on Sunday, and husband and littlest one are planning a birthday surprise for him then, so I’m not super worried about that part of it, it’s more, how do I explain to a little person that they need to have a medical intervention that they don’t want? And I’ve spent some time explaining that his body is his, and mine is mine and yours is yours and consent and and and…. And now I’m saying ‘yeah, tough, you need this and are getting it done.’\n\nMy son has told me several times today that “I like the way I am now Mama”, in response to suggestions that the surgery will make him feel better. I bribed him through all the blood work and etc today with a (hideous) paw patrol backpack with puzzles in it, and he will wake up to a Chase night-light and I have a cool toy for him once he’s in recovery… But.\n\nApart from bribery – all the ice cream and all the screen time he wants for first few days – what else can I say to help him accept that this is something he needs? Any cunning ideas for helping him (AND ME) through this?",

  "title": "Putting Parent\u0027s Behavior In Context",
  "selftext": "Sorry if this isn\u0027t the appropriate place to post this. \n\nSo, I\u0027m a guy in his late twenties with a child born around the beginning of the year. So far he\u0027s been developing great. However, fatherhood has made me start trying to put my father\u0027s behavior in context. \n\nSo, my father is a smart, talented, and generous man. He has definitely helped a lot of people out, both personally and my offering free professional work. He made sure that growing up, we never lacked for anything, and made sure we got good educations (my siblings and I were homeschooled), etc. The worst that could be said in that area is that our cars were a little older than idea or our vacations were hiking a state park rather than beaching in Cancun. When I read the stories about people that were physically or  sexually abused, dealt with parents on drugs, or worse, I feel bad about complaining, because clearly my dad wasn\u0027t anything near that bad. Still, his behavior did hurt me...just maybe not bad enough to justify complaining? Maybe someone can tell me. \n\nAnyway, Dad was very controlling, and had an explosive temper. Sometimes the controlling and the temper were tied together, and sometimes the temper was just to let off steam. He was (and is) very good at taking control of a situation and dominating people; he never hit any of us, but he never needed to. \n\nThe target was usually my mom and the pattern would go something like this: she would do something he didn\u0027t like. This would usually be something to disrupt his pattern; Dad is a very methodical, do-things-the-same-way-every-time sort of person, and she is not, to say the least. So Mom would do something buy a toothbrush with a different kind of handle than normal (all these examples are real ones), Dad would explode, accuse her of deliberately trying to ruin things, scream at her in front of the kids, occasionally throw things, and eventually storm out of the house and not come back until he cooled down a few days later. \n\n(Technically he would come back to sleep and change clothes, but only arrive after everyone was in bed. I\u0027m still not sure what he did all that time; he did work a lot, but surely not that much?)\n\nThis happened several times a month (often a couple times a week) throughout my childhood. I remember there were four Christmases in a row where I (oldest child) had to talk him into spending Christmas with the family. It was sort of hard on us. Usually, mom would be the person he\u0027d blow up at, but often it would be at the kids, or we\u0027d get caught in the crossfire. He would call me a son of a bitch pretty frequently pretty young. (By the way, he does not drink).\n\nI guess here\u0027s a pretty representative story. I was pretty much the youngest person in the world to get migraines (seriously, who gets migraines when they\u0027re eight?), and I had a really bad headache one night. I asked my sleeping dad if  it was okay if I got some Tylenol, he said yes, I got some, and it worked so I got some sleep. It was fine until my brother mentioned he\u0027d heard me moaning in pain that night; when I mentioned that I\u0027d gotten some medicine my dad exploded and said it didn\u0027t count as permission if he was asleep. When mom tried to say I didn\u0027t think I was doing anything wrong. he was supposed to drive us to church (my family was/is religious), but instead of going in with us he just dropped my brother and I off (we were both younger than ten) and told us he\u0027d pick us up. When we got home he took my mom and me downstairs, told me never to take medicine on my own again, and that if my mom ever defended me again he\u0027d divorce her, then stormed off for a few days.  \n\nIt got worse in high school, when I started playing sports. I wasn\u0027t that good, but he was convincing the real problem was I wasn\u0027t aggressive enough out there and that I just needed to take the ball to the hoop and score. When I didn\u0027t do that he would call me a coward and a loser, often in front of my younger siblings.\n\nI guess there were a lot of other things that happened that I think about, but those are representative examples and this post is already way too long. Just know that all those sorts of things happened pretty much continually. \n\n All this were just things that happened until my wife and I had the baby. Now I\u0027m in the same position my dad was, and someone else is in the same position I was in. (And  my wife is now more in the same position my mom was in, since obviously I never knew my mom except as a mother). I guess I\u0027m trying to put this behavior in context--am I being too sensitive? I know this wasn\u0027t perfect behavior but no parent is perfect? \n\nI\u0027ve never talked about this with him, and it would not go well if I did. In his mind, he did nothing wrong, or at the worst acted poorly but was driven to it. \n\nSorry this is so long...",

  "selftext": "*trigger warning,  child rape, no details*\n\nI found out tonight that my daughter(12) was holding hands with our friends son(15). NBD right?  Our families spent the weekend together at the lake for a big friend\u0027s/family reunion. For the most part the kids were never alone together, but they weren\u0027t incredibly supervised. It was nice that our kids get along because they are both rather shy and don\u0027t have many other friends. Plus they have both been plugged into electronics all summer so we all had a good time unplugging. \n\nI\u0027m not worried about 2 kids being young and cute; holding hands is probably harmless. But I\u0027m afraid of where this is leading and how to talk to my daughter. I\u0027m afraid because 6 years ago my daughter was raped by her cousin who is only a couple years older than her, and he seemed like a perfectly fine boy. And her cousin (now 16) is good friends with the boy who held her hand. I know the cousin is sexually active, which probably shouldn\u0027t bother me, but I worry that despite police and CPS involvement, and counseling, that he didn\u0027t learn anything. And that she doesn\u0027t understand healthy boundaries. And the new boy kinda knows what happened so I worry he sees her as easy, experienced, a sexual object? \n\nHis mother confronted him, reminded him that she is only 12 and that they can only be friends. He said it\u0027s only 3 years difference, that all the adult relationships there have much larger age gaps. He missed the point (that she\u0027s too young). She told him that she doesn\u0027t want him to be acting like the cousin.  \n\nAs soon as she told me, we decided to leave. (It was getting late and we were trying to motivate ourselves to leave anyways. ) She thought I was angry but I\u0027m just incredibly scared because I can\u0027t protect my daughter and I don\u0027t know if I have succeeded in teaching my daughter how to protect herself. She has no self esteem. It\u0027s been nice to see her come out of her shell for someone. I don\u0027t want to take it away from her but I don\u0027t know what to do.\n\nMost people don\u0027t know what happened to my daughter,  but we\u0027ve changed our small town/family social dynamics because of it.  I know i\u0027ve become over protective, too. I\u0027ve been told (by the cousins mom, aka my SIL) to get out of the victim mentality, that they moved on and so should we, In response to me telling her that my daughter has recently been having nightmares/ panic attacks/ flash backs of the incident. \n\nMy daughter is still in counseling,  currently on antidepressant/ antianxiety meds for being suicidal, and having depression, GAD, and PTSD. But I don\u0027t know if the counseling is enough, it doesn\u0027t seem to be getting anywhere. And I feel like I\u0027m completely failing her, this whole thing has brought back some major ghosts for me. This isn\u0027t about me but omg it feels like it has destroyed me because I didn\u0027t protect her and i\u0027m pretty sure i\u0027m just teaching her to be anxious and scared. I don\u0027t think that I can raise a strong,  healthy daughter because i\u0027m pretty broken from my own long history of abuse. \n\nTldr; daughter (12) is a rape victim and I\u0027m worried she\u0027s setting herself up to be taken advantage of,  but also worried that I\u0027m over-reacting and definitely panicking.

We were watching the movie Rampage (me and my 9- and 6-year old -- I always pre-screen movies and skipped some of the real violence, language, etc.) starring Dwayne Johnson and a CGI gorilla. In the movie, the gorilla knows sign language and does occasional inappropriate signs -- like giving the finger (I know, well, IMO its better than fart jokes, which are so overplayed in kids\u0027 movies). Anyway, at the end of the movie when everything is over Dwayne Johnson\u0027s character meets the gorilla again, but this time with a new lady friend.  The gorilla signs/asks him who she is to which the Rock replies \"a friend.\" The gorilla then makes a sex sign putting his index finder in the hole of his hand and moving it in and out. Anyway my 6-year old is like \u0027what does that mean\u0027? I said, well, er, that they are boyfriend and girlfriend. He persists and is like \u0027yeah but why that\u0027? In a spontaneous parenting moment I say \u0027well that means he is going to put a wedding ring on her finger.\u0027 Thank you ladies and gentlemen, for reading.",

  "selftext": "I am a single father of three kids (ex wife moved to england), my first daughter is 32, is married and works as a receptionist at a veterinary clinic, my second daughter is a stay at home mom, my third child, Daniel is 28 and the world is simply too much for him. I have been reading through threads of people with similar issues, and I hope you kind people can give me your take.\n\nHe currently works at an asian grocery part time, has been there for three years since he finished uni in with a bachelor of science he speaks korean and thai, so he gets on well there. He barely has enough money to pay rent, most of it goes towards his cooking, which is the only thing that perks him up (I highly doubt he makes enough to pay, so im not sure where the rest of it comes from). He has been consistently looking for a job in his field since he finished, has had a bunch of interviews, but nothing has panned out. Unfortunately he also had proof, a fight of ours got so bad he locked me in his room in retaliation,  I accused him of making excuses for not having a better job, and refused to let me out until I had gone through a folder full of hundreds of resumes and cover letters and played out phone recordings from human resources for interviews. Everything ranging from janitor, to associate scientist. That was horrible, I had been ignoring him, and he had all the evidence to prove that he was trying his hardest\n\nHe doesn\u0027t have any friends, never had a boyfriend or girlfriend (bisexual). He only does four things, sleep, cook, go to work, go on his computer. Last weekend, he didnt have any shifts, he was asleep from 11pm on friday, to 8pm saturday, then went to bed a little before midnight, then woke up at 6ish the next day, went to bed a few hours after, then went to work monday morning. When i ask him why he sleeps so much he says \"theres no reason to be awake\". Which means that all he does on the computer is do these applications for jobs.\n\nAt one point, last year, I kicked him out, for two months, just to let him get a taste for the real world. Now he has already had issues with sleep walking, but over at a place with housemates, he got night terrors, and was kicked out by the fourth week. So nobody is going to live with him\n\nThe oldest refuses to talk to him, describing him as a \"black hole of misery\". My second daughter sent me a screen text of his chat over FB a couple of days ago. ill type it out\n\nDaniel - Have you seen this whale exploding shit?  \namy - You mean when the gasses build up, someone pokes it and they blow up.\n\nDaniel - I DIDN\u0027T KNOW ABOUT THAT, ITS SO FUCKED\n\nDaniel - oh also, evolve called, I got rejected from the fermentation job because of distance\n\namy - I thought they were in the CBD?\n\ndaniel - yeah, in goddamn richmond, thats only 15 minutes away from the uni\n\namy - have you figured out what youre gonna do....you know...when dad passes\n\ndaniel - I\u0027m screwed\n\nDaniel - I really am\n\ndaniel - The way i see it, ill either kill myself, or kill as many others as I can.\n\namy - you cant be serious, dont be a fucking edgelord\n\ndaniel - look at my life and tell me you dont see it too.\n\nEvery time I walk up to the laundry and see him sleeping at three pm, its like a stab to the gut. He barely talks, he doesnt want to see a therapist, he just shrugged and said \"you cant bring the dead back to life\" and refused to say anything else. I\u0027m just at a loss, I wont be around forever, but I dont want to live to see the death of one of my kids.",

  "selftext": "Okay, so my son is 7 years old (he turns 8 in October) \n\nI’ve been pretty lax with him when it comes to YouTube. He had it on his iPad and i monitored what he watched. Most of the time it was little kids playing with toys or video games. Until i found out one of the “kids” channels he was watching wasn’t for kids at all. There’s videos that adults make using kids plush toys and they sometimes act out sex scenes.\n\nI didn’t know about the sex scenes until i caught him humping a blanket. His dad just caught him humping a chair over the weekend. So when we asked where he got this from he told us and i watched them and was mortified. Since then we’ve restricted his use of YouTube and even put so many controls on his tablet he pretty much can’t do anything without our permission. \n\nI guess I’m just wondering, how young have you caught your kids doing this? 7 just seems so young to me for him to be doing it.  And i found out today it’s not just the humping, he actually plays with himself too. I remember being super young as a girl humping things because i figured out it felt good, but i never did it because i was imagining having sex or anything. I’m just nervous he’s been exposed to sexual things too early and it’s my fault. I know not to yell at him or make him feel bad for it but i don’t want to encourage him to do it either. \n\nThanks for any advice or input!",

My husband also teaches middle school, coaches high school, and we have an almost 11 year old getting ready to start middle school so this conversation is a little more serious now than it was when it was purely a long distance hypothetical. \n\nWe were rewatching a TV show (Blackish) and there was an episode about the two teenagers (18 year old daughter in college and 16/17 year old high school son) becoming sexually active and the parents dealing with the fallout. They played the classic \"dad doesn\u0027t want to lose his baby girl\" and \"mama bear can\u0027t let go of her little boy cub\" trope but I was wondering how accurate that is in real life. How did you respond to realizing your kids were sexually active? Did they tell you? Were you okay with it as long as they were using protection? Did you talk to them about it?

As for my daughter, she’s doing well. Back to her “normal” self, she’s a funny kid so normal is a loose term.\n\nThis morning we had an extremely early appointment with a John Hopkins affiliate hospital who provided us with a pediatric doctor who specializes in childhood female trauma and a non play based psychiatrist. \n\nThe doctors let us know that are no signs of sexual assault but they definitely agree she is telling the truth about being hit. \n\nWe also learned throughout the night she was being bullied by another girl who kept calling her “nasty and dark” for the record my daughter is mixed and was the only person of color at the party. This girl is ripped out her earrings. \n\nI also reached out to Anna’s mother, I was surprised how concerned she was when I told her and said how sorry she was, her son was only home for about an hour between baseball practice and his friend picking him up for a concert. I also brought up the fact he hit my daughter and called her the n-word. She was upset he said these thing but said unfortunately he mainly lives with father who perpetuates these beliefs. \n\nWe are now heading to drop our daughter of at her cousins who is aware of the situation while we go to file a police report and provide them with the doctors findings. His mother says she will comply and if she needs to turn him in she will.\n\nWe will be faxing some paperwork to her school and will request she not be allowed in a class with Anna next year. \n\nAfter doing all of this I’m going to take a Xanax, and breathe before head to the waterfront to see some fireworks for Old Towns birthday. \n\nWe let our daughter know how proud we are of her and that she’s so strong that she’s helped make sure he won’t hit anyone else. \n\nThank you all for the kind words!",

  "title": "My divorce has severely strained my relationship with my teenage son, what can i do to repair it?",
  "selftext": "Hi, i need some advice. So, i am a father of 2 beautiful children. A son who just turned 13, and a daughter that is 6. We used to be a big happy family, but unfortunately my wife and i decided to get divorced. It just wasn\u0027t working, we couldn\u0027t get along, we had irreconcilable differences. We tried therapy, but nothing worked. It was for the best, we started arguing a lot, and we both decided it would be for the best if we got a divorce. We heavily discussed everything that would happen with our children.\n\nWe filed for divorce about 6 months ago. Now, in the divorce, my wife got the house, and we split custody, she has full custody of our daughter, while i have full custody of our son. We each have visitation rights on the weekends. So, i get to spend the weekend with my daughter, and he spends weekends with his mom. It was a settlement we both agreed on, that we\u0027d split custody. We both believed it would be unfair if just one parent got full custody of both. So, we came to this agreement, we settled on me getting my son full time and her getting our daughter full time. Since, the biggest influence on a child\u0027s life is the same sex parent. My son and i moved into a new apartment. It\u0027s a lot smaller then our old house, just 2 bedrooms. He was really quiet for a while, i just assumed it was because he was upset from the divorce, which was understandable. I had sympathy for him (because my parents also divorced) So, i just let him slide whenever he\u0027d lash out at me. He\u0027d cry a lot, then as well. However, as time went on, he developed more of an attitude. He is incredibly disrespectful to me. He generally will not talk to me, and when he does, it\u0027s usually sarcasm or rudeness. He is very resentful, and at times, he\u0027s outright defiant.\n\nI\u0027ve been asking why he\u0027s acting like this, he said it was because he wants to live with mom, and finds it unfair that his sister gets to. Honestly, he always was kind of jealous of her when she was a baby. His mom didn\u0027t have much time for him after our daughter was born (he was 7 when she was born). I tried to spend time with him though, but he never seemed to enjoy it, spending time with me. I remember, when his sister was a baby, he\u0027d practically beg her to play with him, spend time with him (she required A LOT of attention, she was a very high-maintenance baby. But, if i offered to play with him, he\u0027d always shout \"No! I want mom!\". But, after she grew older, mom was able to spend time with him.\n\nBut yes, he constantly vocalizes his opinion that he should get to live with mom. He makes no attempt to hide it. I\u0027ve tried to spend time with him, but he never wants to. I mean, i get it, it\u0027s tough. Moving from a fairly large home to a 2 bedroom apartment, only seeing his mom on weekends, but it\u0027s been 6 months and It\u0027s very heartbreaking that my son hates being around me so much, but what can i do?",

  "title": "The system is failing my 6yo son and I need advice",
  "selftext": "Two weeks ago, we were at a party and neighbor mom approaches my wife and I. She said that neighbor dad found my (6 years old) son’s face between (7 years old) neighbor son’s leg with his pants off. This was TWO FULL DAYS after the event. She went on to say that we needed to establish new boundaries. I went white, my memory blank for the next few hours. \n\nThat evening we sat my son down to ask him about what happened and he shut down completely. I have never seen him do this, ever. He ran to the bedroom and hid under the covers. We ask him if he wanted to talk tonight or the next day. He said the next day. The next morning, we asked him about it again and we were able to ask him yeses and nos. We listed all of his friends, family members and parents of friends. He said he felt safe with everyone in his close circle except every family member living in the neighbor’s house. He concurred that neighbor son was naked and he was not and that something “uncomfortable” happened. \n\nThe following day we were able to get him to speak more freely. He said that the neighbor son told him to do it and there was physical contact. He said the father told him not to tell his parents. With that we decided him to get him into counseling right away. After speaking with the counselor by phone and before he met with the counselor, she indicated that we needed to file a police report ASAP. We did that evening and my son was interviewed by child protective services the next morning. He recounted all of the above information within 10 minutes of talking with the CPS investigator. \n\nAfter one week after the initial report and two counseling sessions, my son’s story became:\n\n1.\tMy son was watching TV with the younger neighbor’s brother in the living room.  Neighbor mom was asleep on the couch. \n\n2.\tNeighbor dad came home. \n\n3.\tNeighbor dad asked my son to go into the neighbor son’s bedroom. Neighbor son was naked. \n\n4.\tNeighbor dad told my son to put his mouth on neighbor son’s penis and then to touch his penis. \n\n5.\tMy son did not touch neighbor dad’s private parts. \n\n6.\tNeighbor dad told my son not to tell his parents or neighbor dad would kill my son. \n\n7.\tThey went back to playing. \n\nSo I call the CPS investigator and detective of the police department and tell them this new information. I requested a second interview with the CPS investigator. She refused. They said since his story has changed there is nothing they can really do about it. \n\nTen days after the initial interview, the CPS investigator finally went to the neighbor’s house. They did answer. We know they were home because all the lights went out. Same thing happened the next day and two days after that. The last time the CPS investigator left a card. They agreed to meet her a few days later. \n\nShe interviewed them and told me since the neighbor boy’s story and the father’s story was different than my son’s story. It was a case of he-said-he-said. And there isn’t anything she could do about it. She asked the child and the father about the threats and they denied that there were any threats. No shit, Sherlock. \n\nThe next day we contacted the CPS investigator’s superior and unleashed, giving them details from my son’s counseling sessions and follow ups at home (abovementioned) and all the odd things about the dad:\n\n•\tFrequently wrestles for longs periods of times with boys\n\n•\tOffers to babysit the neighborhood boys\n\n•\tSits at the kids table during dinner while all the other parents are at another table. \n\n•\tLet’s his son walk around the neighborhood in underwear daily\n\n•\tLet’s his son walk around the neighborhood in a negligée\n\n•\tAfter his son has hit my son in my presence, I’ve taken both to the dad and he doesn’t discipline his child but asks what my son did to provoke his son to hit mine. This has happened multiple times. \n\n•\tI could go on…\n\nAfter we unloaded on the DPS again, they set up a forensic interview. The forensic investigator wanted to talk to one of the parents first. My son did not want to be separated. Finally, we convinced him to go for a walk while mom talked to the forensic investigator. Then they asked my son to come back alone. We could not go with him. Finally we convinced him to do it and within 5 minutes, he was back in the lobby. He wouldn’t talk. She asked to see me. I went back and she basically said that he didn’t say anything. I explained that he has experienced a traumatic event and it is hard for a six year old to blurt out the details of such an event without warming up to him. She was straight up flippant with me. “I’ve been doing this for 25 years and I’ve never seen a kid run out of here and not tell their story.”    I said, “Well, that should be a huge red flag to you that something is seriously bothering him and that we might need a bit of time to allow him to warm up to you.”  Apparently, I questioned her authority and she said, “This interview is over.” \n\nThey gave my 6 year five minutes in a small room with white walls and pushy, non-compassionate investigator to tell his story. When he wouldn’t, they basically said there is nothing they could do. They wouldn’t allow him to wait in the lobby and be comforted by his parents for 30 minutes to allow him to warm up and gain the courage to speak out for himself. \n\nI feel the system failed my son and I don’t know what to do. He will be fine. He’s in counseling. He’s got two parents that cherish him. But I truly worry for the neighbor son. In my heart of hearts, I believe my son. I know that the neighbor son has been sexually abused for quite some time by his father. I went to the police not to protect my son from this man (that’s my job), but to investigate this man as a potential pedophile. And the key witness is my little boy, who is too afraid to talk in a five minute interrogation. \n\nTo make matters worse my son is best friends with the across the street neighbors. The patents were our good friends. They have refused to talk to us (but the other neighbors) because of how we are treating them. This breaks my heart the most. I can help my son. I can advocate for him. But to punish him my not allowing him to see his best friend (not involved in the incident) is the worst punishment imaginable for his little heart. ",

  "selftext": "For context, I\u0027m an old fashioned mom of 4, and I don\u0027t have any strong opinions on LGBT either way. In this family, I should say it\u0027s not something that is seen as normal. My husband and his parents are very religious and see it as a sin, but love the sinner. They keep their opinions to themselves outside of church.\n\nMy oldest son (11) has been asking adults lately how to tell if someone is gay. He asked my FIL and got a religious answer as expected, and that deterred him for a while, but later he asked me twice if the adult brother of his 13 year old best friend is gay. I said it\u0027s none of his business the first time I asked, and then the second time I said you have to ask him yourself because I don\u0027t go around investigating people\u0027s sexual orientation. He said he did ask several times and didn\u0027t get an answer. The guy kept joking or saying, \"Are you?\" instead apparently. I grounded my son for being rude with the nosy personal questions.\n\nHis friend\u0027s brother is out of college and looks around 22. Nothing about him screams gay to me. He took my son to the fair and to a water park with his friend, and the two got on well talking about nature and ourdoorsy stuff. I don\u0027t know if he\u0027s been saying inappropriate things about gay people to my son or if he\u0027s learned it somewhere else.\n\nMy son likes him a lot and wants to know more about him, but the questions are overly personal. He got a new bike and wanted to go over and show his friend\u0027s brother, who doesn\u0027t live with them, and I had to argue with him that he doesn\u0027t care about that. He\u0027s going to lose all his friends in middle school if he\u0027s asking everyone if they are gay and being overly personal.",

She was unable to void and was about 3-5 at the time. They brought her into a dark room with one overhead light, stripped her waist down, had SEVERAL nurses hold her down (both arms against the table, etc) while they forcibly inserted a catheter into her. They forced her legs apart so hard that their legs were shaking. She was obviously screaming for help and for her life. She has been traumatized since. She is now 22 and has been **in and out of mental hospitals,** multiple suicide attempts, can\u0027t be near little kids crying or she absolutely melts down, can\u0027t go into doctor\u0027s office, **has sexual dysfunction from this.** WTF?? And obviously we never sued any of the nurses responsible for this trauma because they were \"doing their job\". My daughter literally has to go to rape support groups because that\u0027s the only definition that fits her experience. Help please. ",

  "title": "UPDATE: Jealous and hostile 17yo regarding 1yo",
  "selftext": "Hi everyone. Thank you for all your responses! Per the general take, my husband had a serious and compassionate talk with his cousin. I don\u0027t want to say too much about the specific situation, but those of you who suspected she is going through something major suspected correctly. She told my husband she was sexually assaulted at a party recently and has been \"messed up\" ever since. It doesn\u0027t excuse all of her behavior, but it obviously makes us all a hell of a lot more sympathetic. My husband is working with his family members to make sure she gets the help she needs (vague to protect details). I feel awful that I immediately went to anger instead of concern, and it is a good reminder to be open-hearted.\n\nThis will seem petty in compassion, but we also discovered that she tried to steal our Nintendo Switch from us (her mom found it in her suitcase and told us it must have \"fallen\" in...even though they were at a hotel). She also tried to claim that my necklace was hers and that we have the same one (it was custom). So we\u0027re trying to figure out how to separate what happened to her and dealing with that with kindness, compassion, and support...while also holding her accountable for her behavior, over time. Easier said than done, especially because her mom is an ostrich about this issue. But at least we have a baseline for what is going on. Obviously her safety and mental health are paramount, and come before the behavioral fall out from the situation.\n\nFor the time being, she won\u0027t be spending time with our daughter. This was agreed by all parties.\n\nThanks again. \n",

  "title": "PARENTS: Don’t let your kids play ROBLOX!",
  "selftext": "I am writing this in response to recent reports of “simulated rape” in which a young players parent found her daughters avatar being sexually assaulted online by a group of male players. It has compelled me to come forward and say with a heavy conscience that this incident is in no way isolated, and is without a doubt hundreds of times more mild than what I have myself witnessed and experienced in my time playing this game.\n\nSpeaking as a decade-long player, mine is a dark story of exactly what goes on in this dysfunctional, depraved online community. I have since quit.\n\nFor those that do not know, ROBLOX is an online game on which players can build, design and market their own games and play others’ as well. I was 9 when I joined and when I left I was 18 going on 19.\n\nOn paper, it is a game with noble intentions: to incentivize and inspire creativity in folks, offering a free and dynamic platform for aspiring game designers, casual or otherwise, to let their imaginations run rampant. On the surface, ROBLOX has accomplished this and then some.\n\nBeyond the public’s eye, however, exists a larger, darker and infinitely more complex community. Those with little interest in the simplicity of ROBLOX’s creative, wholesome nature find themselves in guild-like organizations of varying genres and themes called “groups”.\n\nOne’s experience in groups can vary. Groups differ from clothing brands and vendors, to role play restaurant chains, to role play nations to groups devoted to combat and war — truly, the list goes on. While it is of course possible to join a group and enjoy a modest, relaxed and enjoyable experience, those that stick around long enough in certain (not all) genres to make a name for themselves will find themselves in an extremely mature, cutthroat environment of a Machiavellian nature.\n\nThreats (both pertinent to real life and online), blackmail (both pertinent to real life and online), bullying, exchanging, leaking and exploitation of personal information and pictures, the list goes on — the depravity I have witnessed on this game is unrivalled by anything I have ever or hopefully will ever see. Users in this environment continually participate in, endorse and conduct literal psychological warfare on one another in hopes of getting ahead. Of course, none of this dialog occurs on ROBLOX but on third party communication platforms such as discord, skype, xfire, IRC, etc.\n\n**As a result you have an environment comparable to the darkest areas of even the dark web.**\n\nI grew up on ROBLOX. I spent a great deal of my childhood on this game. On it, I honed my writing, grammar, and typing skills, learned above average graphics design skills, made friendships that go beyond the game and learned a great deal about human behaviour. Perhaps most valuable to me, however, is the numerous lessons in leadership that I learned in my several years of leading and managing groups. For these reasons alone, I will never regret my time on ROBLOX.\n\nNevertheless, in addition to all the good that came out of it, the countless thousands of hours I spent in such an intense, cutthroat environment took its toll. I learned very quickly to be ruthless, cold and cunning, employing whatever means necessary to get ahead. I understood that my rivals would do everything in their power, reprehensible as it might be, to destroy not only me and my virtual projects but my willpower and willingness to continue. The objective was to win, and that often meant breaking the will of others.\n\nWhile I personally never participated in anything illegal, I knew of people who had all but sold their soul in the pursuit of victory on this silly, insignificant online game.\n\nI had fun, but I know for a fact that if my parents had ever known the extent of how brutal this game is, I would not have been allowed to play. \n\nSomeday, I hope to have children of my own, and I would sooner let my seven year old play Grand Theft Auto than ROBLOX.",

  "title": "6 year old boys sexual play, what to do?",
  "selftext": "Most of parenting isn’t too hard to figure out, but we have a bit of a parenting crisis that I’m just not sure what path to take and need your help, hivemind.\n\nWe have a happy, fun 6 year old rising 2nd grader (young for his grade but turns 7 soon), let’s call him H. Happy, smart, fun loving kid no issues there. He was in a summer camp last week which happens to also take place at the school he goes to, so he knows many of the kids. Two of his classmates, let’s say Joe and Mike (obviously not their real names) were in his camp.\n\nHis grandma (my mom) helps us and picks him up from camp for a couple hours most days until we get off work. So grandma calls us in a bit of a tizzy and reported that H told her that Joe and Mike were with him in the club house on the playground and they had all exposed themselves and invited him to. And it gets worse, he also said that they were playing the “penis in butt” game (I kid you not) and that they were going to watch him and invite him to participate “in five weeks.” So yikes. Grandma having a fit of course. We are closer to the parents of Joe, so we call his mom and before we even get midway through the story she is like, “not again!” Apparently, Joe and Mike have been caught exposing to one another before by their parents. Our friend, Joe’s mom, obviously flustered and upset and says she will do more to keep Joe and Mike apart and is so sorry our son got pulled in. Mike’s mom, who we also know and like, just don’t know as well, calls us and is also very distraught and apologetic. She has Mike in therapy and reading between the lines a bit thinks he might have been taken advantage of in the past, hence his behavior. Both Joe and Mike are not problem kids by the way, and H likes them just fine but doesn’t consider them to be his closest friends.\n\nSo now… what to do? Grandma thinks we should report this to the principal of the school, or even law enforcement, which would no doubt create a bit of a circus and certainly wouldn’t be good for Joe and Mike, nor would it be good for H other than it would likely most definitely prevent it from happening again by resulting in the removal of the kids from school (suspension? Expulsion? I have no idea).\n\nMy spouse, however, is on the other extreme and thinks we should simply warn their incoming teacher (they are all in the same class, it’s a small school one class per grade) that these three kids need to be kept apart, and perhaps banned from the treehouse and watched more closely (and hinting at the reason without giving the exact specifics).\n\nI’m sort of in between. I mean this sounds like a serious deal, these kids are 6 and 7 years old and they are playing at penis in butt? I need to protect my kid and maybe try to get those other kids out of there would be the most effective way. On the other hand, they are kind of innocent/young and I do feel bad for the other parents and they are taking the steps they should with their kids (therapy, etc) and willing to at least alert the teacher.\n\nTo further complicate, this is kind of a second question, our son told his babysitter about the incident too and she came to us worried, and of course our son could likely tell other people unless we tell him not to, but I don’t want to tell him not to because reporting this kind of thing to a responsible adult is exactly what he SHOULD be doing and I don’t want him to think it’s wrong.\n\nFinally we talked to H about keeping his privates private (we had of course told him this before but obviously it didn’t work) and told him not to play with Joe and Mike and he understands that what they did was wrong, but I worry he could easily be pressured into it again because he doesn’t seem to take it too seriously (which is both good and bad).\n\nSo yeah, like wow, what should I do? What should we tell the school or other authorities? What should we tell H? What should we tell the parents of Joe and Mike? This is a hard one\n\nShorter: Two of our (6 year old)  son’s classmates were fornicating on a playground and invited  our son to watch/participate, how seriously do we treat this and what consequences do we demand for the kids involved AND how do we avoid this happening again and hurting our kid?",

  "title": "Unchecked PPD?",
  "selftext": "Sorry it’s so long! \n\n\nWhen I had my first child 7 years ago, I denied having PPD. How could I possibly be any sort of upset at a time like this?! As time went on I noticed changes in myself. I blamed lack of sleep or being hangry or being 18 with a baby. I came to accept the new way I was without a second thought. A few years later baby #2 came. My “personality” got worse but I figured that two kids are more stressful than one! I continued to live my life very unhappy with myself.  Life went on, every day I’d hate myself more and more. Then along came baby number three! He was born 9 months ago and of course I only got worse. He was born at a stressful and busy part of our lives and I of course assumed that’s what my deal was. Three kids, A LOT going on... of course it’ll be tough! \n   During the course of all these changes I also didn’t take the time out to realize my sex life was dwindling to nothing. When my SO and I first got together at 18, we couldn’t stay out of the bedroom. We’d drop plans with friends and even school to stay in bed all day together. After our first child was born, we understandably couldn’t be that way anymore. He worked more and I was busy with the baby and taking care of the house. That brings us to 6 years later. For the past few months our sex life is few and far between. We’re nearly candidates for r/deadbedrooms. He couldn’t understand why I didn’t want to get intimate and neither could I. I’m very attracted to him but I just don’t get turned on. I started to suspect it was maybe a hormonal imbalance(not a doctor) and looked into it. As I really started to think and assess myself I thought possibly it could be PPD. \nI’ve read about the symptoms and I have all of them except having thoughts of harming my children. But I have thought of harming myself with the belief that they would all be better off without me. \n\nBefore I had children I was a happy, energetic, optimistic, patient person. I viewed my whole world with a bright aura, or that’s what it seemed like to me. Now, I’m always stressed, irritated, on the verge of tears for no reason. My sex drive is gone and I just want to be alone. I’m impatient and snappy with my kids and husband, I never want to get out with my family but I always want to be out of the house. I hate myself every day. I hate the person I am. To me, I’m the shittiest person I know. I just want to be a normal person. I want to be a great, patient mother who my family wants to be around. This is not me but I can’t will myself to be different, I’ve tried. \nDo I have PPD or does this sound like something else. I’d like to hear your (non judgemental) opinions and advice. ",

  "title": "18 Year Old Son- obsessed with sex",
  "selftext": "This will be long...very long. Please advise, as we are scared and at our wits in with his “creepiness”.\n\nSo, we (husband/wife) have an 18 year old son who graduated high school in May. He has more than his fair share of issues, and his behavior has begun to turn for the worst. He has always been very awkward, unable to make friends, and overly emotional. Just last year, he was tested and verified to be “mildly autistic”, but has no problems being a seemingly normal teenaged boy (played high school baseball at a high level, managed his grades fairly well, and has recently begun his first job). His biggest issue throughout high school was not being able to forge bonds with his peers. He seems to be viewed as the awkward, weird kid who people don’t mind talking to, but he isn’t going to get invited to weekend parties or be the guy that everyone has a good time with. This resulted in some minor bullying early on, but he defended himself and that stopped.\n\nIn high school, he began to have acne, and don’t really do much to help himself, despite our paying for doctors visits, creams, medicines and just about every treatment available at Walgreens. This compounded his problems, as he added “gross” to his reputation. He obviously has self esteem issues, and doesn’t seem to want to “fix” himself. Counseling never worked because he would refuse to truly open up. He seems to want friends, and especially girlfriends, but he won’t attempt conversation with people, so he hasn’t had either.\n\nWe’ve found porn on his phone, caught him using our 9 year olds tablet to watch it when we took his phone away and have told him that masturbating is normal, but should be handled in a private setting like the shower or his bedroom with the door locked. Recently, we’ve discovered that he has seen ads or something that’s urged him to “meet local girls” and he has of course tried...putting his debit card number on a site to “verify” his identity. After trying to explain to him that this is not something he should do, and that there is zero chance he will meet a girl pictures on the site, we found that he has written replies to e-mail messages he is getting from the so called local girls, asking if they are real and telling them to send him pictures *insert very vulgar language*. When confronted, he says “I know it’s not real, but I want a girlfriend”. \n\nThe few girls he does know from school, he texts almost incessantly until they tell him to leave them alone. Constantly asks them out, makes up insane lies trying to make himself appear rich and  has gone as far as sending a picture of his crotch (he had pants on), telling a young lady to “hit him up so she can catch this load”. \n\nWe have 3 other sons, including a 15, 12 and 9 year old. None of them have these issues. None of them struggle with having friends or girlfriends. We worry that his is exhibiting behavior of a sexual predator/stalker/general creep. \n\nHe has seen 2 different counselors who told us he wouldn’t open up to them. We will pay for him to see 20 more if it will help...but we are at our wits in with the situation...please help.\n\nTL;DR: 18 y/o male, struggles socially, seems to be willing to do anything to have sex with any female, regardless of risks/consequences.",

When I would walk into the room they would act surprised. I checked again and caught the friend and my daughter in the closet with the friend shining a flashlight on my daughters underwear. I asked what they were doing and neither of them said anything, I asked again and the older girl said the were “getting pregnant” I asked how you get pregnant and the friend said “by eating too much food.” I immediately said it was time to clean up and sent the girl home. After she was gone I casually asked my daughter to tell me more about the game and how it works and how people get pregnant and she said by sexing. I asked her if they were touching and she said that the friend touched her privates. I asked if she wanted to tell me more and she said they played a touching game and the friend touched her arm pits and privates, including under her underwear and had my daughter touch her back as well as having them lay on top of each other. My daughter said she told the friend she didn’t want to play this game and that it happened one other time the friend made her keep it a secret. I stayed very calm and reassured her that she wasn’t in trouble and I wasn’t upset with her but, I’m not sure what the next step is here. I’ve contacted the other mother and after talking to her child she found out that a boy in their neighborhood has been touching  her. I feel this went beyond innocent curiosity on the friends part but I’m not sure my daughter understands what happened. I’m not sure what the best way to move forward from here is, we’ve had plenty of talks about appropriate touching and private areas but it wasn’t enough to stop this. I’m heartbroken and don’t know what my next step is. ",

I dont want my son being brainwashed by the gay boy in the neighbourhood who stays out late having sex with older men.

  "selftext": "As the title says...\nMy husband\u0027s older brother (26M) took our three kids to the pool and on a hike today. When our two girls were asleep on the ride home, my son started asking him adult questions that kids usually don\u0027t have until they\u0027re at least 13. My BIL gave him factual answers and added it\u0027s rude to talk about these things outside of home. Questions like what a condom is and what it means to jack off, he said. My BIL asked him where he heard those phrases and he said different places.\n\nI\u0027m concerned because my husband has had incidents of being inappropriate about sex with the kids in the past. He told our daughter, when she was 3, that girls like to put hot wheels in their vajayjay and make car babies, and she hurt herself trying it, leading me to seek a counselor. We saw a mediator and he agreed not to talk about sex with or around the kids at all because what he was doing was borderline sexual abuse. They don\u0027t need to know the pervy immature things on his mind.\n\nIs my 8yo son normal or should I be worried about my husband\u0027s former antics again?",

  "selftext": "My daughter is five. A few months ago she had some potty issues and we suspected a UTI so we had her pediatrician check her out. The pediatrician didn\u0027t find a UTI, but my daughter did have a straddle injury - a scratch on her vulva. No big deal, we all move on with our lives.\n\nLast week she had a fever of 103, so we take her in. Doctor again suspects a UTI even though my daughter\u0027s only symptoms are fever and vomiting. Doctor finds a straddle injury again, no UTI.\n\nThis time the pediatrician says this is a red flag - \"kids never scratch themselves twice,\" she scares the bejeezus out of me talking about sex abuse. Eventually she settles on the idea that my daughter has this rare disease called lichen sclerosus. We were referred to a specialist at a doctor\u0027s office that has \"child abuse\" in the name and sent home. \n\nBoth times we were seen the doctor prescribed antibiotics even though my daughter had no bacterial infection so I\u0027m inclined to think she is a bit overzealous. The specialist office is expecting me to make an appointment this week.\n\n Do I have to make an appointment with the specialist? Can I get a second opinion from a different family doctor? Will this become some big scary mess? For what it\u0027s worth, I already scheduled a second opinion with a family doctor I trust a little over two weeks from now.",

  "selftext": "I won\u0027t go into detail, but we worked through one incident involving non consensual butt touching. Chalked it up to pubescent(started 6 months ago) curiosity, kids don\u0027t understand what\u0027s taboo and consent.\n\nShe lied at first, but somewhat admitted to it. We are more upset about the lying and invading someone\u0027s personal space/violating consent. We had the whole awkward talk about it being ok to be curious at her age and how to understand mutual consent and that no one owes anyone anything when it comes to their body. I had no idea how hard it would be to say the word vagina in front of her. I thought we made progress.\n\nA family member was informed of what happened and had been confided in by another cousin that my daughter tried to make her sleep naked with her. She never told anyone. I\u0027m not sure of the specifics, but this is already an alarming trend.\n\nWe already have a meeting with a counselor scheduled. We have cancelled all sleepovers indefinitely. I don\u0027t want to rain down punishments, but I\u0027m getting sick of feeling like this kid thinks she is playing us. When we pressed her about the butt touching she claimed she didn\u0027t remmeber anything, then went on about how shes not right in the head, has anxiety, stressed all the time, and depression. It sounded like a sob story honestly. I wanted to believe her. Then tonight my ex called me and told me about the other incident. I have not confronted her yet, my ex and I will do it tomorrow. \n\nSo my question is; how much of this could just be curiosity and exploring? At what point does it become a legal issue?\n\nI have talked to her about abuse. I started the \u0027no one is allowed to touch you or make you feel threatened/coerced/afraid\u0027 talk over a year ago and have reaffirmed it a few times since. She says no one has touched or abused her, but there is always that lingering horrible possibility.\n\nI am so fucking lost right now. Any advice is welcomed...",

  "selftext": "As parents are becoming crazier and crazier in this new generation listening to the internet and the crazy moms out there who are giving birth to a new generation. As those kids are getting older and older they aren’t alright. So we should ask ourselves how were you raised? Did it help. Have you reached your happiness? Question you should be asking yourself.\n\n**Keeping a healthy immune system**\n\nOne thing that needs to go is all the crazy germaphobes. Its healthy for children to get in contact with germs its healthy their body should be in contact with it, it will help their immune system and having a good immune system is a good thing. When the day comes for daycare or school your child will be in contact with many germs so thry should get use to it. For example my youngest cousin got sick on the first week of kindergarten. I also had brothers that when were younger would always eat dirt and their boogers, (eating boogers is really good for the immune system but is still gross so I wouldn’t do it) and they’ve only gotten sick two times in their life. They are now in their twenties.\n\nI know that we should keep a healthy child but don’t be afraid to give them sugar every now and then. Never before bed but before going to a park or letting them play outside, being a kid means should they live like a kid and not a mini adult that has toys. Being a child means having an imagination and always being happy. **NEVER** take a child’s childhood away. That is the worst thing you could possibly do it causes them to be unhappy in life.\n\n**How** **to control a kid with ADHD**\n\nNow with ADHD you probably want to put the kid on medication fast because you can’t handle them, **DO NOT DO THAT** most of the time the medicine prescribed doesn’t actually work and it will take time but once they are on it its terrifying. They are like emotionless zombies and I hate to see a child like this. Instead, make them run laps around the street or at the park with your supervision of course. And once old enough for sports find them a sport or more that will help them with their energy and help them make friends. When they do get old enough to be put into school and if they are too energetic then I would recommend them on medicine but only for school.\n\nMost of the time a parent will think their kid had ADHD but they might not have it or they might be Autistic. So never rule out that it could be something else.\n\n**Mental health**\n\nnow we have made it to mental health. Depression has increased a lot so there is a chance you child might just be depressed or even worse they could be a teen that hides the cuts. I don’t like to worry anyone of this and I wouldn’t start freaking out right yet and thinking that’s what going on. Fist you must understand what depression is.\n\n(this is my take on it)\n\nDepression: a feeling of being nothing, not deserving to be a live but also don’t want to die. Conflicted on where I should be and who I am. I feel as if I’m dying but on the outside people see me smile all the time.\n\nNow I do understand that most people o not understand mental health and think their kid is being dramatic and that their just emotional but if your kid says that they have been depressed don’t just say “you’re not depressed” or “you’re just *emotional”* instead ask “why is that” they might not know why which is understanding but ask them”how can I help,”\n\nAnd if you’ve searched up the side effects and see that your kid is probably only showing one doesn’t mean they don’t have it. Everyone is different depression is not the same for everyone.\n\nAlso they could be depressed if they are in the closet but never approach them ask them if their gay instead show that you are very understanding of the LGBTQ+ and do not say homophobic jokes and words that will keep them in the closet.\n\n**Any questions please contact me.**",

  "title": "My daughter (14F) just came to me with some disgusting news...",
  "selftext": "I am shocked and upset and don\u0027t know what to do.\n\nI am still very good friends with my childhood best friend. We grew up together, were there through each other\u0027s relationships, when we both married the loves of our lives, when we started having children, etc. Our families are very close. She got married and had children a while before I did, so she has older children, one of which is a 21 year old college boy. I am practically his aunt and know him very well.\n\nThe past few days I could tell my daughter was in an unusual mood, but I didn\u0027t think too much of it. Today I go into her room and see her crying. I asked her what was wrong and she said she couldn\u0027t tell me and to go away. I don\u0027t know why, but I got a really bad feeling about the situation and asked to see her phone. She freaked out and started to scream at me. After a while I got it out of her that she and this 21 year old man have been in contact and talking over the course of the past year. Wtf?? My daughter was in 8th grade!! She gave me more details about the situation and said that he would encourage her to tell him her problems so they began to form a close relationship. He started telling her that he really loved her and saw her as a little sister, but told her to keep their friendship a secret from me and my best friend (his mom) and our families. Here is what I know about their relationship:\n\n* He would video call her at night after everyone was asleep and they would talk into the night\n* He would often go on rants to her about how they can\u0027t have a boyfriend girlfriend relationship now and my daughter would not really know what to say, she would just listen\n* He constantly talks to her about inappropriate things that I don\u0027t want her exposed to right now, such as his drinking habits in college and stuff like that. I don\u0027t mind her knowing about that stuff, but I would like her to be taught about that stuff in a more responsible way. \n* His friend apparently called her drunk one time and began and began say explicit, inappropriate sexual things about both her and my best friend\u0027s son (example: \"Yoo suck his d\\*\\*k already girl!\"). I want to vomit.\n* Whenever we have family gatherings, we usually let all our children hang out together and my friend\u0027s son joins them and of course we assume he\u0027s just baby sitting and watching over the younger kids. Apparently at a gathering this weekend, he had took my daughter aside and kissed her on the lips. He told her he has feelings for her but that they can\u0027t do anything right now. I am livid.\n* My daughter feels that she might have feelings for him but she is also shaken at the same time because she\u0027s uncomfortable. Deep down I know there\u0027s something telling her it\u0027s not right, hence why she\u0027s so upset. She told me she feels like she likes him but at the same time she doesn\u0027t want him to come over anymore. I feel so sick, I feel like a shit parent for letting this happen under my own roof. How could I have let this happen???\n\nThere is so much more, this is only a small portion of the stuff she\u0027s told me, but I think it pretty much sums up their relationship. I don\u0027t know what to feel right now. Part of me wants to go over to my friend\u0027s house right now and scream at her son. Obviously I\u0027m not going to do that. But I really need some advice. I\u0027m going to tell my husband later and I know he\u0027s going to be extremely livid. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to happen with me and my best friend either. I don\u0027t even know if I care at this point about my relationship with her. I need to get some help for my daughter. I\u0027m also afraid that she\u0027s leaving details out. I don\u0027t know how bad this is. Sorry I\u0027m just rambling, my head is spinning right now and I can\u0027t get my thoughts together.",

  "selftext": "I am 28 years old and I vividly remember my mother telling me at age 9 that she was divorcing my father because he was a sex offender. I didn\u0027t fully grasp what that meant for years. He molested my older sisters friend during a sleepover. He never touched me and my siblings say the same. The divorce was finalized when I was 10 but my dad still had visitation. Because of this, my siblings and I have maintained a relationship with him. When I was 15 and doing drugs/running away because I had a fucked up life, my mom sent me to live with my dad. Because of this, we are closer than he is with my other siblings. Throughout the years I have been plagued by guilt. Most people wont understand why I would maintain this relationship with him. But he is my dad. I have thought about cutting him off but dont know if I can tolerate that guilt either. Fast forward to today, I am a 28 year old ICU nurse living with my boyfriend of 10 years and his 10 year old son. I have never disclosed this information to my bf. It\u0027s my deepest darkest secret. My dad comes around every now and then but I make sure he is never alone with my step son. After the divorce, my dad was laid off and has chosen to live a homeless lifestyle in addition to him being an alcoholic for the last 18 years. He is currently living in a motor home in the mountains. Yesterday, he came to visit and told me that he was arrested a few days ago for failing to register. I am pretty sure he is the lowest level sex offender and I didn\u0027t think he had to register. I\u0027ve thought this because he has been homeless forever and has never said anything about having to register so I\u0027m not sure what address he has been using. Anyways he told me that if he didn\u0027t give the sheriff an address today, he was going back to jail. Any sane person would have told him to fuck off but I was in shock. In 18 years he has never talked to me about his conviction. It was the most awkward moment of my life and I didn\u0027t know what to say. I was under an immense amount of pressure so I told him he could use my address. I immediately regretted it. How could I put my bf and step son at risk like that? Are my neighbors going to get letters saying an SO lives at my house??? Will a sheriff stop by and ask me if he lives here? Do I lie? Or do i tell the truth and my dad will know it\u0027s my fault he has to go to jail?? What if my bf is here when the cops come and what will he think?? My bf\u0027s family is far from perfect, his dad is a meth addict living in a roach motel but at least he\u0027s not a sex offender. Will my bf hate me for allowing my dad around his son? I texted my dad today telling him after thinking about it I\u0027m really scared and want him to figure something else out asap. Problem is, his cell reception isn\u0027t too good where he lives in the mountains so who knows when he will get that message. I feel like I\u0027ve put my bf at risk and have no choice but to tell him. What have I done?? Why am I in this situation? This is so unfair and I feel like I will continue to pay for my dad\u0027s crime as it has affected every aspect of my life since i found out what he did. I talked to my sister who said I should call the sheriff and tell the truth but I feel sick about \"turning my dad in.\" When I was an out of control teen, he really did help me change my ways and encouraged me to graduate (I\u0027m now a successful nurse) so I feel like I am betraying him. I cant be the only victim of their parent\u0027s decision. I just need someone to tell me I\u0027m not a horrible person. I\u0027ve never felt so god damn alone.",

We split up after \nSon #2 was born who is now 25M, and both of us remarried.\n\n27M was always good about being responsible as a kid. He got good grades and followed most rules without being reminded, he just fought with his brother constantly until he lost all privileges. He said his brother was an asshole and thief and hated us for giving him a sibling. As an adult, he still resents his brother and doesn\u0027t speak to him at all.\n\nThe two grew up and my first son started babysitting his baby sister (now 17F) every night without any problems while my second son was constantly in trouble with school and the law. He got terrible genes from his mom\u0027s side of the family and we couldn\u0027t keep him out of trouble. As an adult, he\u0027s knocked up three loser women and lives with one and a friend who has literally been to prison. I\u0027ve always had worry about something happening to my nieces or nephew, or if my son\u0027s going to need to be bailed out of jail in the middle of the night, and I admit my older son has only been on the back of my mind as I never doubted he would make something of his life.\n\nInstead he got done with college with good grades and then did nothing. Four months unemployed followed by a grocery store job. Four months unemployed, then he stayed at an office job he hated until he got fired a year later. Then I got him a job and he told me after a year that he hated it forever but still hasn\u0027t quit. He makes only $11 an hour and it was supposed to be temporary. He doesn\u0027t go out and talk to anyone. He goes to work and pays his bills, but then sits in bed until the next morning. My wife doesn\u0027t like him because he comes over and criticises us for never cleaning our house when we both have jobs and a little girl. I don\u0027t know what went down between them but they hate each other and my son blames my wife for being a total B to him and sexually abusing him. And she acts like he hates her for not being his mom, he\u0027s a loser, he\u0027s ungrateful, and he has all sorts of mental illnesses she finds out about on TV.  I want the two to make up but they are both stubborn little girls.\n\nI don\u0027t want my son to kill himself. I want him to do something with his life and be happy. I would support him all the way if he came to me with some goals other than sitting in bed blaming his step mom and brother for everything. He doesn\u0027t want a better apartment, better car, girlfriend, or anything that tends to motivate adults.",

I suspected for a while something about my son and it\u0027s that I suspected it was cross dressing.\n\nI never confronted him about it or anything but um he confessed something disturbing that he was molested by a neighbor and that this neighbor did things to him and that because of the things this former neighbor did he likes to dress like a girl.\n\nHe started crying saying he hates it that he doesn\u0027t want it to make him feel the way it makes him feel because he knows how it started. He says he wants to die and he doesn\u0027t want to accept or come to terms with it. He said he wants \"her\" gone from his life.\n\nI do not feel comfortable talking about this and my son he\u0027s very obsessed with \"being a man\" he\u0027s often flipped out whenever someone jokingly refers to him as a girl and I never fully understood until now. He talks about his \"alter ego\" like she\u0027s a different person and that worries me he says she disgusts him because of how sensitive she is he says when he\u0027s her he is kind and sweet but he hates how weak she is. He says he secretly likes girly things and that he hates it and he just wants to be normal.\n\nMy son told me he doesn\u0027t even know if hes gay or straight and he\u0027s afraid to play football next year and sports with his friends. He told me his counselor encouraged him to open up to me about this.\n\nI mean what do I do? I mean he\u0027s ashamed of himself and he hates I mean he genuinely hates part who he is. I\u0027ve never seen my son so broken and I don\u0027t know what to do. I mean I feel like it\u0027s wrong to let him I mean what do I do tell him he\u0027s right to hate a part of who he is? Do I tell him he should try accepting who he is?\n\nHe feels like if he embraces \"her\" he\u0027s letting the monster that did this to him define him. He also told me who did this to him and I am seething with rage because this person is someone I thought was a friend and all I want right now is to do something very violent to the bastard that did this to my son. \n\nI mean my son was crying in my arms calling himself a freak and fag how the fuck could someone do this to him? I told him I was reporting it and he freaked out saying he doesn\u0027t want people to know. He said the bastard took pictures and recordings and that he doesn\u0027t want people to see him like that.\n\nMy son doesn\u0027t want me to do anything (he\u0027s afraid people will laugh at him) but I want to make sure the son of a bitch doesn\u0027t get away with it.",

  "selftext": "Hi everyone! \n\nI hope this post is allowed here, this seemed like the best community to ask. If this is not the right place, I apologize!\n\nI am VERY ready to start trying for our first kid, but my husband is not. We\u0027ve had a few discussions over the past year around having kids, and three months ago I went off hormonal birth control in preparation (with his knowledge, and we\u0027re still using protection). I told him yesterday that I\u0027m ready to start trying, and he said he\u0027s still wrapping his head around how his life will change once we have a kid, and around moving into this new stage of his life. I understand his perspective, but I\u0027m very worried that he\u0027ll never feel \"ready\" and we\u0027ll end up waiting ages for a moment that will never come.\n\nThe agreement we\u0027ve come to is that starting in September, we\u0027re going to ask each other one question per day around being pregnant/having kids. I think this will help him process the idea of having a kid (he\u0027s someone that likes to overthink every decision), and it will definitely help prevent me from feeling like I\u0027m just waiting around for him to feel \"ready,\" which is a moment I fear may never come. Besides, these are conversations we need to have a some point regardless!\n\nSo, this is where I could use your help! I\u0027m trying to come up with a list of questions we can discuss. I want there to be some lighter ones to help get him excited for kids, but of course there should be some more serious questions too. Some of these things we\u0027ve already partially discussed (religion, number of kids, work/finances) but I feel we could stand to have a more in depth discussion. Here\u0027s what I\u0027ve got so far:\n\n* What are you looking forward to about having kids?\n* What are you nervous about?\n* Are there any naming traditions you want to carry on? Any names that you hate and will never use? Any names you love and definitely want to use?\n* Do you still want two kids? Do you want to have them close together or farther apart?\n* Do you want to find out the gender in advance, or do your want it to be a surprise? \n* Would you be interested in taking parenting classes or getting books to read together to learn more about being a parent?\n* What kind of things did your parents do that you want to do with our kids?\n* What kind of things did your parents do that you do NOT want to do with our kids?\n* What are your thoughts on disciplining the kids?\n* How religious do you want to raise the kids? \n* How will you feel if the kids are gay/transgender/etc? \n* What do you envision your role as a parent to be like? \n* Is there any activities or interests you hope our kids will enjoy/take part in?\n* What financially to you want to plan for (cars/university/weddings/etc)? What do you want the kids to be responsible for paying for on their own?\n* What are your thoughts on travelling with kids?\n\nThat\u0027s pretty much what I\u0027ve got! Do you have any questions you would add (especially lighter ones)? Is there anything that you wished you had discussed with your partner before having a kid?\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

I have no worries about her in that respect. But at home, well..... It\u0027s a different story. \n\nWe clash lately. A lot. Her attitude towards me and her siblings (2 brothers and 1 sister) leaves an awful lot to be desired. Her moods can turn in a matter of seconds. She talks down to us, shouts, argues, stomps, slams doors, lashes out. The works. I know what it is. It\u0027s her age, her hormones, the start of puberty. I was exactly the same at her age, we\u0027re so similar (maybe that\u0027s part of the problem lol). I know it\u0027s only happening at home because she feels safe enough to do so. She knows (because I tell her regularly) that we will love her no matter what. I try to stay strong and firm in the face of her meltdowns. I talk to her in her calmer times and she tells me she hates it too. She says she can\u0027t stop. I understand. I remember it well. \n\nI\u0027m just really struggling at the moment.

And she, God, not even half asses, more like 1/8th asses everything.  We have taught her how to sweep, how to do litter boxes, how to help with her dishes, multiple times.

And when asked to do anything, even simple, quick things (or they would be if she just did them without the dramatics) she gets this indignant look of ultimate injustice and unfairness on her face.  And if I had a nickle for every time she whined I could just hire a live in housekeeper!  Am I just expecting too much of an about to be 9yo?  I remember having to help with chores as a kid though.  And I would never disrespect and blow off my parents the way she does.  I was no saint, but that was trouble I didn\u0027t wanna bring onto myself, haha.\n\nAnd as for modesty...this kid has little to no concept of appropriateness and boundaries.  She runs around in nothing but underpants a lot, has even done so when the 13yo son of a family friend was over, ran out of her room that way when a former neighbor (60 something year old woman) she hardly knew stopped and gave a hug.  It was all already a little weird and uncomfortable to me, but if it\u0027s just family at home I let it go.  If people are over I tell her to put clothes on.  And not to stand in front of the big living room window at night that way \u003e_\u003e (apartment in the suburbs, plenty, of people coming and going in our little cul-de-sac).  But just this past Friday when her mom stopped by she brought up to us that she thinks it\u0027s time to add some training bras to the back to school shopping.  That she (bio mom) hit puberty at 9, as did her mother, and that she think she\u0027s starting to notice some breast development in my stepdaughter.  I can\u0027t say I see much myself but I wouldn\u0027t say I\u0027m exactly inspecting closely.  But if that\u0027s the point we\u0027re reaching I think she REALLY needs to be taught some boundaries and modesty, needs to start being in the habit of wearing clothes, even around the house.  I might not be such a stickler about it, but frankly she has some behavioral and social issues (we have her in therapy) and needs to be given cut and dry instructions.  If there are gray areas or exceptions the rules go out the window entirely, you give her an inch and she takes about 10 miles.  Am I just being a total prude here feeling that she needs to start being more covered up even when just at home?  I come from a pretty emotionally repressed family, lol.  I have good parents, I was (and am) loved, buy I can\u0027t say I remember many hugs or I love you\u0027s, heck, was never even given a sex or puberty/period talk.  So I\u0027m probably a bit emotionally stunted myself, lol.  Meanwhile that same Friday her mom was telling is this, with stepdaughter in the room, stepdaughter walks up and just grabs and palms her mom\u0027s boobs!  Which is totally weird to me!  She did it once to me a while ago when I was pregnant (baby now 11 months) asking me if I\u0027m gonna pump...which to me says there was more boob talk and touching at her moms (who was also pregnant).  I mean, I get it, she\u0027s young, both mom and stepmom were both preggo (purely coincidental), baby and preggo talk all around her and she was curious.  But I wasn\u0027t ok with that level of physical contact.  Am I just super closed off and prudish or are she and her mom too overly close and physical...or something in between?  Should I be insisting she cover herself or again am I expecting too much?  I\u0027m just concerned with her social issues and lack of boundaries and seemingly to be of the impression that touching and being touched like that is ok that she could wind up in a bad situation.\n\nAny thoughts or personal experience would be super appreciated!",

Our family are all very private. \n\nLast week I was in my room when I heard my mother yell something and slam my brothers door, then go downstairs and speak to my father. My little brother, who is 13, came into my room and looked pale. He said he was caught masturbating (something we also never discuss with one another, so I’m guessing he was feeling anxious). Apparently mom knocked once and opened the door immediately after, catching him standing at his mirror with nothing on the bottom half. \n\nOur father came upstairs and demanded to speak with him privately. He got taken to his room and given the belt. \n\nOur parents have removed the door to his room and his mirror and haven’t put either back yet. My brother has been really quiet since it all happened. He won’t talk to me or anyone else unless it’s a short response and his eyes are lowered with his head down. Our father is now accusing him of being disrespectful by not asking how our days went etc. I’ve tried talking with him privately but it’s like he doesn’t even hear me or he just gives on or two word answers. \n\nI saw him smoking after school yesterday with a rough crowd when he was meant to be at the library and I’ve never seen him with this crowd before so I am concerned he’s now rebelling in some way because of what’s happened. \n\nI’m worried about my brother and not sure how to handle the situation. Other than try and talk to him, which I’ve already been doing, is there anything else I could do? ",

  "selftext": "I\u0027m absolutely blessed with wonderful children. My 1.5 y/o son started walking about 2 months ago and he\u0027s now exploring his environment (and loving it!).\n\nThe problem I\u0027m trying to deal with is touching his sister. At first it was touching her head or back/tummy/shoulder, and sometimes trying to touch her eyes (he no longer does that, thankfully). She any of those happened she would simply move away. Recently he started trying to tickle me and/or his sister. It\u0027s adorable, and it really works (he is becoming pretty good at tickling!). However his sister is now really hating it and has lost all of her patience to the point where he can\u0027t even hug her.\n\nI know in the grand scheme of things this will pass, and I tried talking to her about it. I explained that he\u0027s very young and exploring, and while she\u0027s very smart for her age, she\u0027s just having a hard time accepting it. I told her when they are both older, they could be each other\u0027s best friends, and will be there for each other because we\u0027re family and family are there for each other.\n\nI know this is bothering her on a deep level because on Fridays we sometimes all sleep on the same bed (it\u0027s like a \"bonus\"). Last Friday I had to move her back to her own bed because even though she was asleep, she thought her leg was being touched by her younger brother, and she shook her legs violently to reject his touch (when in fact it was just me covering her legs so she\u0027s not cold).\n\nIt wasn\u0027t always like this - When he was still crawling she used to hug him and kiss him and think he is adorable, but now she\u0027s trying to avoid him at all cost. Is there anything I can do to soften her approach to her younger brother? \n\nI obviously do not want to force her into anything. Especially because she\u0027s a girl, and I want her to know her body is her own and it should never be touched without consent, however he is just a baby and is absolutely innocent and loving (he adores her, and just wants to cuddle/hug sometimes!).",

He doesn’t understand her cues and she ends up crying in her high chair half the time I’m gone. I hate leaving her because it’s 50/50 chance they will have a “good day.” Today I only worked 9am-2pm (he works overnights) and he couldn’t handle it. He goes to bed at 5pm normally, and went at 3pm because he was “fed up.” I hate leaving her with him because of this. \n\nAdvice part: he wants another child!!!! He says in about two years but he half jokes I should get my IUD out now so we can try for a while Incase it takes too long for him. I’ve told him in every way I can think of that one child is enough and we can’t handle anymore. He gets sad and says he’s always wanted more kids. That he would be “disappointed” if our daughter was our only child. It hurts and I don’t want her to eventually hear that. I would love more too, but I would have to be a SAHM for that to happen. \n\nHow can I talk to him about this? Without totally deflating him or being an asshole?",

  "selftext": "I’m a single mom of 4 kids and the oldest is 13. For the past year I’ve been dealing with behaviour issues and I’m at the end of my rope.\n\nHe had a history of hanging out with a bad group of kids who introduced him to drinking and smoking pot. I’ll admit it took me months to catch on to this behaviour— he was a good liar. \n\nWe recently moved away from this neighbourhood and I don’t allow him to see these kids anymore but the damage has been done. \n\nOver the last year I’ve caught him stealing alcohol from his grandparents, and forced him to return the bottles and apologize, which he did, but it happened again months later. \n\nI found homemade bongs in his room to which I grounded him for, and told him about the dangers of drugs yet again.\nThe thing is, his father is an addict and although he hasn’t seen him lately (my ex has severely downspiraled) he knows full well the dangers of drugs but doesn’t seem to care. \n\nI hadn’t found any drugs or bongs so I figured we were in the clear, right up until I found his hidden stash tucked deep away in our backyard when I was doing yard work. He’s been growing his own plant and had a rather large amount bagged up. I was in shock. I nearly called the police on him but didn’t want to because, well, its easier said than done. \n\nI made him burn everything in the fire pit, but he didn’t seem to care. We spoke at length about the dangers of what he’s doing and I no longer trust a word that comes out of his mouth. \nI suggested counseling for dealing with the stress of essentially losing his father but he refuses, and the program here for that requires their consent so I can’t drag him there against his will.\n\nI just don’t know what to do anymore. He’s grounded until the end of time and has no access to electronics but like I said, I’ve run out of trust and don’t know how to get him to stop. School is starting up soon and even though he’s been home for the majority of summer, I know he’ll find himself in trouble with different kids at school. I’m sure of it.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions to kick this behaviour? I worry that because his father was an addict, this drug use will spiral to worse substances over time. I feel like I’ve tried everything but I don’t want to just give up on my son. ",

  "selftext": "I apologize, this is long! Not well written, as I\u0027m pretty upset. I appreciate all of you that would read this and offer your opinions!\n\nTL;DR at end of post.\n\nLittle background, I have 4 kids, oldest (6F) whom I had in a previous relationship prior to my husband. She spends one weekend a month during the school year and 6 weeks of the summer with her dad, stepmom and stepsister, they live about 3 hours away. My daughter\u0027s stepsister is 10 years old and is a super bad influence on my daughter. Everytime she comes home from visiting she always acts out a little, like wild or will do things she\u0027s normally not allowed to at home. It typically takes a couple days to get her back to her normal self and routine. \n\nMy ex would always tell me how bad his step daughter is and how she throws tantrums and how they can\u0027t control her. I\u0027ve seen her act out a few times and not listen to my ex when I go and pick my daughter up. It makes me uncomfortable knowing my daughter is there. My ex is already a pretty bad person/parent but then adding this child they obviously can\u0027t control makes it worse. I feel like my ex only wants to spend time with our daughter to occupy the little monster of a step child and now it\u0027s negatively affecting her. When my daughter is there it\u0027s a free for all household, no rules and everything goes.\n\nMy daughter went to her dad\u0027s for 6 weeks, when I got her back home I could tell something was off.... She wasn\u0027t \"Miss happy go lucky\", she almost seemed down and almost kind of depressed. I kept asking what was wrong, she said she just had a bad couple days. She had told me she fell a few times and didn\u0027t like the long drive. I didn\u0027t think much of it. \n\nA few days go by and she is still not my happy go lucky girl. I\u0027ve noticed her poking at her butt more than usual, more than an itch. Red flag, right? I pull her aside and ask her about it, obviously she shuts down and just says it itches. I didn\u0027t want to pry too much and just told her not to touch it like that. \n\nWell, I come home from work, my husband\u0027s working in his office, I ask him where the kids are and he says in their room. Doors closed.... it\u0027s never closed. I open the door and see one child asleep on the floor, another playing with toys, my 3rd jumping on the bed, and my oldest....sitting there, underwear off and touching herself. I freak out, kick all the little ones out except my 6year old, I take a minute, big breath... And calmly talk to her about what she was doing. I asked her what she was doing, why she was doing it, and who taught her to do it. I also told her to tell me the truth because if she tells the truth she won\u0027t get in trouble, but if she lies there will be grounding and alot of trouble!! She tells me her step sister taught her to do it. I asked if anyone has touched her there before and she told me her stepsister has once! She gave me the details and everything. It was hard for her to tell me, she was crying and all. I had asked her where her stepsister learned it from. Her stepsister apparently learned from her brother, who lives with her dad.\n\nAfter all was said and done I told her I would have to tell her Dad. When I said that she took everything back and said she taught it to herself, she \"thought it\" and \"did it\". She started to deny everything. So now I don\u0027t know what to believe or do! My husband sat down with her and asked her. She again denied her stepsister ever touched her. He then straight asked her, \"when did she touch you?\" Then my daughter told him and he asked how many times. She gave all the same details she told me. \n\nMy husband and I held her, told her we loved her. Told her what happened to her was not okay. \nAnyone have any advice on how to proceed with this?? I don\u0027t even know where to start. I just feel sick that this happened to my child!\n\nTL;DR- my child spent 6 weeks with Dad, stepmom, stepsister. Came home acting different. Said she was sexually abused by stepsister, later denied it. Not sure what to believe or how to handle it.",

But its also giving him ammunition. \"Well they\u0027ve never had vaccines and they\u0027ve never caught any of it because everyone else has it so why do they need it?\" It\u0027s the same argument over and over and over. \n\nWe\u0027re unexpectedly expecting again. I told him I want both kids vaccinated and new baby will be up to par as well and his argument was \"I just don\u0027t trust vaccines\" like why the hell not? He is vaccinated. He\u0027s never delved in any deeper in to researching ACTUAL studies or seeing what these diseases can actually do to a child. He won\u0027t even listen to the baby on youtube with whooping cough because he says \"He doesn\u0027t want to make a decision based on emotion\" but he\u0027s basing his decision on his VAST knowledge of vaccines and diseases and his lack of trust in modern medicine.... Do you see what I\u0027m dealing with here?! He\u0027s being incredibly stubborn and won\u0027t even research the topic. We both get very hot and angry. I would really really appreciate and love some tips or ways to help shed some light on the topic. I don\u0027t want to go behind his back and get the younger two vaccinated without his consent. The older one isn\u0027t biologically mine so I\u0027m absolutely not taking her without his consent. Sigh...... ",

  "title": "Complaints and Honesty Do Not Equal Regret.",
  "selftext": "So I come from a situation that seems to be a bit unusual. I come from a family that very strongly argued against getting married and having kids. I still remember my mom telling me she loved me and my sister but that we basically destroyed her financially and sucked up all her time. (Untrue on the time front as she was never around for a long time but that\u0027s a whole different story)\n\nWell, I met a perfect guy, got married, and we had a kid. The kid came earlier than we were really planning, birth control failed, but I love him to pieces and I honestly love the life I have with my family.\n\nBut any time I make any freaking comment on anything annoying I get looks or sometimes even bold enough questioners to ask if I regret it. People seem to be waiting for me to fail, to admit I was a stupid pos and I regret my life as it is now.\n\nIt\u0027s equal parts infuriating and heartbreaking honestly. It\u0027s disgusting someone would look at honesty about kids being kind of a pain sometimes as me regretting having my son. I can think he\u0027s the best little guy to ever live and love him to pieces while also acknowledging it sucks when he wakes up five times in one night or that having a kid kind of limits you financially. It\u0027s not like I even actively complain I just answer questions honestly.\n\n\"How has your day been EthanEpiale?\"\n\n\"Oh it\u0027s been pretty good. Kiddo slept kinda bad so we\u0027re tired, but we\u0027ve been coloring with crayons and it\u0027s honestly adorable.\"\n\nAnd then the look of the snide comments come out.\n\nPeople don\u0027t act like you regret your entire career if you complain about work constantly, why does one passing remark about a kid being difficult mean I\u0027ve failed as a parent or regret it all? I feel like I can\u0027t talk to people. Hell I get this even with honest advice. I was explaining pregnancy complications to a friend who asked and got from another friend overhearing.\n\n\"Wow, you must hate your kid.\"\n\nSorry pregnancy sometimes involves puking for months on end, or ripping from vag to ass and being willing to share that with a friend so she doesn\u0027t go in thinking pregnancy will be nothing but rainbows and sunshine. It\u0027s part of life. Sometimes you have to suffer long sleepless study nights and work two jobs to male school work, doesn\u0027t mean you hate your degree or wish you\u0027d never tried for it.\n\nIDK this is rant-y. I\u0027m just so sick of the judgment surrounding not acting like parenthood is 100% Pinterest lunches, baby giggles, and glowing womanhood. Some people do regret having their kids, and my heart genuinely goes put to those people, but acknowledging bad times along with all the good doesn\u0027t mean your family was a mistake.",

  "title": "I worry my kids are codependent and toxic towards each other and do not know how to address it",
  "selftext": "So I wasn\u0027t the best mother and I\u0027m trying to fix things. My kids are used to taking care of themselves I\u0027m sober now but I was at best a high functioning alcoholic. I\u0027ve always suspected they had a hive mind/pack mentality something I\u0027ve come to realize today is while that\u0027s how they coped with a dysfunctional upbringing it\u0027s not exactly healthy. I blame myself and my soon to be abusive ex husband\n\nMy kids are all the same  age (15) and one of my daughter\u0027s who I\u0027ll refer to as Winter informed me that her sister who I\u0027ll refer to as Summer has an unhealthy attachment to their brother. She said that Summer will often stick to her brother like glue.\n\nSummer and Winter both have issues Summer focuses on her looks and I learned she acts like a \"bimbo\" (Winter\u0027s words not mine) despite being very smart because of cruel things her father has said over years. Winter who I used to think was a straight A student has been cheating for years because she\u0027s afraid of ending up like me and her sister.\n\nA few days after we moved into our new place I found out all of that and my children and I have been in therapy but now Winter has told me this about her sister. However it\u0027s clear Winter has mixed feelings about her sister I think she feels inferior to her sister especially now that it\u0027s out that Winter is a cheater. My daughters resent each other  but are also possessive of each other. It\u0027s due to their father\u0027s emotional abuse (something that came out during counseling/therapy) Summer always as Winter put it \"comes in first\" and she wanted to beat her at something. \n\nSummer also seems to bully Winter I think for some reason she puts her sister down because Summer is for whatever reason threatened by her sister. I think it\u0027s best summed up as an unhealthy rivalry. Summer has said \"I have to be better than her.\" and Winter has said \"I will be better than her.\"\n\nI don\u0027t really know how to explain it Summer is ashamed to be known for her smarts so she focuses on materialistic things. Winter is ashamed of her looks so she fakes being smarter than she really is. I think they both are whether they know it or not fighting over their father\u0027s love and now with him not around they are focusing on their brother.\n\nI mean I don\u0027t know what to say to them I have them all seeing a professional but I don\u0027t know how to handle or talk to them because it\u0027s becoming clear they have deep scars. They are just starting to open up to me and letting me in and I don\u0027t know how to prepare for however I might react because I\u0027m getting the sense their problems run deep and they are afraid of how I might react if they do fully open up.\n\nI also don\u0027t know how to approach Summer about this unhealthy attachment because I\u0027m not sure if even she\u0027s aware of it or if she is and is likely deeply secretly ashamed but since Winter told me (yesterday) it\u0027s become apparent that Summer is clingy. I also don\u0027t know if Winter is just causing trouble for Summer so I don\u0027t want to over react.\n\nJust please tell me I\u0027m wrong and I\u0027m making something out of nothing Summer spends lots of time with her brother. She is very judgmental about his girlfriends. She gets mad when he confides in me or her sister an she seems sad when he doesn\u0027t want to spend time with her. I want to believe it\u0027s just regular codependency that with more therapy will be resolved but I worry it\u0027s more extreme.\n\nHow do I approach this? Should I approach this outside of therapy/counseling?",

  "title": "Is Tickling Wrong? Today my brother in law shamed me for tickling my toddler, and I don\u0027t know what to think of it.",
  "selftext": "We were sitting on the couch watching a show, when my toddler ran up to me and flopped himself down beside me.  \"Tickles!\" he shouted.  I obliged and tickled his belly, and he had a giggle fit.  I thought nothing of it, and went back to watching the show with my toddler cuddled up to me.\n\nMy brother in law, who doesn\u0027t usually visit, recoiled and asked me what I was doing.  I looked at him confused, and said that I was tickled my son.  He said that it was wrong.  His daughter was there, who\u0027s the same age as my son, and he went on to say that he would never dream of tickling her belly, and that he has taught her better than to ask for that.  She knows that it would be wrong for a grown man to touch her belly, and my son should know better than to let a grown woman touch his belly, too.  He really strongly implied that I was behaving like a pedophile for just tickling my son\u0027s belly at his request and making him laugh.  He also seemed to be implying that it would be fine if it was a child of the same sex, and what makes it wrong is that it\u0027s an opposite sex child.\n\nHe is very religious, so I\u0027m thinking that may be part of where his views are coming from.  He seemed quite sincere and does have a very hands-off approach with his daughter.  He said that he won\u0027t even help her wash in the tub because seeing her naked would be wrong.  I thought this was bizarre because toddlers still need some help sometimes.  I\u0027m pretty sure he\u0027s completely out to lunch here, but does anyone actually think it\u0027s wrong to tickle your child\u0027s belly?  He was implying that there\u0027s a sexual connotation to the act of tickling and helping them wash in the tub, which I completely disagree with.  I\u0027m just kind of upset that now there\u0027s a member of my family who thinks I\u0027m a pedo because I tickle my son.",

  "title": "Daughter might be gay/bisexual and has feelings for her best friend.",
  "selftext": "Hey guys.  I\u0027m awful at keeping it relevent, so this will be long and scattered, forgive me.\n\n So recently my 11 year old daughter (D1) confided in my other daughter(D2) that she thinks she might be gay, because she has a crush on her best friend (also female, obviously). She said that D1 didn\u0027t want me or her father or anyone else to know, but that she (D2) was concerned because D1 had been crying about it and that she comforted her and offered her support, but that she felt a little out of her depth, so she felt that she should tell me anyway so that I could offer my support as well.\n\n Now, I hate that I even have to clarify, but I have *no* issue with this, and I\u0027ve made it very clear to all five of my children that I\u0027m very accepting and supportive of LGBT and that they should be as well. We have a very close family friend that\u0027s gay and we spend a lot of time with her and her gf (sleepovers, holidays, vacations etc), so while I was a bit surprised to hear that she might be gay, I was *very* surprised that she was upset and worried about how we would react. So I did end up discussing it with her, mostly because I didn\u0027t want her to feel alone with it. \n\nShe did seem confused about her feelings. She\u0027s had crushes on boys before and when I asked her if she likes other girls or just this girl in particular, she said just the one girl. I\u0027m wondering if she\u0027s confusing attachment with attraction or if I could be way off base and confusing her even more. I told her that she\u0027s very young and still developing, but that it\u0027s very normal at her age to start exploring her feelings and that whatever she does or *is*, we support her fully and love her and definitely encourage her to be true to herself. \n\nI feel like the only reason she\u0027s apprehensive about her feelings is because we live in the deep south, in a very, *very* small rural town. Everyone is extremely conservative and everything is centered around church (we don\u0027t attend church ourselves, so we\u0027re already a bit set apart from everyone else). I know that she goes to school and church with her friends and hears things that don\u0027t mesh with what I\u0027ve tried to instill in her at home, but there\u0027s really not much I can do about that besides remain steadfast in my morals and hope that she\u0027ll emulate that. \n\nI guess I\u0027m just hoping that I\u0027ve said and done the right things thus far. Any advice on how I can be more supportive without being pushy? I haven\u0027t brought the subject up with her again as I felt like I did a good job of making her feel safe, but I want to give her space to figure out and be positive of what she really feels in the meantime. I do want to be more prepared when she does decide to come to me about it.\n\nAnother issue I\u0027m looking for advice about is the best friend situation. I\u0027m not really sure how to navigate around the feelings and the actual time they spend together. I\u0027m very aware that they\u0027re only 11 and I\u0027m not concerened at all about anything actually sexual happening, but I\u0027m not really sure how I feel about sleepovers. I wouldn\u0027t let my other daughters have a sleepover with boys that they have crushes on at this age, and I feel like it would be a double standard to let D1 have sleepovers with someone she\u0027s attracted to. That\u0027s really the only issue, no concern about anything inappropriate happening, just concerm for breaking a rule I\u0027ve always been adamant about.\n\nI\u0027m not sure if I\u0027m being completely ridiculous about this or if it\u0027s a valid concern. I\u0027m hesitant to eliminate sleepovers with the girl because I feel like it would make my daughter apprehensive about sharing her feelings with me in the future and it would leave the best friend and her mom wondering what happened.\n\n This is all new territory for me and I just don\u0027t know how things work or what\u0027s okay and what\u0027s not, and just boundaries in general. Any advice from parents in similar situations? Thanks!\n\n\n\n ",

They are 21 months apart. \n\nMy husband and I have decided that we are going to start trying to conceive baby number 3. We don\u0027t want kids far apart in age so we are going to stick with 2 if I am not pregnant by the end of this year. That means my daughter will be between 4 and 4.5 and my son will be between 2 and 3 when the baby would be born. If the baby is a boy then we can just bunk him with my son. We don\u0027t know what to do if the baby is a girl. \n\nI feel like 4 or 5 years is a big age difference for kids to be sharing a room. They\u0027ll be on totally different schedules and the oldest will be school aged when the baby would still be waking through the night. I think it would make more sense to put the older two together for a few years but then we have a boy and girl sharing a room. How long would that go on for? My husband doesn\u0027t think it\u0027s a big deal. He shared with his sister until he was 10 and she was 11 before sharing with his older brother.

I know it isn\u0027t illegal but don\u0027t want teachers overhearing and calling about something like that. Is there anything inappropriate about opposite sex siblings sharing that we are missing?

  "selftext": "Hello as the tittle says. I have been with my gf for almost 3 years \u0026 she is having some issues with her ex which is her childs father. He was having their child stay for a week \u0026 he caused some issues while the child was there so my gf has basically given him a telling off \u0026 by the sounds of it he is not taking it well \u0026 his most recent attempt at deflecting the main issue is to say that it\u0027s illegal for me to sleep in the same bed as his daughter who is 6 years old. I am not too happy about getting brought into this to be honest but I would like some advice whether it is a problem? I am pretty certain that unless I was a registered paedophile or something or we were having sex next to her then there is nothing illegal about it?",

To an outsider, I will be bluntly honest and admit: yes, this seems unhealthy. I am aware that there are lots of people on reddit that support extended co-sleeping, so perhaps others will disagree with me. \n\nLegally speaking, I would think that there is nothing illegal about co-sleeping. But I also think that the optics of this situation are pretty terrible for you, and a false accusation can ruin your life. Personally, I do not think this is a battle you should be fighting.",

  "title": "Is this family a bad influence on my daughter or is it me?",
  "selftext": "My 16 year old daughter and i have issues. Im a single mother, i have next to no support and i work. In the past year I\u0027ve had my marriage fall apart (not my daughter\u0027s father, i was remarried) in a very painful and difficult way. Then my daughter witnessed a family freind sexually assault a little girl, which we\u0027ve become involved with the police and DCP, Aussie CPS, affidavits have been written etc. My daughter also went through bullying at school last year. So its been an awful time for both of us in particular my daughter. She has begged me to be home schooled like her freind but because i work, the education department won\u0027t allow it. They have only given us the option of a private college with programs designed for kids going through difficult stuff. In Australia kids have to be engaged in education and training until 12th grade, she is in 10th. Not sending her to some form of schooling is illegal and considered child neglect.\n\nShe spends a lot of time with her freind who is being home schooled, lets call her Sarah. She\u0027s a lovely girl with her own issues, she also went through bullying and her mum, lets call her Jessica, has recently left her father. Apparently there was domestic violence, he was unfaithful and even drugged her to go and see his mistress.\n\nSarah and Jessica have been there for my daughter a lot, Jessica is a stay at home mum and they all hang out a lot together. Jessica offered to home school my daughter for me but the rules say no, i have to, and as i mentioned, i work and am not in a position to live off welfare. Also, i did not finish school so I\u0027m not educated enough to educate her. Every time my daughter stays there she gets angry at me that she can\u0027t home school and that i don\u0027t spend enough time with her. Its true, i dont, between work and all the stress ive been under its hard. I suffer from depression, yes im getting help, but to cope with work and all this school and legal stuff i do spend a lotof time alone. Much of the time we do spend together she will bring up all the things she resents about me and i just shut down because im so stressed. Im doing my best but its not enough. I feel like Jessica and sarah are so supportive that they are fuelling these resentments even if they aren\u0027t intending to. \n\nSince Jessica left her husband, she has been driving around looking for her husband, to catch him with his mistress. She takes my daughter and her daughter sarah along on these excursions, often late at night. My daughter loves the excitement and drama of it of it. Recently her iphone screen got damaged while they were running back to their car in case he saw them. Cost me nearly  $200 to fix. I don\u0027t have a high paid job. It had only been repaired a few weeks prior. I dont know how she expects me to quit my job, go on unemployment and maintain her iphone, buy her converse sneakers, pay for her internet, and provide her with all the stuff she wants. \n\nI guess my concern is, i feel that her freinds environment is not helping our situation. She just seems so much more resentful when she\u0027s been there that im not in a position to stay home and home school her. \n\nAlso, i feel that with all that is going on in my daughter\u0027s life that this following the violent ex husband is not healthy, or safe! Jessica insists that he\u0027d never do anything while my daughter and sarah are there but this is a man who allegedly drugged his wife with ketamine! If he is so dangerous and she is scared of him, why would she go out at night and stalk him? I\u0027ve had a drama queen freind before who claimed domestic violence and acted similarly. As opposed to my sister who left her hubby due to DV and avoided him like the plague, would not engage with him, etc. Im concerned about Jessicas state of mind if she is engaging in this risky behavior, and im starting to think it\u0027s a bad influence on my daughter. \n\nAdvice and thoughts please.",

  "selftext": "Long story short: I am 36, have been with my partner for about 3 years and we are \"basically\" married in that we live as married and committed couple, we just haven\u0027t really bothered with shelling out for engagement rings and getting married because it just doesn\u0027t feel necessary to us. \n\nI am unexpectedly pregnant (birth control failure). \n\nI don\u0027t know whether to keep it or not. I am someone never wanted kids and always wanted to travel. I do LIKE kids, but I dislike babies/toddlers, and I think that is the thing that really puts me off the idea of having a child. There is a joke in my family that RadiantHedgehog doesn\u0027t want to be within 20 feet of you until you are about 3, then she adores you. I am also terrified and grossed out by the idea of pregnancy and birth and that is a huge reason I said I never wanted kids. I was only half joking when I told my mum I\u0027d consider being a parent if a stork could deliver me a 4 year old I don\u0027t have to birth or toilet train. \n\nI am basically at the \"now or never\" point in my life where I either have kids or I don\u0027t and have to make the decision.\n\nMe partner and I have decent, but not great jobs. He went to University later in life so is behind career wise, while I was someone whose career basically got killed be the recession - tons of companies had to let people go and went on hiring freezes, and I lost about 5-6 years of career development to being unemployed or working in crappy retail jobs and have only just been in a good job again for about 4 years now, but I am behind. I traveled with my earnings from my retail jobs, rather than saving a lot, which I don\u0027t regret, but probably is something I probably should have thought through more. \n\nThe good news is we are in Europe and we don\u0027t have American style student debt, there is social security that helps, government funded health care etc. \n\nSo. I don\u0027t know what to do. \n\n(I haven\u0027t told my partner yet, because I feel like this is my body and my decision), \n\nSo many people tell me how wonderful parenting is and how I will never regret having a kid and it will be the best thing I ever do with my life. And I have no doubt it would be lovely in many ways if I were to have a child.\n\nBut 36 years on this planet has taught me something - that there are two sides to every story, and pros/cons to every decisions. \n\nSo I want to hear the other side. Tell me why I *shouldn\u0027t* have a kid. Tell me why if I keep this pregnancy, I will sit in front of a therapist one day and cry that becoming a mother was a mistake and that I should have had the abortion. Tell me the worst that can happen. Give me your horror stories. Basically, talk me out of it. So many people will try and talk me into it if they know/find out. I\u0027ve heard it all from family members try and talk me into having kids. So talk me out of it. Give me the other side of the story. \n\nI haven\u0027t made my mind up yet about whether I will continue the pregnancy or not.

I can’t sleep or eat thinking some type of sexual trauma happened to my little girl that would make her act out like this. \n\nEver since she was little I have checked in on her after her bed time to ensure she is asleep. Last week around 10pm I opened the door without knocking because the light was on and I could see this under the door. I saw her nude and on top of my girlfriends son who was spending the night while his mother was out of town. As soon as I opened the door she jumped off of him and covered herself up and I told her to get dressed and go to my room and not leave. My girlfriends son honestly just seemed scared. \n\nI immediately called her and tried to explain what happened so she would come back home, but she said I was over reacting and didn’t come back until yesterday. I had sent my daughter to stay with her mother, who I also told about the incident, and she said this was my fault because I give her freedom. \n\n(Which I don’t... I don’t let her have a cell phone, I won’t get her an iPad, a laptop, or any of the electronics she’s asked for. All she has is a leapfrog tablet. And I check the WiFi to make sure it’s only been enabled on my personal devices) \n\nWhen my girlfriend came back we talked to our children individually about what happened and her son says my daughter  forced him. He said he didn’t want to take his clothes off and she bribed him with ice cream. I asked her if this was true and she just shrugged. I asked her if someone else had touched her like that and she said no. I asked if she saw that on a video somewhere and she said yes, all of the girls on her soccer team were watching a video like that a few months ago. \n\nI’ve already reached out to child psychologists but they’re all extremely expensive and my health insurance does not cover it. I’m scared to even leave her alone or with other children or God forbid a grown man. I wanted to take her off the soccer roster but she screamed and told me she would die if I did and now I scared of doing anything. Her mother chose yesterday to say that she has a boyfriend who has a child with a woman who’s only 19, and the child is 6. But our daughter has not met him yet. So I do not want her staying with her mother or going over there without my supervision. \n\nTL;DR my child has discovered sex at a extremely early age, I seem to be the only one taking it seriously, and I do not know what to do next.

  "selftext": "We had a baby 9 months ago, totally planned, no regrets on either side as far as I can tell--he adores her.\n\nNot a throwaway, so here it goes.\n\nMy husband and I haven\u0027t had sex for well over a year. While pregnant, it wasn\u0027t comfortable for me, and while I didn\u0027t say anything, he took notice, so no sex after about 4-5 months into pregnancy.\n\nNow that we have a nine month old baby, we have had sex once, when he was very drunk. Didn\u0027t get anywhere, despite his efforts. I was interested in every way, as soon as the doctor cleared me, at six weeks post partum. \n\nHe has since initiated three times: - I was asleep. Apparently I indicated no, don\u0027t remember. I was literally asleep. - I was working from home, and he knew I couldn\u0027t just step away. - I was on my period for the first time after the baby. \"Oh right, you told me, never mind\" \n\nHe\u0027s very stressed due to a new business and presumably the baby. I\u0027m not forcing the issue. He brought up having another baby \"very soon\".\n\nI\u0027ve tried to initiate sex a few (about a dozen in the last 8 months) times, and was either politely shut down (most common) or completely ignored (less common). I don\u0027t want to be a nuisance, either.\n\nI\u0027m 99.9% certain he\u0027s not cheating, or lost attraction to me. I look the same as I did before the baby, weight and looks wise. \n\nWe talked about this before. He was diagnosed with genital warts while I was very very pregnant, which is somewhat in line, time wise, with when we became exclusive. As in, he was having sex before we started our official relationship, and the doctor said he was on the later end of genital warts coming up with that said. I tested as soon as he told me, and all tests showed negative.\n\nHe told me that the genital warts, along with a pervious similar diagnosis of mouth Herpes, which I also tested negative against, is messing with him. I\u0027ve told him every time that it\u0027s fine, because here we are and we deal with this together now.\n\nSo his perspective is that the genital warts has killed his deride for sex. I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s the whole story, whether he knows it or not, since we had a baby and opened a new business. It\u0027s stressful, I recognize that. I\u0027m not pressuring him into sex, even though he knows that we both understand that we aren\u0027t having any, especially since he\u0027s talking about another baby, but is choosing the most inconvenient times, on purpose or not.\n\nI asked if he\u0027d be willing to see a therapist, and he said, \"I guess why not\", which is more than I expected, but it\u0027s up to me now, because he won\u0027t seek it out.\n\nI was planning to talk to him during a \"good\" time. Ask him if he wants me to initiate sex, or if that makes it worse. Ask him if his STI diagnosis is still having him feel like he shouldn\u0027t, because I understand and accept it. Ask him if I should just go ahead and book an appointment with a therapist, or if he was just agreeing with me.\n\nWhat should I say? I\u0027m not going anywhere, I have all the time in the world. I want everyone to be happy, and hell, if he said we weren\u0027t to ever have sex again for some reason, I\u0027d accept that and never have sex again. But we went from every 1-2 days to nothing in over a year, and I don\u0027t know what do. Does my conversation starter make sense? Anything to remove or add?\n\nTl;Dr have a conversation piece for my husband, not sure if it\u0027s the right approach",

Even if its unpaid, it could give you a little trial run of 1 income budgeting and SAHMing.\n\nWhatever you decide, you\u0027ll rock it!",

He is high functioning (verbal, strong academically, etc.) but has behavioral, emotional and social difficulties. He is an only child, to a happily married mom and dad who, while we are far from financially “well to do,” have been able to generally spoil him with things (and experiences) that we certainly didn’t have growing up. I wouldn’t go so far as to say he is entitled or believes things are owed to him in some way but, he has rarely in his life had to experience what it is like to want something badly and not, eventually, have it. Within reason of course. \n\nAs is true of most kids, he has a hard time seeing the forest from the trees. In short, he knows there are folks out there that certainly don’t have it as good as he does, he knows there are kids with nothing, some not even with a home, but, he doesn’t quite “get it” because he’s never seen it first hand. He has, on many occasions, gotten a sharp tongue and thought it was in some way a threat to us to say he’d rather live on the streets than with us. Oh, did I mention he’s going through puberty? (LOL) It doesn’t matter how much we explain just how good he has it. Without a point of reference, he just doesn’t see that bigger picture. \n\nAt the beginning of the year he mentioned his resolution was to volunteer at a soup kitchen. While I loved the idea, it doesn’t seem those near us allow this (at his age) or have a program that would support him being able to do more than just stand there, not really seeing more than behind the scenes at a serving station. I would really love to find some volunteer opportunities for him that could both benefit him from the perspective of helping others, as well as getting a glimpse into how good he really does have it. Something with kids would be great. The bottom line is though... I don’t even know where to start. I don’t have any ideas beyond things I’ve personally vested my community time in (which aren’t in this type of area). So, I’m here to ask... does anyone have their kids involved in a program I could look into? Any ideas for volunteer opportunities that might not be so obvious? I’d love any advice you can offer!",

  "selftext": "Posted on relationships sub but got locked. A mod adviced to post here.\n\nI\u0027m asking for advice here because I don\u0027t want anyone I know or knows my daughter to know any of this. For the record, my husband died of cancer when Amy was 2 years old.\n\nMy daughter Amy has been dating her boyfriend Harry for about 9 months. I don\u0027t know the specifics about how they met, I think it was through mutual friends. As far as I know, this is Amy\u0027s first serious relationship.\n\nHarry is the sweetest joung man I\u0027ve ever met. I met him a few days before Halloween last year when he was helping Amy with some homework. He introduced himself and was really polite (and really nervous), and he just seemed really nice, made an effort to talk to me and all that. Amy told me he\u0027s an engineering student like herself, and really smart. He stayed for dinner and left after. I asked Amy if she liked him and she said they had been going out for two months or so.\n\nI\u0027ve been seeing Harry around the house since, and I really like him. He\u0027s smart and nice and I think he really cares for Amy. He\u0027s always helping her with homework, gives her small gifts, I\u0027ve overheard some bits of conversation, and well, I can see the way he looks at her. I know that\u0027s not of my business and aside from asking a few questions and a talk here and there (safe sex, boundaries, all that), I didn\u0027t pry. I\u0027m just happy that he treats my daughter with respect and love.\n\nThat said, I\u0027ve noticed something in the last four months or so. Of course this is from an outside perspective and I\u0027m missing a lot of details, but I think my daughter is treating Harry really bad, even abusing him. The first time I noticed something, they were watching a movie on the couch. I try to give them space so usually I go to the study or my bedroom, or go out. I was walking by the living room and I heard Harry asking Amy something and Amy said \"f*** off, you are so annoying\". I don\u0027t think the tone was that of banter. Since then, there have been more instances of this behaviour. Harry saying something and Amy telling him to f*** off or to shut up, calling him idiot, stupid, ugly, disgusting... I don\u0027t know how did this happen, Amy has NEVER shown any behaviour like this. She doesn\u0027t treat her friends like this.\n\nI admit that since I started noticing this, I have eavesdropped a few conversations between them, and there\u0027s nothing Harry says to set Amy off, I\u0027ve heard her calling him a f***ing loser just because Harry asked her to go out on a saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry keeps being sweet and nice to her, even more than when I first met him. I haven\u0027t even heard him cursing, much less insulting Amy (I would kick him out in a heartbeat), so either he\u0027s really good at hiding it, or he\u0027s not doing it at all.\n\nI don\u0027t know if I should say something. On the one hand, Amy is my daughter and I feel like I should side with her and I don\u0027t know the whole story. On the other, as far as I know Harry has done nothing to diserve this kind of treatment and I sorry for him.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nTLDR: Daughter\u0027s boyfriend is really nice to her and me, daughter treats him awful.",

Last summer puberty happened seemingly overnight. She is no longer overweight, her body matured and she is quite stunning. She became friends with the only crowd that would have her- the “bad” kids. Her behavior went downhill fast. She has “boyfriends” she is not permitted to see these boys outside of school but they say “I love you” and all that jazz. Her grades have plummeted. She was consistently straight A’s, honor roll....not anymore. She was caught twice and suspended twice with the group “vaping” at school. \n\nMy parents bought her a brand new Iphone 7 behind my back and I know this is a HUGE problem. Parental controls are BS, and Instagram is the devil. \n\nI think maybe pulling her out of the current school district might be a solution, but she is terrified at the prospect. The only other option is a district with about 200 kids TOTAL...she says her “group” has kids in that district too.  \n\nWe just began counseling and she told the counselor that while she knows these kids aren’t good, she wants to develop the strength to resist peer pressure and be the good influence for them. I think we all know how that ends. \n\nI’m fairly terrified. I know that if I don’t make some serious corrections she is headed for a life of suffering. \n\nShe hasn’t had the ideal upbringing.

  "selftext": "My 9.5 year old son became very angry and annoyed because I was taking pictures of him \"without permission\". Specifically in this situation when he was going out on the boat with 5 other family members during vacation 2 weeks ago.\n\nHe began crying and stomping and said that he didn\u0027t want to be in any pictures ever without giving permission and that I didn\u0027t ask him if I could take any. I cannot fathom ever even thinking of telling my mother at that age that I demanded to have given full permission to take family photos that would be just for family eyes (not social media).\n\nSo, in the end, very frustrated by his tantrum I told him if he didn\u0027t want to be in the picture he could duck down in the boat (it was already off the dock so him getting off wasn\u0027t an option) so everyone else could have a picture for their memories. He did so, but he was miserable all evening afterwards and so was I. \n\nI teach consent for physical contact to all my kids and so I see where he\u0027s coming from but these are family photos and I think he\u0027ll regret not having candid shots to look back on when he\u0027s an adult. I also feel (and I may be way off) that this is just one of those parenting vetoe moments. I asked him later to explain his reason...he simply said \"people shouldn\u0027t take pictures without asking and I was in a bad mood\". The bad mood was because he didn\u0027t want to wear the lifejacket.\n\nI\u0027d appreciate any constructive feedback! TIA.",

She could whine about  not wanting to be in the picture and then everyone would beg, bribe, tell her how pretty she was, etc, and she got to hold up a whole massive group of people and draw as much attention to herself as possible (this is still her personality.  She is that girl covered in glitter, doing cartwheels, and singing loudly while going OH MY GOD YOU GUYS WHY IS EVERYONE LOOKING AT ME, GOD).  I stared saying fine, step out, and taking pictures of everyone else.  Guess who ended up front and center in all the pictures?  For her it was all about attention seeking.\n\nAlso, I think sometimes kids take a stand on something that\u0027s not very meaningful to them and then they don\u0027t know how to back down so saying ok, just step out, and not making a big deal of it allows them to cool off and think it over and then change their minds without calling too much attention to it.  They don\u0027t get so caught up in the argument that they can\u0027t change their minds.",

Until we did her smash cake… Evidently she must be allergic to some of the die that the bakery used to create the icing color, because she almost instantly broke out in hives. Including all around her eyes. Luckily it wasn’t more serious than that. I made sure to get all the icing off of her hands and we gave her some Benadryl. The hives quickly subsided after that. But it scared me half to death. \n\nI think we’re going to talk to her pediatrician Monday at her one year well visit about getting her an allergy test. Because this whole trying new things and just hoping she’s not allergic to them doesn’t really fly for me anymore. It seems too risky. I’d rather just go ahead and know what I need to avoid with her right now instead of waiting until she has a nasty reaction. \n\nI feel so bad that her own smash cake made her sick. No parent wants that to happen at their kid’s first birthday party. And no one else wanted the cake, so we ended up just throwing away this beautiful little $17 birthday cake that had barely been touched ( all my daughter did was poke her finger in it a total of maybe 3 times).

The idea of teaching a little one about the world seems appealing, but I\u0027m confused on this desire to have kids.\n\nThe only analogy I think that makes sense is about individual\u0027s attraction. I don\u0027t have attractions to the same sex much like I imagine homosexual individuals know they don\u0027t have attraction to the opposite sex. I think this is similar to my feelings about reproducing, but I\u0027m not sure.\n\nHow were you guy\u0027s feelings before having kids? Always knew? Kinda convinced about the decision?

  "selftext": "Hey so here\u0027s some context. I\u0027m on birth control so my period comes pretty consistently each month. My hubs and I have been apart for about a week short of two months due to a work trip. He left in late April so that was that was the very latest it could have happened. \n\nAfter he left I got my period in the middle to early of May, it wasn\u0027t very consistent with how it usually is but I didn\u0027t make a big deal about it. Anyways I was spending time with his Russian family and I drank during the time I was there WAY more than I usually do. Maybe twice a week at least? And a lot. I\u0027ve been drinking from late April until now much more than usual (like I said maybe 1-3 times per week since he\u0027s been gone) and I always get a pretty good buzz going. \n\nAnyways here\u0027s my issue now, I started my birth control possibly 1-1.5 weeks LATE because I didn\u0027t have anyone to take me so I could refill my BC. I just finished my full cycle of 3 weeks and my period should have come yesterday and it\u0027s not here. Since he has been gone since late April if I am pregnant I would be at least almost 2 months pregnant at the very LEAST and I\u0027ve been boozing much more the whole time since I got my period in May... \n\nMy questions are \n\n1. If I am pregnant how much damage have I done? I know there\u0027s a grace period with alcohol but 2 months seems a little long.... the last time I was pregnant I found out as soon as humanly possible so I\u0027m just really worried now.\n\n2. If anyone else has had a similar situation to me did you notice anything different about when you drank? The last two weeks alcohol hasn\u0027t been hitting me very much at all even when I drink a lot. I thought maybe my tolerance went up but maybe there\u0027s a connection to being pregnant and drinking. \n\nWith that being said I know I\u0027m only two days late but now that I\u0027m aware this might actually be an issue I won\u0027t touch anything bad for me or potential maybe baby.

  "selftext": "Warning - long post! \nHi guys, I need to have a big vent and would like some advice. I\u0027ve recently had my relationship break down and have had to shift house with my daughter (I\u0027ll call her E.) We moved in with a couple, the father had just gotten full custody of his son (I\u0027ll refer to him as C) and we all moved into a big house. The deal was that I can live with them for cheap rent if I can get C ready and to school in the mornings (both dad and step mum start work at 6-7am) and look after him in the afternoon until his father finishes work.\n We\u0027ve been living in the house for one month now. There\u0027s already a multitude of problematic behavior coming from C. \n\n(Btw, C is 7yo and E is 4yo) Here is some things C is doing:\n-making inappropriate sexual jokes to E\n-telling E to shut up, that she\u0027s annoying, calling her names, bossing her around etc\n-stealing E\u0027s toys and retorting \"sharing is caring\" when told to give them back\n-kicking, punching and slapping E and other kids at school \n-Taking his clothes off and dancing and bouncing around the house, pushing his bottom and private parts into people\u0027s faces\n-Sneaking into E\u0027s bedroom at night, preventing her for sleeping\n-Telling E that a bad man is going to come into her bedroom at night and hurt her.\n- Making up stories about being a ninja assassin to scare E\n- constantly making fart noises, and flashing his bottom at people, particularly E.\n- back chatting and being disrespectful to adults\n- yelling for no reason\n- laughing in E\u0027s face and deliberately winding her up when she asks him to leave her alone\n- bragging about being much older, bigger and smarter than E and berating her for being too little.\n- deliberately tipping food and water onto the floor\n-Threatening to push E over the balcony, out of the windows, threatening to rape her\n-swearing at me, his teachers, his parents and toys/games\n-pushing E when she walks past him and laughing when she gets upset\n-trying to peep under the door while E or myself are using the bathroom or are in our bedrooms.\n-Throwing toys, clothes, cups, plates, and other people\u0027s possessions because he thinks it\u0027s funny\n-stealing and hiding things that don\u0027t belong to him\n-disrespecting privacy, he barges in to my bedroom and starts going through my things and swears at me when I tell him to leave.\n-running out of the house and down the street on the road when he doesn\u0027t get his own way\n-sitting in the middle of the road when he is angry and saying he is going to get hit by a car because he wants to die.\n-trying to jump on the neighbours car and smash the windscreen\n-trying to show E pornography\n-trying to punish E when he feels like she has don\u0027t something wrong, this can range from trying to take her toys away to physically hurting her\n\nC\u0027s parents are fully aware of how he\u0027s been behaving. We have talked about it several times. The step mother is really supportive and always backs me up, but the father doesn\u0027t always take me seriously, since C is always on \"his best behaviour\" around him.\n His mother had him on ADHD medication, then the Paternal grandmother took over guardianship for a few months and (stupidly) took him off the meds and went to a doctor who undiagnosed him. C has had a rough start with life and hasn\u0027t had much routine or consistency. His bio mother is a drug addict, and C has been witness to her being raped and beaten. He has lived around other kids before, and had similar issues. He used to be homeschooled. His bio mum\u0027s partner was abusive towards him and C was regularly being babysat by other friends and family. The mother has put it in the parenting agreement that C is not to see any councillors or psychologists that she hasn\u0027t personally met and has approved of (and naturally shes refusing to meet with anyone, because she doesn\u0027t want the truth of her abuse to come out and she doesn\u0027t want to go to jail) C\u0027s father is trying to get this repealed with his lawyer, but things are moving very slowly.\n\nThe father and step mum intervene whenever they can to correct C\u0027s behaviour. They have both been talking about how they wish they could just give C a good smack in the butt when he is misbehaving, but they won\u0027t because CPS is still involved and we live in a country where it is illegal to hit children as punishment. \nC has been assessed by a doctor and put on a different ADHD med since moving in which has made a small amount of improvement in his impulsivity, but he still get out of control very often.\nBoth dad and step mum have been very supportive towards E an I, and we are quite good friends. I am trying really hard to be understanding and supportive to C, but it\u0027s so hard when he is bullying my child. It\u0027s only been a month and I already have a big discontent towards him. (Not that I\u0027ve said that out loud or implied that to him or his family in any way) I feel like I can never leave C unsupervised, especially with E. I am always on high alert around him to try and protect my daughter. \n I am scared that I can\u0027t make this work and C is going to end up seriously hurting E, but I have literally no where else to live. Neither of my parents can take us in and I\u0027ve got no other family I can stay with. Im on a very low income of less than $350 a week and cannot afford any rental properties that are also near childcare centers and schools for E and I don\u0027t have a car. I do know I need to leave and get my daughter as far away from C as possible. But if I leave his parents have no one to care for him and get him ready for school in the morning, they will have to take time off work to look after him as it\u0027s illegal to leave him home alone, and he wouldn\u0027t get himself ready to go anyway. I want to leave but I would be screwing over my friends, and they don\u0027t deserve that. Part of me just wants to go \"not my circus, not my monkey\" and just leave anyway, but I feel so awful doing that. I care about this family and I want to help them, but I need to keep my daughter safe. What can I do to sort this out?",

Lol. \nFirst and foremost: the parents need to be doing this. The father NEEDS to back his wife up whether he’s seen what’s happened or not. My husband didn’t believe me about his son for years. Until he got full custody, actually. Nothing I do without my husbands backing when it comes to my stepson works. Even now. Nothing will work if he doesn’t trust her judgment and, if he doesn’t he shouldn’t leave her with the kid. Same goes for you too. And counseling for this kid ASAP. \nSome kids respond better to rewards as opposed to punishments. I switch it up between candy, healthy snacks they think are candy, small toys, special toys that were mine and they could only play with when they were being good for a long period of time and were put away otherwise (old GI Joe’s/legos/stuffed animals/puzzles), playing a quick game with them later (steal the pile is awesome for all ages), kids video games on my console, etc. \nAnd I always tried to explain to them why. Idk. I like to speak practically with my kids. “No, you cannot have any candy today because I know you didn’t brush your teeth last night.” Or “no, I’m not going to get the legos down because you thought it was okay to do (fill infraction here) and that’s against the rules if you want to play with my toys” (I’ve used this one on their toys too for serious infractions). In between that there’s your classic time outs and turning off the WiFi. \nI’ll also leave quiet/clean/productive things for them to do. Like, if there grounded from tv and video games I tell them they can still watch anything educational or they can still play with some toys. I still do this. If they get all of their chores done and don’t fight on the weekends they get a few options (depending on what we as parents have going on): video games/TV for a few hours/friend sleeping over/swimming. I do this all with my kids friends too when they’re with me. They sure don’t like cleaning their messes up but they’ll do it to be able to come over and play again. \nJust set down the list of rules and reward levels, when punishments are needed, and stick to it. It’s not easy, for sure, and it will take trial and error to see what works for each situation. Friday movie nights and game nights seem to do wonders too. But they need to see that the attention they get from good behavior is better than the attention from bad behavior. And all of the adults need to be on the same page and have patience and not expect it to happen overnight or without problems. ",

  "selftext": "This may be long so tl;dr- minor son was accused of molestation, and I\u0027m kinda ready to cut all ties.\n\nMy son is 12, the accuser (Leny) is 8. My son has never had any problems in the past. Leny has been touched before, watched people have sex before, or perform sexual acts, was taught to touch herself and insert things at a very young age (under 3). She has a lot of past issues that, imo, this stems from. \n\nThe accusation happened months ago, the time of the event/s was months prior to that. Cps was informed, they investigated, the police investigated. My son has denied it from day 1. Her \u0027story\u0027 changed multiple times. It later came out that she was mad that I basically have my son full-time, but still insists that it happened.  (Side note, she doesn\u0027t live with either parent, but still in the family. My son and her are family). \n\nToday was the first day they got together. My son was busy on his tablet, then talking on his phone, texting, etc. She kept getting mad that he wouldn\u0027t play with her and tried telling on him... another family member said it was bc he\u0027s hurt about what she said, and that he needs time.... She started off with, \"why is he hurt? I suffered through all that, I suffered through everything he made me do... whatever, you don\u0027t believe me anyways\".... which brought on the \"of course I believe you, but idk what happened bc I wasn\u0027t there, only you and him were\". \n\nI got a little mad, didn\u0027t say anything but still, mad. If you suffered through anything, then why do you want him to play with you? Leave him be. He\u0027s doing his own thing and honestly, it had nothing to do with that and everything to do with just wanting to talk with his friends. Hes 12, you\u0027re 8, if they weren\u0027t related, they wouldn\u0027t know about each other. \n\nLike I get it, they\u0027re family, but im ready to do all celebrations alone at this point and just never go there. Family is supposed to be there through thick and thin but honestly, why? It just doesn\u0027t seem with the hassle. And tbh, I\u0027m nervous of what she\u0027ll say now. \n\nSometime in the last month or two, she was getting \u0027disciplined\u0027 (really, just a talking to with a firm you need to act right before you get in trouble)... her response was, if you do anything, I\u0027ll call someone on you and you\u0027ll get in trouble. \n\nAs far as I know, she\u0027s now going to therapy but has only gone like 3 times. My son couldn\u0027t care less on what we do (whether we stay away or not) as long as he does get to see the other family members. And in my immature head, I have that nasty attitude tone like, \"you won\u0027t see him again, don\u0027t wanna make you SUFFER through anything\"\n\nIdk. I guess long story short, am I justified in feeling this way, just not going around her? Or how do I handle it bc ultimately they are family? ",

He breaks out in hives and has trouble breathing if he eats it. We carry an EpiPen and are very vocal when we eat out about letting restaurant staff know. We went to a local Chicago burger chain tonight (DMK burger). I ordered for my son kid burger no cheese he is allergic to dairy. The burger came out as a cheeseburger. Ok, this happens from time to time so I send it back and tell the kitchen staff directly myself he is ALLERGIC to dairy NO DAIRY. Next burger comes out and my son takes a bite and spits it out and starts itching his tongue (he is 20 months old and can\u0027t talk). I open the bun and it is buttered. WTF!?! Are you kidding me!?!?! I am so upset at this point (my son is ok we gave him Benadryl and none went down so no EpiPen needed). I go and tell them all about this and the staff just kinda looks at me blankly. I ask to speak to a manager and her excuse was I\u0027m sorry there are some new people. So new people have zero idea what to do when people have allergies. You want to make it right and try to give me free milkshake cards. I don\u0027t want anything from DMK every again except for you to properly train your staff on allergies. It is 2018!! \nSorry just needed to vent thank you for reading.",

No regrets at all, but we worked our ass off to raise them. \n\nIn today’s world odds are one of them would be a stereotypical millennial....but somehow I have raised three ambitious children all getting graduate degrees before 25. A teacher, an engineer and a lawyer. \n\nI struggle to see what I did right and wrong. I stressed education, was semi engaged with their teachers, my Ex worked at the school for part of it. I was angry when the kids screwed up....traffic tickets, partying, etc. \n\nI also only allowed a field of study which resulted in a job posting. I gave them that guidance. Disallowed psychology and advertising as college degrees. \n\nI feel the best thing I did was to raise them in Naperville, Il. You can google the suburb. The schools are fantastic, the neighborhoods excellent and the community is full of successful people. It was just an atmosphere that hard work was expected. College was expected, not really an option. This was not a recipe for success as many were not. \n\nAffluence brings drugs, dependency, and depression these days. \n\nA few things I said to my kids....”if you do not like me telling you what to do, then get a degree and a job”.....”most things in life you will learn what not to do”.  “That just closed a door” ( in reference to being caught drinking and kicked off sports team). \n\nEach of my children have had their implosions and learned from it.

  "title": "Navigating being the custodial parent with split summer visitation is tough. Making parenting decisions without input from bio dad is even tougher. Sometimes you just need some advice.",
  "selftext": "I\u0027m the mom of two growing, healthy boys. They are 9 and 11. Mind you, the youngest is on the spectrum (high functioning) and the eldest is full steam ahead into puberty, we are a pretty happy lot. \n\nI was married to their father for nearly 6 years before we divorced. Custody was mutually agreed upon with my having full physical custody, him having biweekly weekend visitation and 2 weeks of each summer month (June, July) and every other holiday. Your run of the mill farese visitation. My exhusband and I have our major differences- but for our kids sake, we have been extremely private about our disagreements, and acted to do what\u0027s best for our boys\u0027 welfare.\n\nRegardless of my opinion of the annoyances I have with him, and our extremely strained relationship, we were able to handle the kids business pretty well until around 3 months ago. I\u0027m hoping he is have a mid-life/existential crisis and will come around the person I know again. Being that our relationship has been deteriorating, I even admit that this may be due to the fact that I have grown intolerable of any nonsense or irresponsible behavior regarding anything to do with the kids. He doesn\u0027t endanger them, but is a man child if I\u0027m being kind. I\u0027ve been faced to make some major decisions alone.\n\nMy youngest had an extremely rough school year and I was faced with some surgeries from a trauma, tensions were high- but we navigated the best we could. We shed tears. The eldest had a rough time adjusting to a new school as well. He endured growing pains and hormonal surges. We fought hard to defeat our obstacles, and we succeeded in the end! A true victory for both the babes. School being conquered after a true close call was a blessing on the summer schedule. No summer school! \n\nThis left a perfect opportunity for me to delve into the internet for summer camps. The youngest wants to go to zoo camp, and Mr preteen wants to go to performing arts camp. They are registered for a VBS at their old school next week to start their summer back home from Dad\u0027s visitation in June. And for the last week in June, I\u0027ve registered them for the day camps of their interest. \n\nBoth boys are members of Boy Scouts. Their respective troops are not going to camp, but I\u0027ve failed to find a session that has individual registration (in MS, USA and surrounding areas) as of yet. (Any links would be appreciated) \n\nI really wanted them to experience an overnight camp. I started in May looking and found a few that could replace BSA camp. Most in this area are religious affiliates. I don\u0027t have a problem with this. The info I\u0027ve found seems the religious part is extremely benign and passive- I was more interested in the fun experiences offered like equine therapy, swimming, wilderness adventure, physical activity, arts and craft, survival skills, etc. \n\nYou see. Along with the testosterone and insane growth spurts this year, my oldest has gotten a bit chunky. He\u0027s been having some self esteem issues (he won\u0027t talk about it, but the clues are there and a mama knows) and I\u0027ve been trying to get him involved in his new school environment. He\u0027s also quit having interest in sports for a couple years and turned to being a tech junkie. I think camp would REALLY make a difference in his life and perspective for the positive. \n\nThe youngest. In lieu of BSA camp, I\u0027ve looked for Autism camps and applied for two- in May- as well as financial aid applications for each. It wasn\u0027t a requirement for his attendance but I am likely eligible due to some circumstances regarding my own disability after an accident and income guidelines. However- I planned on camp and am prepare to send these kids for an adventure of a lifetime! After all, I have amazing memories of Girl Scout Camp ! Matter of fact- I went at age 9 for my first time as well. I haven\u0027t received correspondence from those camps though. \n\nI am prepared to book overnight camp of SOME sort for July. I want to make sure before I do, that if I pick a session during the scheduled visitation with their father, that 1) he would be ok with this and even plan make up time with his boys 2) if no make up time, would he be responsible for making sure that they are taken to camp if I plan accordingly and pack etc.\n\nYou see- we haven\u0027t gotten along recently because he\u0027s failed to even get his kids for weekend visitation for months, refused to help financially for some medical expenses of the kids, and some other shady shit done to basically fraudulently gain income re: kids. So I KNOW I\u0027m 100% financially responsible for camp- I\u0027m ok with this- but I don\u0027t want to waste thousands of dollars for them not to attend. \n\n\nI\u0027m struggling today after trying to communicate a last ditch effort on the camp I should reserve for July and pay for with my ex. He won\u0027t respond. This has become typical behavior lately. Last year- I never would have believed it would be like this. I mean, he\u0027s an artist and by all means-  thinks like one. He said once, I quote, \"it takes nothing but love to raise a child\". Ask anyone who knew him, they\u0027d say he has a heart of gold. I guess the road to hell is truly paved with good intentions. He has always lacked in personal responsibility, motivation, and finance. But the negligent behavior and crass attitude and deception and manipulation has gotten out of hand. I\u0027ve held my ground and been the one to balance all it seems- alone. I have, however stood my ground meticulously, and become cold. I\u0027ve also refused to be an enabler of any sort. The last two weeks he had the kids (an act of God itself) I was vigilant on checking on the kids whereabouts and my ex\u0027s condition. I have (strong and verifiable) suspicion of some recreational (at minimal) drug use when he hasn\u0027t got the boys. Being in recovery (addiction and recovery post divorce for me) I\u0027m aware of every trick in the book and every tell tale sign. Being a Rn helps as well. I\u0027m certain they\u0027ve been safe the last 2 weeks. It it literally made for ZERO break for myself.  I just wish he would grow up, act right, communicate clearly and kindly with me in the best interest of our kids. I want his opinion on things that will mold and shape the men our children become. And it infuriates, saddens, yet strengthened me at times lately to know I\u0027m doing this on my own (for now hopefully, and not indefinitely). \n\nI want to know if I\u0027m making the right decisions. I want to share my concerns, my research into solutions for our children\u0027s wants and needs. Hell- I just want a co-parent. And I never thought I would want or have to want for that matter one. I honestly thought he would always be a good dad, and with age would mature and polish a bit. He\u0027s 40 now. I was wrong. \n\nReading different relationships and parenting subs helps me when I get to the point cracking. I post sometimes- looking for advice, or even just affirmation at times. I also have caught ten tons of hell from redditors for posting in times of high emotion when my words aren\u0027t eloquently written. But hasn\u0027t everyone who\u0027s posted here? 😂 \n\nAnyways- I just wanted to share something closely personal that I\u0027m struggling with currently. Why? Well if I analyzed it I could pin down my precise reasoning. But for now, dear reader, I\u0027ll explain myself saying I just want someone who can empathize, offer a suggestion based on my upcoming decision of July camp, offer a BSA camp (again we are in MS- Memphis TN council) suggestion, or words of encouragement. Hell- I\u0027ll even take correction of my behavior if you have some advice to offer that\u0027ll make like run more smoothly in my overflowing with love and chaos home. \n\nI may even take this post and run with it, boring you with my speed bumps I\u0027ve encountered and worries I have for the upcoming months and school year.

  "title": "Is having a second baby shower rude?",
  "selftext": "So I hope its okay to look for advice on this topic here cause we\u0027re struggling over the topic with other family.\n\nSo in 2017 we had our first child, and with that pregnancy came a baby shower before birth so we could get set up before baby got here. We got lots of helpful things and advice. We also got a lot of critism from older family members for doing a single, co-ed baby shower. It wasn\u0027t traditional cause guys were present, usually you have two parties for each side of the family, I planned and organized most of the event (which had to be done because both our moms are terrible planners and organizers)  and there were a lot of guests (a little over 100 because full families were invited cause we wanted family and friends with kids to be able to attend). \n\nIt was super stressful being told we were breaking every rule with our baby shower when all we thought we were doing was celebrating our new life with people who loved us through ours. And we really don\u0027t want to make that mistake again. So when we found out that we were pregnant again, we were pretty decided on being more careful this time to not offend our whole family. But turns out there are some family members that think its super rude to have a baby shower for any children that followed the first! Another cousin of mine recently had a baby shower for her second daughter and when I attended there were lots of whispers about how inappropriate it is and how she should have everything she needed from first kiddo - who is like 6 years old... I asummed because of the age gap, cousin probably gave away a lot of baby stuff since then - thus the need for a baby shower again. But apparently most people don\u0027t consider that and it made me double think us having a second baby shower, especially since our kids will be pretty close in age (little more than a year or 2 apart). I honestly just don\u0027t know what to do any more... We werent really planning to have another kid so close to our first, so as LO grew out of things, we got rid of them to help make space for his new growth. And then life happened, despite birth control... We still have some things, like the crib and changing table but thats only cause LO currently still uses them. I feel like a baby shower would be super helpful for helping us replace the things we mistakenly didn\u0027t think we\u0027d need but I really don\u0027t want to offend our family again. \n\nI guess, the TL;DR of this is, do you think its rude for families to have a baby shower for any child following the first born? If so, can you please explain why this is bad etiquette and what an appropriate form of celebration would be for new additions to family? What are your families personal experiences with baby showers and traditions around them?\n\nThanks in advance for your responses. I know this was a short novel to read.",

Please help\n\nSorry for the long post tldr: mother passed away recently, brother became argumentative and likes the fact that we don\u0027t talk anymore while living in the same house, this really hurt but I don\u0027t want to lose my little brother, what can I do?

  "selftext": "I am the one with the teen who has no interests, depression, and it has been a tough school year.\n\nMy daughter has been through a lot of therapy this year and decided she wants nothing to do with any school activities next year. She dropped out of her only activity which was chorus and is going to do nothing this summer by her own choice.\n\nI have tried to raise her with self confidence but she has decided this year it is all about what everyone else is doing at school. Everyone else had a boyfriend so she had to get one. She didn\u0027t even like this kid and broke up with him at the same time all the other girls ended up single.\n\nShe started cutting when another girl was sent to the ER for cutting at school. She thought it was awesome that the girl was the center of attention. I took her to get help immediately, but she admitted she only did it because she wanted to \"be cool\" and \"popular\".\n\nThis was a big one for me. We attended therapy and she swore she only did it for attention. I give her so much and felt like a failure as a parent. This was a slap in the face.\n\nWell, it is LGBT pride month and she came home from school with rainbows drawn all over herself in marker. She said some of the boys were making fun of her for being bi-sexual so she decided she is now bi because of the attention.\n\nShe isn\u0027t deciding she is bi because she has feelings for a certain girl, she is going to \"pretend to be bi\" to be more popular.\n\nThese are her words.\n\nSo, now she wants flannel because \"lesbians wear flannel\" and every other word out of her mouth is about how all the girls at school are trying to out-do each other by dressing in rainbow colors. She demanded I paint all her nails different rainbow colors, demands all new clothes, and I am really at my wits end.\n\nI explained I love her no matter what, but pretending to be someone you are not just so people like you is not only lying to yourself but also being disrespectful to the LGBT community.\n\nShe called me racist.\n\nI could really use some advice. School is almost out but I fear for her future. She will literally do anything that is \"cool\" and if there is drugs or alcohol involved, I know she will be right there first in line. Thanks.",

  "title": "My wife and I agreed before baby things would be a certain way - she is now the complete opposite and my worst nightmare: a 100% mombie. It is making me want to walk away. Help.",
  "selftext": "Wife and I are mid-30s, been together for 10 years, married for 7, have one child who just turned 3. \n\nMy wife was cool and fun - we traveled to over 30 countries together, enjoyed eating out with each other and going on dates and having fun and talking about politics and sports, we stayed fit together and we best friends who had a great adult relationship. \n\nBefore having kids, there were 2 big things we agreed on:\n\n1. That we were going to be \"one and done\" for primarily financial reasons. Kids are expensive, and sticking to one would also mean not having to sell our great apartment in a great location for more space. We\u0027d never be able to \"buy back in\" to what we have because prices/property values here have gone up about 40-50% since we bought 8 years ago and continue to increase. It is one of those suburbs very close to downtown that was really \"sketchy\" 15-25 years ago and went though a total revival. We bought in when it was reviving itself and not a lot of people realized it was going on so property prices were still low. Now everyone wants to live here. \n\n2.  We were never going to become like certain friends and relatives of ours - the ones we called the \"mombies and daddicts\". We were never \"childfree\" but those terms summed these people up perfectly - all they did was talk about parenting, seemed to be more like roommates that were given a baby to look after than a couple, where everything they did was \"child focused\" and they never did an adult thing for themselves, and went on horrible \"family vacations\" where everyone was miserable. We pledged not to take any \"shitty beach vacations\" with a little kid and save the money and have a better time when they were older.  We\u0027d still be adults and have adult lives while accommodating our child. \n\nMy wife has forgotten all of this and has become a full blown mombie and I am miserable. This is not the woman I married, this is not the woman I had kids with. She used to make fun of women like this more than anyone, and now she is their poster child. \n\nOur relationship has become miserable because she does\u0027t want to be a wife anymore, she ONLY wants to be a mom. Every time I tell her I want to go on a date and leave our child with our parents for the night, she tells me \"we are a family now, we don\u0027t just dump our child\" and she gets angry and defensive when I explain that taking some time to be a married couple while our kid is with her grandparents who dote on her does not mean we are \"dumping our child\". When I say our relationship as a couple is important, she says \"no, what matters is being mom and dad\". She refuses to go to marriage counseling because \"there is no problem, we both love our child\". \n\nI do love our child but it is getting that way that I am strongly considering divorcing my wife to have an actual adult relationship. \n\nOur sex life is shit because she is not interested in sex anymore, especially since I refuse to have a vasectomy reversal. She only wants to talk about the baby. She is not the interesting woman I married anymore. She complains endlessly about her weight but refuses to come and exercise (I constantly suggest going for a walk and she says no), she prepares crap food, and every time I cook and make something healthy, she picks at it and then pigs out on cookies. It is really annoying to hear the endless whinging when she is not willing to do something proactive to change it. I am not expecting her to look like a model, I just don\u0027t want to hear her whinging about being \"fat\" and then picking at the healthy homemade meal I made for dinner and going and eating a packet of cookies instead. We don\u0027t do ANYTHING as a couple anymore and isn\u0027t interested in doing anything to have an adult relationship anymore. \n\nMy wife is incapable of talking about anything that is not parenting or the baby and she has given up all her old friends and her only social circle is a fellow mombie group of friends she made that does nothing but hang out for play dates. If this is how she wants to spend her time, that\u0027s fine, but she keeps trying to force me to go and hang out with the other Dads. I don\u0027t enjoy their company from the couple of times we met and the only thing we have in common is that our wives became friends on Facebook. and would rather hang out with my \"real\" friends - the ones I have had for years and am friends with because I want to be their friend and because we have common interests, not because our wives are friends. \n\nShe always complains when I want to hang out with them to play video games or watch football or even go to the pub and have a couple of beers, even though I have always told her she is welcome to go and hang out with her friends without the child too, we just need to make sure schedules line up. But she never takes me up on it and she basically implies I am an asshole for thinking it is possible to have fun without our kid. Some of these friends have kids, some don\u0027t. \n\nShe refuses to go back to work even though her paid maternity leave is well and truly up. This is causing much greater financial stress than I planned for before having the baby (the plan was she would stay at home for a year), and I am constantly not doing things because of a  lack of money. I am getting resentful at supporting her while she won\u0027t work by choice. When I try to raise this with her, and tell her I would like her to work even just part time, she gets angry and defensive and says \"being a mom is the most important job\" and \"how dare you suggest I should not be spending my time with my child\". \n\nRight now she is angry because I don\u0027t want to go to Disney on Ice. We agreed we would never be the parents who would do this shit. I told her she can take her to Disney on Ice, but count me out. Now I\u0027m an uncaring asshole who hates family time. I don\u0027t hate \"family time\", I just hate shit like Paw Patrol concerts and Disney on Ice. And of course, whose wages are paying for these expensive concert tickets? There are plenty of other LESS EXPENSIVE ways we can do family time, but unless it is her way, it is wrong. \n\nShe gets annoyed when I want to watch a football game and put it on the tv and sit our kid next to me to watch because \"you should put on something more suitable for her\". What? What happened to not letting the child dictate everything? The kid gets plenty of time to watch Peppa Pig and Paw Patrol, football won\u0027t hurt her. It can actually be a bonding experience - some of my favourite memories as a kid are watching football with my dad, and not just because I am a guy, my sister had fun with it too. And if she decides she doesn\u0027t like watching football, well, she can get up and go play with her toys. It won\u0027t fucking kill her to not ALWAYS have the TV tuned to something she likes to watch, and might even teach her that sometimes, HEAVEN FORBID, she won\u0027t get her own way. (But in the end, she actually sat and watched most of the game until she fell asleep at about 70 minutes). This morning, safter breakfast, she went and sat on the couch and was like \"Papa, watch football again?\". So maybe, shocker, things turned out fine. But my wife is still saying I was selfish and not \"fully focused on my child\" even though SHE ACTUALLY ENJOYED IT. \n\nNow the icing on the cake is that she is hounding me to go on a \"family vacation\" to a country a 3 hour flight away. I would honestly fucking rather go to work. I liked traveling before my kid but still hated the whole airport/plane business (it was a necessary inconvenience to to endure to get to my destination), and the idea of doing it with a lively 3 year old who does *not* handle being tired well makes me shudder. It is going to be 33+ degrees every day at the time of year she wants to visit this place and our kid hates the head. Our kid will have their routine thrown out of whack which will make them tired and grumpy, they are not old enough to understand where they are and appreciate the destination we are spending well over €1000 to visit, and my \"holiday\" would consist of nothing but sitting by the kiddie pool of the hotel making sure the kid doesn\u0027t drown, and keeping sunscreen applied to her, and sitting at the beach bored out of my brain while she makes sandcastles and being made to pose for \"happy memory photos\" so my wife can post them on social media so all her mombie friends can comment even though I am not a big fan of having my picture taken and even less of a fan of it being posted online. \n\nShe is starting to say he wants a second child, and I told her that we were \"one and done\" and that has caused arguments and she is furious I won\u0027t look into a vasectomy reversal. I haven\u0027t changed my mind. Sorry not sorry. I love my daughter and don\u0027t regret having her, but I will want to be \"one and done\". I like that we are pretty much \"out of the trenches\" with the most difficult part of having kids - she sleeps through the night, she is toilet trained, she is almost outgrown the tantrums (except for when she is really overtired - which, well, another reason I don\u0027t want to take her on a big holiday because that is a recipe for disaster). My kid is finally starting to be fun more than she is difficult. \n\nI have 0 interest in going back to the beginning again and my wife is angry I won\u0027t consider it. She wants to move out of the city and have another child and is furious I won\u0027t consider the vasectomy reversal. \n\nBut the thing is - I don\u0027t think I\u0027d have had my daughter with her if I knew the kind of mother she was going to become. \n\nThere. I said it. \n\nI don\u0027t regret my daughter, but if I had a crystal ball and could see that this is what she was going to become? I wouldn\u0027t have done it with her. I don\u0027t regret my child, but I regret the woman I had the child with. \n\nI am scared that she will not take it well if I ask for a divorce and will try and withhold my child from me and that I will be the huge asshole. I hate that I feel this way, but while I love my child, I don\u0027t think I can stand this marriage anymore when she has no desire to change it. \n\nAnyone been in my position and can give some advice? \n",

    "comment_body": "I think you were both not well informed when you said little to nothing would change after having a baby because things will change (usually drastically) 100% of the time. I get that it annoys you that your wife is not the exact woman you married. While it sounds like she *could* be suffering from postpartum anxiety and/or depression (looking at a few of your complaints, and assuming they\u0027re not exaggerated), and even though she\u0027s being silly about counseling, you both need to see someone. That being said, I don\u0027t think you\u0027re ready to be a dad and I hope she will come to realize that so you two can come to a mutual separation. The child you created should be more important to you than anything else in the world. You should Want to spend time with them instead of going out with the boys most of the time (admittedly I didn\u0027t catch how often you go out, once or twice a month is reasonable as long as you realize many parents don\u0027t even get that privilege).  imo, you making fun of your definition of \"mombies\" is a clear indication that you don\u0027t know what parenting is about (also I wouldn\u0027t be proud of making fun of anyone behind their backs,  that\u0027s not something a mature person does?).  it\u0027s about your child. and you should be willing to sacrifice (at least a little if not everything) to make sure your child is being raised in a healthy,  safe, and loving environment. I\u0027m not saying your wife is justified in all of the complaints you made about her but honestly,  she is in most of them.  it sounds like her postpartum maternal instinct is teaching her more than you\u0027ll ever know about being a parent.

  "selftext": "hi all of r/parenting. i was here a few months ago asking for advice, got some good advice, so i\u0027m back looking for more.\n\nmy daughter is in grade 8 and just hit puberty in late February. since then i\u0027ve noticed some expected changes in her behaviour... it\u0027s been an adjustment period as i\u0027m having a hard time with her new found obsession with her appearance. \n\nLaura has been showing an interest in makeup and clothing that I feel are \"too mature\" for a 13 year old. i\u0027ve noticed this likely stems from the 14-16 year old instagram stars that she is constantly looking at, as well as the fact that she has made friends with some older girls in grade 10. i personally feel worried about her showing such an interest in her appearance at a young age due to my own history (i started my disordered eating patterns around 14).. So I have been strict in not buying her items she has been asking. This blew up in the biggest fight i\u0027ve ever had with her, as I had gotten her \"kids toys\" (which in my defense she still enjoyed) and not what she wanted for her birthday.\n\ni feel like my daughter is in a rush to grow up, and i feel it\u0027s from being pressured by social media/her friends to do so. an example of such is that at her birthday party, she went about hiding her barbies/stuffed animals and taking down her paintings of fairies before her friends arrived. i\u0027ll catch her still playing and sewing clothing for her stuffed animals, but then when listening to conversations with her friends she\u0027ll denounce such activities and call them \"childish\". \n\ni\u0027ve told her she doesn\u0027t need to change who she is to fit in, but that lead to another outburst where i was told that \"i didn\u0027t understand\". i need some advice on how to go about this, as i feel i\u0027ve been going about it all wrong.",

I really do appreciate everyone’s thoughts and advice.\n\nTo clarify a couple things, this wasnt our normal babysitter. It’s our plan B that we’ve used for over a month when our Plan A had surgery and here and there when she has appointments and such. This made it difficult because my  kid doesn’t know all of the children’s names. Also, I wasn’t sure which kid it was. Once my kid was in bed, I pulled up the babysitters Facebook and asked husband which kid she pointed out. It was the older one. \n\nWe called my daughters PCP the next morning who instructed us to go to the children’s hospital ASAP. I expressed concern over doing like a rape kit, and he explained that that isn’t really how it works and to let them handle. (Which many of you suggested)\n\nSide note: babysitter texted me the next morning asking if the girls were coming over that day. Kind of blew my mind that it was such a non issue to her, but I just didn’t respond. \n\nThe children’s hospital was absolutely incredible. They did do some testing and swabs but I can’t speak highly enough of how they handled it. For all my kid knew, she was there because she was sick two weeks ago, and had no idea she was there because of the incident. \n\nI was set up with deputy who facilitates these types of cases with CPS, and she has us set with a forensic interview on Monday. Based on that info, they’ll know how to proceed.\n\nMy kid is business as usual. We don’t talk about it around her at all. She has brought it up a couple times, to me, my mom, and her normal babysitter. We already gave them a heads up that if she talks about it, listen, but don’t ask questions. \n\nTo the people who think I’m over reacting, I just disagree. I feel strongly that it, at minimum needs to be documented. And my kid needs to be given the tools to deal with it, if she needs to. I don’t want to victimize her or make it a thing for her if it isn’t going to be, but if it is, I want her to be taken care of. \n\nCPS doesn’t storm their house or anything, and to that point, that family doesn’t even know. They’re waiting to gather all the info before proceeding. \n\nThat’s it for now. I’ll know more after Monday I guess of what’s going on. She’s currently pounding on the bathroom door demanding to go swimming. Business as usual. \n\n\n\n",

Financially, they take so much out of you that there’s nothing left for the two adults in the situation. No splurging, no vacations, no nothing. They take all your time and energy and every parent I’ve talked to who has been honest tells me that their kids are all they think about. I’ve always considered myself a bit of a philosopher and I’ve always thought about all things, big and small. It scares me to imagine a life where my brain power has to be focused into just one (or god forbid, multiple) thing(s). And with the way the world is looking to turn, I don’t know if this is a place I’d want to leave someone for the next 80 plus years.\n\nMy mom is already getting the hankering for a grandchild, and both me and my 22 yo sister are firmly on the childfree train with my 16 yo brother seeming on that same path. I’m at college now, halfway through my intended Master’s in computer science but I know once I get out and find a woman I love the questions and pressure will come pouring in. I can’t help but wonder if a vasectomy now will eliminate that threat as well as eliminate the fear of an accidental pregnancy caused by either a mistake by me or by the woman I’m having sex with. If I’m gonna be honest, I haven’t had sex in a good time because of the fear that the condom will break, or she gave me a poked condom, or even a freak accident.\n\nI want the ease of mind that even if something were to happen, my jimmy is shooting blank and that the threat isn’t there. I’ve always been more open to adoption than having one of my own, but I wouldn’t even consider it until I’ve exercised the wild bones out of my body and I’m in a great place both financially and emotionally. I don’t hate kids, and if I eventually become an uncle I’d be the best damn uncle in the entire world, but the constant strain and pressure just doesn’t sit well with me, it never has and more than likely never will.\n\nSorry for the long, rant-y post but it’s just sat heavy on me for these last few months especially. If you stuck around to read this I congratulate you on being able to sit through my ramblings.\n\n\nTL;DR: I want a vasectomy for many reasons, and I’d like to know your opinions on if I’m just being a dumb 20 yo or if this is something that will pass and I end up regretting my decision.",

  "title": "One year later, with Jacobsen Syndrome.",
  "selftext": "I made a post a year ago about how my wife was falling to pieces after our first child was diagnosed with a very rare genetic disorder, Jacobsen syndrome.  Daughter is 18 months old now, and my wife is still my wife.  Here\u0027s an update.\n\nJacobsen syndrome is most commonly caused by pure random chance, where a piece of chromosome 11q breaks off (i.e. a deletion).  Ours is such a case. The size of the deletion usually indicates how severe the symptoms experienced will be, but of course every case is completely different.  We have a moderately sized deletion... not small, not huge either.    \n\n\nThe range of symptoms is pretty wide, and you don\u0027t necessarily experience every symptom, but we\u0027ve definitely got the common ones so far: facial features, trigonocephaly, heart defect, severe feeding difficulties, immunodeficiency, bleeding/bruising problems, developmental delays, and more.  There is a common correlation between Jacobsen and autism spectrum disorders, ADHD, and the like.    \n\n\nWe had severe feeding difficulties from the very beginning.  Poor latching, very uncoordinated swallowing, some food aspiration, and a lot of vomiting.  We had to have a naso\\-gastric feeding tube initially because our daughter was a failure to thrive at 3 months.  At 12 months that was changed to a surgically\\-placed G\\-tube.  I wish now that we had done the G\\-tube sooner, or even from the very beginning, but it was our sincere hope that she would learn to eat by mouth, and we wanted to avoid surgery if possible.  Sadly, that was not the case.  The NG\\-tube is not intended for long\\-term use, and eventually got to a point where we were spending literally 16 hours a day running food into her through the NG\\-tube, not to mention the impact it was having on her speech development (she wasn\u0027t even babbling by 12 months, but who would want to talk with a rubber tube stuck up their nose and down their throat into their stomach?).  The surgery was scary, but went perfectly.  She started babbling within a month of getting the tube removed, and we\u0027re now only spending about 8 hours a day on her feeds.  We can run an overnight feed using a pump, now, too, since we don\u0027t have to worry about tube placement so much and thus don\u0027t have to worry about accidentally drowning her with food.    \n\n\nWeekly physical therapy for her has done great.  She\u0027s not \\*quite\\* walking yet but pretty damn close.  I\u0027m not concerned about her mobility at 18 months.  Speech therapy has not had much success...  she never did get a coordinated swallow, still doesn\u0027t get any significant calories by mouth (though she LOVES to taste things, and really wants to participate when we have meals...her favorite thing right now is licking all the ranch dressing or whatever off a celery stick, then handing me the chewed\\-on stick for more).  She started babbling a few consonant sounds at 13 months, but hasn\u0027t really progressed since then.  Still just babbling and shrieking.  I\u0027m not too concerned yet, but it is definitely something we are trying to improve on.  \n\n\nImmunodeficiency and bruising/bleeding problems remain an issue, though thankfully we haven\u0027t been hit TOO badly yet.  She does have a functioning immune system, just with a very low T\\-cell count.  Her immunologist actually recommended we hold off on some of her vaccinations, especially the live\\-virus ones, until she\u0027s a bit older, to try to give her body time to build up some more.  When she went in for the surgery to install the G\\-tube, she had to have a platelet transfusion beforehand.  She is so very mobile now with the crawling and trying\\-to\\-walk that her legs and forehead are constantly getting ugly purple bruises.  I keep telling people \"yeah, but you should see the OTHER baby\".  She hasn\u0027t slowed down one bit.  We\u0027ve had a few major illnesses (one round of the flu, an eye infection, and two mystery viruses with scary\\-high fevers), but nothing that required any hospitalization.  All in all, we\u0027ve done okay on the immune\\-system front.  \n\n\nCardiology continues to be happy with her growth, ever since putting her on a feeding tube.  The hole in her heart hasn\u0027t closed, but it has gotten smaller and continues to do so.  If it hasn\u0027t closed by age 3 or 4, they say they\u0027ll probably have to do surgery then to close it, but otherwise just keep monitoring every 3\\-6 months.    \n\n\nWork\\-wise, I\u0027ve burned just about all my vacation and sick time up from staying home with her on days when her grandparents can\u0027t help.  I\u0027m about to have to start taking some FMLA time unless we can get in\\-home professional help.  I\u0027m trying to navigate the medicaid/Katie Beckett paperwork to get that rolling, but it is NOT a quick process.  We cant put our daughter into a traditional daycare, due to the daily vomiting problems that continue.  \n\n\nMy wife is... in a better head\\-space than she was a year ago.  I\u0027m still not entirely convinced she has accepted our daughter for who she is, but at least she\u0027s coping better now, and not blowing up at me quite so often anymore.  She never was willing to go to a therapist on her own.  I tried taking her to a therapist with me, but it turned into an hour of her unloading about everything I was doing wrong, how little I was helping, and avoiding addressing any of her issues.  Not exactly productive, so after 2 of those sessions I stopped bothering.  She did some other things that helped, and we had some major fights that led to eventual communication progress, but we are still not in a great spot as far as our relationship.  We only get to sleep in the same bed about once or twice a week, and usually one of us has left for the guest bedroom before the night is through.  Sex...just doesn\u0027t happen anymore.   I\u0027m interested, she\u0027s not.  I\u0027m trying not to make an issue of it (yet), but something will have to change at some point.  At home, I still get my head bit off for not having read her mind about something at least once a week, sometimes a lot more often than that.  Sometimes she\u0027s actually sweet again.  And she does at least save her best energy for our daughter.     \n\n\nWe don\u0027t know what the future looks like for our daughter yet.  There\u0027s definitely some delay on things like speech and certain aspects of communication and cognition, but she\u0027s also demonstrated outstanding technical aptitude and cleverness, especially where mechanical things are involved.  She\u0027s very sociable with family members, even ones she hasn\u0027t met beforehand, but she does get overwhelmed pretty quickly in a crowd or group classroom setting.  She gets a little bit of contact with other kids, and shows interest in them to an extent, but also is pretty happy as a solo\\-explorer.  We\u0027re signed up on a waiting list to get her into an intensive feeding program for kids who are feeding tube dependent.  That program is out of the local autism center, so our hope is there will be other programs she\u0027ll qualify for and benefit from as well.  My hope is for her to one day be able to take care of herself.  Happy, healthy, and self\\-sufficient.  The rest is details.  It\u0027s not a given, though, so I\u0027m already altering my long\\-term plans to be prepared for possible scenarios where she is NOT able to take care of herself and will have to be provided for into her old age.    \n\n\nThere\u0027s a bi\\-annual conference for 11q disorders coming up later this month in San Diego.  I am hoping to be there, but otherwise I will be watching all of their recorded sessions on YouTube later.   I haven\u0027t found any sort of support group of other parents with 11q children yet.  It\u0027s rare enough that there just aren\u0027t that many families out there that we can relate with.  There are some other people I\u0027ve been able to talk to, though, mainly through the feeding tube stuff.  I bring my daughter to work a fair amount (because I don\u0027t have any other choice, really), and a few other parents have seen the feeding tube and equipment and come up to talk shop with me about it, since they had children on feeding tubes as well.\n\nThat\u0027s a lot of rambling, so I guess here\u0027s a tl;dr summary:\n\n\\*N\\-G tube: scary at first, had plenty of heart\\-rending moments with it, eventually outgrew it.\n\n\\*G tube: terrifying beforehand, still not thrilled about the surgical scarring she\u0027ll always have, but otherwise no biggie, and since we\u0027re stuck with a tube anyway, I wish we\u0027d done it a lot sooner.\n\n\\*chronic vomiting: sucks, because state law says any kid who throws up twice a day gets sent home from daycare, and that\u0027s a normal day for us.\n\n\\*medicaid/Katie Beckett: long, slow painful application process, but hopefully we\u0027ll be able to get some in\\-home help soon.\n\n\\*wife: still kind of being a self\\-absorbed bitch, but we\u0027re working on it, and she\u0027s being good to our daughter.\n\n\\*daughter: absolutely the sweetest little girl, and I will continue to do whatever is necessary to provide and care for her and try to give her the best possible future.  Early intervention therapies have already helped, and more will continue to help as she gets older.\n\n\\*me: I\u0027m okay.  Life, relationship, work, etc haven\u0027t come to a crashing halt.  None of them are in the shape I want them to be, but I\u0027m not giving up.\n\n\\*you: thanks for reading.    \n",

  "title": "Transitioning from homeschool to public school in junior high (7th grade)",
  "selftext": "I was a teacher before quitting to homeschool my kids. I homeschooled for a few reasons but the main one was because our schools are poorly funded, overly crowded, and have limited recess for little kids. I didn\u0027t want my kids in that kind of environment. Fortunately middle school offers school choice. My oldest is going into 7th and has begged to go to public school for the last few years. We are allowing him to this year. He took an exam for the school he wants to go to and got in with flying colors. \n\nMy kids aren\u0027t completely isolated from the world. He plays football for the community team and does little league baseball so he hangs out with other kids a lot. Some of the kids will go to the same school as him. I know that middle school can be rough though and want to set him up for the best chance to succeed. My son is a little more innocent and has struggled with his friends talking about drugs and sex and dating. We have talked a lot about this but he has expressed that he feels out of the loop or like a little kid around them when they talk about those things. I\u0027m not sure how to help him navigate that. \n\nHow much involvement do you have with their schooling?. I let my son make his schedule with his new guidance counselor and he seems pleased with it. I have 5 kids so we stay on a strict schedule with homeschooling. Do you make your child do homework at a certain time? He\u0027ll be doing football once school starts so I want to make sure he has time for everything. Do you help with homework or check it? \n\nI have also read that clothes are the most important thing to middle schoolers. My son doesn\u0027t care yet and wears basketball shorts year round with either a t-shirt or sweatshirt depending on the temperature. That seems common based on what I could tell but isn\u0027t exactly stylish. I know that sneakers are a big thing among his friends. Anything else I should be aware of as far as clothing is concerned? Are the small things (braclets, necklaces, socks, underwear, hats, etc.) important? My son wears a necklace and braclet often. Is that uncool? He wears Hanes and Fruit of the Loom for socks and underwear. Are those middle school approved brands? \n\nAnything else you think I should know about sending a kid to middle school after being homeschooled his whole life?\n",

  "title": "My 5 year old son thinks his Dad is coming back.",
  "selftext": "Two years ago I came on here to ask for some advice about my son who had just turned 4. The advice I got then was very helpful and I\u0027m hoping you can help again.\n\nBack story. My wife and I have two sons, one is 8 months old and is genetically both of ours. Our eldest was born before I met her and I am in the process of adopting. \n\nHis Genetic father is an alcoholic and has spent time in a psych ward before after a drunken episode which involved him assaulting a Doctor. He is estranged from his entire family after he spat in his own Mothers face. My wife stood by him for 5 years and when she ended up having unprotected sex one night the morning after pill did not work. So She decided to give motherhood a go.\n\nWhen he had just turned two his Dad ended up throwing a coffee cup at him and my partner and called his son a fucking lunatic to which she said enough was enough and broke contact with him (he was annoyed at being woken up early on father\u0027s day when he was trying to sleep off a hangover. His son started crying because they were stood outside the house for half an hour and he got bored). A few months later he would end up spitting in his mother\u0027s face when she found him in their garage drunk and he threatened to kill her to boot. He ended up being shipped off to another part of the country being told never to return. His parents (my son\u0027s grandparents) paid his rent and sent him food so he could drink all day. Why they do this I don\u0027t know but I suppose maybe they thought he was better off drinking in a corner somewhere.\n\nIn short this guy is a piece of work. The very worst. \n\nA year later I met his mother my wife on a dating site and things just clicked. We were stupidly happy. Bought a house together and blended seemlessly as a family. The kid in question is very loveable and by the time he was 4 he called me Dad and had no memory of anyone but me being Dad.\n\nMy wife came up with an idea. Perhaps we could just pretend his real Dad didn\u0027t exist till he was much older. Seemed fair enough but I came on here for advice first.\n\nThe result was unanimous. Tell him you\u0027re not his genetic Dad and do it yesterday. I had 100 comments telling me that if we kept it a secret the day he found out the truth he wouldn\u0027t trust us. If we let him know matter of factly and brought it up he would not understand at first. But gradually he would realise and he would feel like he\u0027d always known. So that\u0027s what we did and everything was fine.\n\nThen he started to ask where his other Dad was. So we said he was sick and had to go away and I was the replacement (not a lie. Alcoholism is a sickness some can\u0027t beat). Over the last few months he has been telling people his other Dad is going to come back. He will get better and come back. We have told him he won\u0027t get better. But he keeps deciding that he will get better and come back soon.\n\nHe is never coming back. He doesn\u0027t want to see his son again and things have got worse. He was evicted due to verbally abusing neighbours. He now is a homeless man living in an old van and sitting on the streets during the day. Genetic Dad\u0027s family are decent people and we see them a lot so they keep us filled in on his movements. He has two brothers and sisters who he doesn\u0027t really see as the last time he had contact with one of the brothers he drunkenly threatened his family and the police had to remove him. Having spoken to the family they are not sure he will live much longer or may be on his way to jail as there have been incidents with members of the public.\n\nReddit what do we tell our 5 year old son? How do we explain his Dad is a raging alcoholic who is never coming back? He can\u0027t be convinced he\u0027s not and I don\u0027t think he\u0027s ready for the brutal truth.",

  "title": "I killed my only child...(yet I wanna adopt)",
  "selftext": "There is no other way to title this post than that. I created this Reddit account just for this, but i just finally wanted to tell my story. (i can see this subreddit is up beat in nature, so i am sorry for the depressing story. \n\nTwo years ago, my son passed away at the age of 22 due to complications from his obesity and its all my fault. At 22 he weighed, frankly, close to 1,000 pounds and was immobile. Granted, I know there was trauma he suffered that was out of my control, I enabled him to gain all that weight. \n\nWhen he was a child, he was molested by my ex\\-husband. He had abused my baby from the age of 2\\-4 and I had no idea of it until it was far too late. Sure, my ex was arrested and we never had to see him again but the trauma and pain never went away. \n\nAs a rape victim myself, I knew exactly what my son was dealing with, so I was extra sensitive in helping him cope, and naturally i spoiled him. I was raped by a neighbor as a teen and my way of coping was with alcohol, for my son it was food and i knew it. I could tell how much food made him happy, so I gave him everything he wanted with no restriction. I allowed him to stuff his face as much as he desired because i knew it\u0027d make him happy. My son had always been obese but it wasnt until puberty that he REALLY began to pack on weight. By the time he started highschool, he was already 400 pounds and due to bullying he had to begin home school. I personally loved him being in home school because then he no longer had to deal with the strangers of the outside. He was safe with me. After that, he became very sedentary and gained about 100 pounds every year until his 22nd. \n\nIts been two years and i dont forgive myself for what i did to my baby. Part of me overfed him to fill him with love but another part did to make sure he\u0027d never leave my sight (as twisted as that is).\n\nIt\u0027s no secret i was mentally ill while my son was alive but over the past two years I\u0027v been sober, regularly attened therapy and have try to help my community (especially in issues dealing with childhood obesity). \n\nI know iv made mistakes (mistakes that I still cry myself to sleep to) but I do believe iv made an honest attempt to make up for what iv done and I want a 2nd chance at being a mother. \n\nIm 42 and i dont plan on getting pregnant again but is it so bad for me to want to adopt. I know that I have more than enough love to give to a precious child (especially for a potentially starving and impoverished child in need of a loving home). \n\nI know if i did this my son would be proud of me and thats enough to want to give it a try.\n\nI know the application process is a long shot anyway, but am i a horrible woman for wanting to adopt another child?",

  "title": "Teenager\u0027s preference for (possible addiction to?) Beastiality Porn",
  "selftext": "I\u0027m seeking advice on my step-son\u0027s apparent addiction to beastiality porn. My wife, her ex-husband, and I pride ourselves on our \"tri-parenting\" ability. We are at a loss on this one. Let me start at the beginning:\n\nWhen he was 12 or 13, we found out he discovered porn. My wife told him he could talk to either me, his dad, or her about it. He chose her (he\u0027s a momma\u0027s boy). She told him that porn isn\u0027t realistic. It\u0027s understandable to look at that stuff, but imagination is usually better. She talked about the dangers of computer viruses, etc. She emphasized that he should not build his expectations about sex based on porn. We also added parental controls to his phone and any devices he had access to.\n\nHe found a way around parental controls, of course. He\u0027s a smart teenager. We knew he would. I kept an eye on his activity from time to time.\n\nAbout a year ago, when he was probably 13, my wife caught him on his phone late at night when he was supposed to be asleep. She took the phone from him and told him to go to sleep. His face looked incredibly worried.\n\n\"Please don\u0027t, I\u0027m weird. I\u0027m so weird.\"\n\nWell, she looked at the phone screen to see hentai-type stuff that included, like, werewolves and squids and stuff. We looked through his history to see a mixture of more \"normal\" porn and the hentai-type porn with animals.\n\nWe talked to his dad, who agreed with me that it was more than likely just curiosity. We\u0027ve all been there. His mom disagreed. She was very concerned. (Side-note: she is not at all conservative about porn. When I met her she had a huge porn collection herself. It\u0027s not the porn that bothered her, it was the animal stuff.)\n\nAnyway, that night, she didn\u0027t really say anything other than he shouldn\u0027t be looking at that sort of thing and let him go to sleep.\n\nHe also used his phone to chat with his friends through discord. I\u0027m not too familiar with discord other than it\u0027s like a private forum for people to talk. Anyway, he and his friends frequently posted milder pictures of hentai porn and cartoon animal-type porn pictures.\n\nFast forward a few months, he ended up ruining his phone from porn viruses. Looking at his history, it was again a mixture of the more \"normal\" porn with the animal-focus stuff. However, there was more focus on the animal stuff. A mixture of stuff including World of Warcraft porn, cartoon porn, animal porn. We talked to his dad, and he seemed very dismissal. \"So the kid\u0027s got a fetish, so what?\"\n\nWell, his mom talked to my step-son again, emphasizing that beastiality porn is illegal.\n\nAgain, he was finding ways around any parental controls we used. Again, we knew he would. Still kept an eye on activity. Seemed to be still a mix of the more \"normal\" and beastiality-focused.\n\nHe\u0027s 14 now. He failed social studies despite being a literal genius and having the ability to easily pass. That\u0027s another story though. The point is, he lost access to most technology as a punishment, so I haven\u0027t had to keep a check on his internet usage. Today, I found his Nintendo 3DS, which he wasn\u0027t supposed to have, in his bed. The browser doesn\u0027t really hold internet history. It only holds temporary history. But my goodness. From what I can see, he has been on literally nothing but beastiality porn-- real pictures and videos with women sucking off horses and stuff, for hours and hours every night after bed time.\n\nWhat\u0027s the appeal? How do we address this without making it worse?  \n\n\ntl;dr--  \nMy step-son started with \"normal\" porn around age 12, found his way around parental controls and his interest in beastiality porn progress to what now at 14 seems to be an addiction. How do we address this?",

  "title": "My son doesn\u0027t clean up his cum",
  "selftext": "\n\nHello, I\u0027m a mom with a 17 year old son, and I have a couple questions. First of all, I just want to say that in my house, it is only my teenage son and I, (his father not living in the house, with me being divorced). Anyway, before I get to the question, I also want to point out that my son has masturbated for the past couple years, as all teenage boys do during this time, and I have known about it, and told him that I am completely fine with him masturbating whenever he feels like he needs to take care of himself. I\u0027m not a very strict parent when it comes to that sort of thing, I mean really, boys will be boys, and giving him that little bit of freedom to take care of his pent up sexual desires is much better than having him feel awkward, embarrassed ,or ashamed whenever he needs to do it. I even told him that I was fine with him watching porn, being how old he was and how it would also help him finish faster. Anyway, as the time passed, I noticed that he was spending more and more time in his bedroom and in the bathroom. The only thing that bothered me about this was that I wasn\u0027t spending the time that I would like to have with him, and I also don\u0027t like him to get up in the middle of a show or movie just to go masturbate, which he personally takes about 5-10 minutes to do, depending on how stimulated he is. So as of a couple months ago, I told my son that he could just masturbate while we were watching TV, or wherever he needed to, without having him absent for 10 minutes every time he leaves. I mean, I only have the weekends off, so it would be nice to spend the most time with him as possible, when is he is busy doing something else. When I told him this, he felt a little awkward about it at first, but then warmed up to the idea and accepted it. So, one day, while we\u0027re both watching a movie, he felt the urge to masturbate, which I was fine with, and wasn\u0027t uncomfortable with, being as how I\u0027ve seen his penis plenty of times being his mother groing up. As he finished stroking his penis, he ejaculated cum all over the couch, missing his belly, where he usually shoots it. He told me he was sorry, and I just nodded it off telling him that it was an old couch anyway. I really didn\u0027t think anything more of it than I would a spilled drink. So, more days passed, and he masturbated more and more on the couch, shooting his cum on the couch, this time on purpose, so he wouldn\u0027t have to clean himself off. My couch is brown, so all of his white semen stains were very visible. My couch now basically looks like it was previously owned by a porn company, with all the seats and arm rests being covered in big globs of his dried semen. There was one time I sat down in the couch, and felt something wet soak though my skirt. I touched my butt with my hand and saw his cum, still wet, and it was a big load too, staining my skirt, and making my panties drenched with the smell of his semen. So I washed my hand off and threw my skirt and panties into the laundry, and just skipped wiping my butt off, because it had already dried. Also, whenever I have my girlfriends over for a visit, they keep asking me what the white stains are.. One of my friends having gotten some on her butt too, and telling me she knew what it was, and that she is really confused why I wouldn\u0027t make my son clean up, or even make him do it in private. So a few days ago, as we both layed on the couch, snuggled close up to each other watching a movie, a sex scene came on, and he whipped out his penis and vigorously started jerking off. I turned to him and asked if he could possibly shoot it on his belly this time. He was confused and asked why, since the past few weeks I let him shoot it on the couch. I didn\u0027t exactly give him a straight answer, and he wasn\u0027t really paying attention when he finished, and I just watched him ejaculate a huge load all over my body. He said that he was really sorry and didn\u0027t mean to get it on me because he was distracted. He had shot his cum on my stomach, breasts, and a few drops even reached as far as my face, getting in my mouth. I was shocked, and got up to clean myself off. Letter I told him that I knew it was an accident, and that everything is all fine. But two questions... Should I make him wipe up his cum, or should I just make him do it in private all together? Please respond, I don\u0027t want to ruin, anything good we have, but don\u0027t like anymore accidents.\n\n\n",

  "selftext": "I\u0027ve already told her my position, and am ready to let it go, but I was wondering if reddit might have a better perspective on this topic (please let me know if there\u0027s a better community for this post). I am trying not to be judgmental but realistic. This post isn\u0027t so I can convince her, but maybe so I can just vent or be convinced that I\u0027m wrong.\n\nThere are two sides to the story, of course. Here\u0027s what I tried to convey:\n\nShe is in her mid 20s and only recently found some kind of stability in life. She has been with her boyfriend for 1 year, worked through a period where he was considering leaving just to experience the single life a few months ago. They are both definitely family-focused, caring types, but he also said he \u0027might\u0027 regret being a dad this young. She has depression and anxiety issues, even suicidal thoughts from months ago and has a hard time leaving bed some days. She has a part-time cashier job and no money saved up. She is living with her parents who would be upset if she has a baby. I feel these can make it very hard to be an effective parent right now, and she should focus on herself.\n\nHer side:\n\nShe is friends with a lot of moms who had unplanned pregnancies and things seem to have worked out. She has wanted a baby for several years, and has met the person she thinks would be a great parent, wants to be a parent and sometimes makes $40/hr in construction. When they occasionally have unprotected sex there is a low chance of pregnancy anyway. She has a big support system, including the other moms, and the boyfriend\u0027s family has helped a lot with babysitting etc (even to the point of paying for private school) with the babies and girlfriends of their sons, even when the couple has broken up. Having a baby will help motivate her to work harder and save money. Worst case scenario, there are good communities and resources in this area available for low-income single moms. She has gotten much stronger dealing with her mental issues over the years, and has hope and faith that things will always work out.\n\nI know I probably come off as very judgmental...honestly it feels like she\u0027s settling not only for her life but the baby\u0027s. I\u0027m interested in hearing from people who can see her side and know working class parents like her friends...thanks.",

Things like night lights, stuffed animals, etc. She has a bed time routine too, but, inevitably, she’ll wander into our room at some point in the night. \n\nI don’t have the heart to lock our door, because she genuinely might need something (although we do have to lock it during sex). \n\n*The other problem is that my husband is **zero** help.*\n\nMy daughter has learned that her dad won’t put her back into her own bed. Only mommy will. I actually caught her touching our heads in the dark when she thought I was sleeping. Apparently she was trying figure out what side of the bed I was on so she could choose the opposite side.\n\nI’ve discussed this with my husband. He has no excuse for not putting her back except that he “feels sorry for her”. He says he wants her to stay in her own room but also doesn’t think it’s a big deal and assumes she’ll grow out of it.\n\nI think he doesn’t want to deal with the tantrum/crying that will result when she’s kicked out of our room. \n\nSo this has all fallen on me.

  "title": "A Letter I wrote to my kids on Fathers Day",
  "selftext": "Dear kids,\n\nI want you to know some things. You’re too young to understand them now, so I wrote this as a reminder to me.\n\nWhen you were born I had to rethink my life. I was now responsible for you. It is my duty (and perhaps always will be) to guide you, protect you, and help you. You always come first, in all things. I sacrificed some exciting opportunities so I could provide you with a safe, loving home. I sacrificed my health to protect yours. Understand, though, that I made those sacrifices without reservation and with full consent. More importantly, though I made those sacrifices, you don’t owe me anything in return.\n\nThere are generations of parents who want their children to become doctors or lawyers or whatever career they view as glamorous, perhaps feeling they could live in that glory vicariously, even if it’s their children who has to do all of the excruciating work to get there. When I was first asked, “What do you want your kids to be when they grow up?” I realized then the answer is simply “happy.” I don’t care if you take up engineering, or waitressing, or medicine or fruit-picking. I’ll be proud of you, whatever you choose. What I care about is that each day you wake up feeling good about yourself, and that you have the time to appreciate the beautiful moments that life can offer. I care that you have peace in your heart and and a full understanding of how special you are to me. I care that your struggles will resolve and that you can find the strength to endure the painful times that life inevitably brings.\n\nIt is not my job to make your choices for you. My job is to guide you to the forks in the road, and let you choose which path to take. You will make mistakes as you progress through life. Most will be minor, but you\u0027ll probably make some big ones. No matter what happens, I will always be in your corner. You may have to deal with harsh consequences for some of your choices, but I will always be there before, during and after. \n\nIn my old age, I hope you will come see me. I will never call you and ask you why you don’t call more often. I will never complain when you visit that you don’t visit enough. I will always open the door with a big smile on my face, and probably tears in my eyes. I will hug you and tell you how happy I am to see you. And when it is time for you to depart, I will hug you again tell you how thankful I am to have you as my kids.\n\nDuring my childhood my loyalty was constantly questioned by my parents. They pressed me about how I had to show I loved them, and how I had an inviolable duty to take care of them. Placing them in a nursing home, no matter the circumstances, was tantamount to betrayal. I will not do this to you. If I am so infirm that I need to be placed in a nursing home, I will trust you as my loving children to help me make that decision. Come see me at the home when you can, and when you want to. I will be grateful. Know that I want you to live *your* lives. Don’t sacrifice your health for me. Don’t turn down opportunities because of me. Don’t give up your happiness because of me. From the moment you were born your life belonged to *you*. \n\nThere is no present you can buy me, no honour you can bestow on me, that will be more cherished than the time you want to spend with me. \n\nNow that I have written this, I have decided it should be given to you after I have gone. I hope I am strong enough to do everything I have promised. If I have not, please forgive me as you can. If I have, please remember that I was able to do these things because you inspired me so much to be the kind of dad you deserved. \n\nWith undying love,\n\nDad.",

  "selftext": "Soo many things have happened in my marraige. Let\u0027s just say that the last few years of my life have been tough.  I lived overseas with my husband. He worked for his father. I didn\u0027t have a good relationship with my father in law. I felt that he was controlling and my husband was never on my side. Once I had an operation because of a mastitis infection. I had a 3 year old and a 16 month old at home.  I was so hormonal and angry and wanted to go back to the US.  My husband held a meeting with his family and I and humiliated me in every way possible. He told everyone I wasn\u0027t a good wife and I wanted to leave him. His father told me that \"women will always be the losers in life.\"\n\nFast forward to a year later when things simmered down,  I was back in the US for a vacation.  (I had an tiny disagreement with my sis in law before i left and told her my father was too involved with my life).  My father in law sent me a rude message from overseas and said that i would have to follow his rules if I want to go back. He told me if I don\u0027t agree he would send me my things. I was so upset and knew the best thing would be to stay in the US. My husbands family had business here that he could help manage. My husband decided he wanted to move in with his mom. I begged him not to and told him we needed a year alone but he said if I don\u0027t want to live with his mom, the marriage is over.\n\nAnyway a year has passed of me living with my husband, daughters and mother in law.   ive been busy taking care of the girls, cooking for the family and doing all the laundry n chores myself. My husband, is busy running around doing stuff for his parents. His parents own several commercial and residential properties. I find it weird that they don\u0027t allow their older son to have his own house. Even if it\u0027s a studio apartment! He\u0027s been trying to start his own business but hasn\u0027t really done much.  He spends his nights up til 2am and falls asleep on the couch. His mom once told him not to stress out or work hard because he will have his inheritance one day. He has friends that have all offered him jobs but he doesn\u0027t want to work for anyone.  We didn\u0027t have insurance for 3 months and we finally got on Medicaid. I have a college degree but haven\u0027t worked in 8 years. Im studying so I can get some certifications and find a job by the fall. I\u0027m just so fed up right now. I honestly don\u0027t feel like i\u0027m in an marriage. I don\u0027t think he will care if he loses me. I\u0027m up every morning at 6am with my girls. I take care of myself. I try really hard to be positive but I\u0027m starting to get depressed and sad these days.  I feel like my husband only talks to me when he wants to have sex or talk about his business ideas. It\u0027s also annoying to hang out with him when his mom is around us. I don\u0027t feel like myself. Is this normal life? Am I being selfish? my mother in law use to live with my single 36 year old sis in law. As soon as she found out we moved back, she moved out. I feel so turned off now by my husband. I feel like he has no motivation and cares about his marriage. I want to find a job and eventually just move out with my children. Is it wrong of me to think this way?",

  "selftext": "Hey everyone, so I’m not an actual parent. However, I am a very concerned older sister, who practically raised my 13 year old sister. \n\nToday, while my sister was at volleyball practice, I was playing helix jump on her phone. I became curious of what was on her Snapchat, because apparently there’s a feature on there called “my eyes only”, that she’s always been very paranoid and hesitant to share with me. Now, look..l I should not have snooped, I was certainly in the wrong there. \n\nSo, as you can guess, I saw around ten explicit butt pictures, mirror pictures, that were all angled disturbingly explicit. \n\nAfter practice, while we were driving to lunch in the car, I made up a “news story” about how Snapchat had a security breach and everybody’s saved photos were now in a database and “police”were going to track down all under age users who had nudes (she’s 13 I figured she would buy it). To my luck she did, and she admitted it. I told her I knew, and I lied about the data breach (lol). \n\nShe became very clearly ashamed. I asked why she did it, and told me her bf at the time had asked her for them multiple times, and she finally sent them. Fucking little punk...\n\nAnyways, I told my mom and she confronted her about it. We had a talk, we’re on good terms, but I want to know what I can do to help her understand the potential  consequences of this. I told her she’s too young to have any sexual relationships, and she doesn’t need to prove her worth to anyone, and she’s still young that these actions could have some very bad outcomes. \n\nIs there anything else I can do? Where did I go wrong? I’m 21 btw so I am significantly older than she is. I am also worried because I know boys her age, they’re immature and egotistical and will show their friends to seem cool...

  "selftext": "I have 2 16y/os and a 14y/o daughter. \n\nI’m absolutely terrified of my 14 y/o daughter. \n\nShe’s manipulative, and uses physical violence, blackmail, threats, and is dangerous to be around. She has a particular hatred for my 16 y/o daughter, and is always attacking her insecurities. \n \nShe (14 y/o) blames her behavior on us, openly harms herself and threatens to blame the harm done to herself on us as abuse, and is destructive to property as well. \n\nWe have to record the threats she makes so we don’t worry about being blamed as abusers by police. We’ve had to call police numerous times, it only results in psychiatric emergency department visits. \n\nShe’s been committed involuntarily 2 times until the insurance ran out, and was uncooperative and at times destructive on unit both times. \n\nShe cannot be trusted with any thing that could be a weapon, technology, or even office supplies. She cut herself using a staple remover and would guilt trip us for it. \n\nHer episodes are daily, and at this point in my mind she’s a lost cause. Every time she’s violent, my husband locks himself in with her and me and the 16 y/os leave to go hiking.\n\nShe’s stolen $600 in cash from her sister, $400 dollars from me, and $170 from her brother. \n\nWe try to be fair, but we can’t anymore. We have to lock her down harder than our other children. We don’t believe in the authoritarian parenting method either. We believe in using simple spoken rules. \n\nIn general, all we ask for is mutual respect and everybody to put in their part. Only technology restriction we put in place is during family meals, chores are always simple things we all trade off. \n\nThe 14 y/o refuses to participate in that structure in any sort of way, and we can’t get through to her. The kind way doesn’t work, the angry way doesn’t work, the ignore the behavior doesn’t work. \n\nWe had to remove her door from her room and replace it with a curtain due to the amount of times she barricaded herself and made threats of suicide to gain something, and because of the obsessive amounts of absolutely vile graffiti she carved and marked into her door. Misanthropic, homicidal, suicidal, and overtly sexually violent quotes and images mostly. \n\nI don’t believe in comparing my children but as for my 16 y/os, my daughter is in the school districts gifted \u0026 talented program, at the school that has the performing arts program (Choral and acting). She maintained B’s in enriched and AP classes, and always had good reports from teachers. Has never had any major disciplinary issues besides minor disagreements with other students. \n\nMy son is in the same gifted \u0026 talented program, he takes elective classes with an emphasis on medicine and technology. He averages As and Bs in enriched and normal classes, and participates in theatre tech club. Also no discipline issues. \n\nMy 14 y/o daughter averaged Cs and Ds, was resistant to doing work, refused to participate, and has been expelled from one school and will be dropping out this August (freshman year).

From what I read online, scabies are very contagious, transmitted by contact and fairly difficult to get rid of. My husband and I have three boys ages four to one. They will receive two ‘treatments’ at home and one more once they land.  Our first contact with them will be ten days from today and they told us about the scabies two days ago. \n\nI have never had personal experience with scabies and am scared of it infecting my children. What questions should I ask my brother?  Is this bad enough that we should ask him not to visit? Do we need to do anything to keep ourselves from being infected?  I could go down the overly direct route of demanding every detail of their treatment plan but that would be a startling deviation from our normal relationship and I’m worried it would hurt feelings.

  "title": "Family drama/Secrets between parents? Am I overreacting?",
  "selftext": "Hi all, I\u0027m looking for an outside opinion and if I am overreacting to situation. I hope  I chose the right subreddit.  I have two cousins, sisters we\u0027ll call them Sher, and Mary who are sisters. Sher (who has just returned from being away from our country for 2 years) and I are closer in age and have sons that are both 9 (18 days apart, referred to as \u0027the boys\u0027) her and I are best friends, and as such our sons are also best friends.  Mary who is older has a daughter that is 8 (and a son who is 5) .  \n\nWe have a family cabin we spend time at, and over the long weekend in may the four kids spent all weekend together. On the last day the four got into an argument, I never did get the full true story but the theme being that the two older boys were trying to keep their drawings /comics from Mary\u0027s daughter and didn\u0027t want her to see. She was very upset by this and the whole thing blew up. In the end I shut down the play area they were at and everyone played outside for the rest of the day.\n\nThat was three weeks ago. Sher who has just retuned home from a two year hiatus has coffee with her sister Mary earlier this week and tells Mary that after we left the cabin that weekend A showed her where the boys were keeping their comics and Mary took them from the play area. Apparently there were a lot of swears and sexual innuendos in the drawings. The drawings were done by my son and Shera son seemed to just be the by sander, Sher told me this at our visit today and we discussed how to approach it.\n\nMy problem being is that Mary who is my family and supposed to be my friend kept this information from me for over three weeks. I\u0027m offended that she kept this all from me. Obviously my son is going through some changes that we need to discuss with him but she didn\u0027t feel the need to tell me about it. Sher told me that she didn\u0027t want to say anything about it becuase she didn\u0027t want her daughter to get in trouble for \u0027tattleing\u0027 on the boys. Does she really doubt my abilities as a parent that we would concentrate on her daughter instead of my own?? I\u0027m feeling very betrayed by her and I\u0027m not sure where to go from here. Just looking for an outside perspective on the whole issue.\n\nSide note the two boys overheard our conversation and came to apologize right away to us about the \u0027comics at the cabin\u0027 as we still haven\u0027t seen exactly what they are I had asked them what they were and my son mentioned all the swears but not anything about sex.  Obviously we need to start having some talks with our son about growing up..\n\nStill I\u0027m feeling that is as parents should be on the same team, what Mary did feels like she betrayed me, I feel I have a right to know what is going on with my son.. I feel that she is not concerned about what is best for by family and that she really doubts my ability as a parent..... Am I over reacting? ",

Example: in my mom\u0027s eyes, you\u0027re only getting a real workout if you go to the gym, twice a day or more, for 2-3 hours, or more. Recently, she\u0027s gone into how apple cider vinegar is the cure all for everything (from weight loss to depressive psychotic episodes). \n\n2) still with the blame, I spent his entire life eating crap, giving him crap. I\u0027m still learning how to cook different meal options (turns out, you can put pork chops in the crockpot too! Who knew!). \n\n3) I\u0027m beginning to understand the carb addiction... his feel good drug... carbs make you feel good, even if it\u0027s for a little while.... and well, with our lazy lifestyle, it just packs on the pounds. \n\n\n\nOk.... so we joined a gym. Awesomeness! It has a pool. Very cool! For a little bit, I had a male \"friend\" go to the gym with him to kinda teach him the ropes... I\u0027ve noticed with me, he\u0027s stubborn and more argumentative. But with a male, he\u0027s more willing. This is also the only real male interaction he has... no father, no father figure and the men in my family - eh, they like to complain about his weight, say he\u0027s fat, but won\u0027t do anything with him. Anyways, the male \"friend\" I had... well, he creeps me out. Just making adult sexual undertones towards me, trying to play with my hair... so we\u0027ve kinda cut that out. I\u0027m willing to deal with my anxiety towards the guy if you guys think it\u0027ll benefit my son. \n\nThe last few days at the gym, my son will do less than 15 minutes on the treadmill, go to the weights... then he kinda stops. If I go to the weights, I kinda keep an eye on him and he\u0027s usually at the leg press, just sitting there. (My main focus is the treadmill though, doing couch to 5k)\n\nI know weight loss is in the kitchen though.... and this is where it gets tricky. I don\u0027t want to really deny foods but just keep it in moderation... more chicken than mac and cheese. Eat all the veggies first. Things like that... which did help... for a while, he had lost 5-10 lbs. But the issue? His friend. To be specific, his rich friend. He used to come over a lot with a backpack full of sweets. Last time, it was 2 packages of cookies, 3 big bags of candy, a bag of blow pops, a few things of chocolate candy (like the big Hershey bars), and a pie. I told him no thanks, make sure he takes it home, don\u0027t take it to the bedroom... ftr, he did take it to the bedroom and there were many empty wrappers. But now, my son will go out to meet him, they eat stuff (once, he came home with taco bell food) then my son comes home. My son has NO money on him. When he earns money, he wants it on the Xbox gift card (he mows 3 houses and between the three, he gets $50 and that\u0027s turned into game stop for the card). The rich friend, I\u0027m not sure about his family history. According to him, he lives with his grandma, has 17 siblings from his dad, and is basically left alone all day every day with tons of money. I\u0027ve even seen him at the grocery store a few times by himself. \n\nOk... so very long story short, I\u0027m not sure how to really get through to my son to kinda limit the sweet intake and have a better workout at the gym. I received an email offering 2 complimentary personal trainer sessions (about $80 each)... I\u0027m thinking about asking if I could put that towards my son\u0027s account (and ask for a male trainer to give him that missing connection-- or see if my \"friend\" is able to go to the gym with him again). Thoughts? \n\nThis change is still new, only a month (actually 29 days lol)... my info is female, 29, 5\u00273\" @ 246 (originally, I was 257/258)... my son is 12, 5\u00275\" @ 207 I believe (I haven\u0027t asked him to weigh himself since he gained the weight back. But he does have a doctor\u0027s appt this Friday, not a physical but to check his kidneys - he has PKD).",

I mostly ignore it but outright disrespect (name calling, certain words being used) can\u0027t get ignored. He has an attitude about everything and hasn\u0027t even started puberty yet. I know it\u0027ll get worse before it gets better but when does it get better? He can be such a sweet boy but then you ask him to take out the trash and he\u0027s having an epic meltdown. He\u0027s back to being sweet after that but I can\u0027t keep doing this with him. ",
