        "content": "My partner and my Mum have had a huge falling out over her tickling my daughter (age 4). \nMy daughter often likes to get completely naked and she was laying on the sofa and my mum (aged 70) was doing these slow massage tickles all over her body (except down below). It was over her lower tummy, inner thighs and bum cheeks then over her arms and back and neck etc. She\u2019s always done it since my daughter was a baby but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve seen her do it near to those zones before. Apparently she did it with me as a baby too. I did find it quite strange and awkward but didn\u2019t want to mention it as I thought it must be my issue for feeling weird, and I knew it wasn\u2019t a sexual thing (extremely disturbing thought), but when my partner (daughters dad) saw it he completely freaked out. When I told my mum he was uncomfortable, she stormed out of the room and had accused us of being sick and needing therapy. We now aren\u2019t speaking and I just feel completely devastated and confused about the whole situation \nIf it had been one of my daughters Grandads doing this my reaction would\u2019ve been a lot different but then maybe that means maybe it is weird. My partners mum is a health visitor and she said if she\u2019d witnessed that she would\u2019ve felt it was odd behaviour\u2026. My mum does have mental health problems and can be quite overbearing and stubborn about how things should be done (for example, she told me if I\u2019d chosen not to breastfeed we\u2019d have fallen out!!). What are everyone\u2019s thoughts?",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "1) its time to start talking to your child about when its appropriate to be naked. Times when you have company are not appropriate, IMO. \n\n2) I dont think your mom is a creep but this is not, again IM, appropriate if only because it blurs the lines of appropriate body touching.",

        "content": "So my 16 year old daughter was recently diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I'm not at all surprised, tbh. I have pretty severe anxiety (treated with medication) and started seeing some of the signs in her last year.  She finally felt ready to get help, and we took her to see a psychiatrist with an appointment next week with a therapist. It sucks she is dealing with this, but I'm happy she's getting help.\n\nMy question is about the medication, specifically the side effects with a teenage girl. While I had anxiety my whole life, I didn't start treatment until my late 20's due to being poor and not having health insurance. I know what my adult male side effects, and that some of them were rather embarrassing to discuss, so I'm wondering how any of you handled this with your teens. I know that the side effects of SSRI's, and especially the sexual side effects, are the most common reason kids stop taking them.\n\nBasically, I want to make sure this whole thing is making her life better, not worse. I guess I'm really just looking for other people's experience to make sure this all ends up positive for her.  Thanks!",

        "title": "At a loss.",
        "content": "I am a single mother of an adopted daughter who is 18 years old and graduated high school last May.  My daughter is always has been the joy of my life, but the last eight years have not been easy. When she was 10, she was diagnosed with very severe OCD, ADHD, depression, anxiety, and is borderline bipolar. She has been under the care of a psychiatrist for the last five years and has been in therapy with several different therapist over the last eight years. When she turned 13, she became incredibly boy obsessed, and our lives became very difficult because of this. She was sneaking boys into the house while I was sleeping at night for sex, she was lying about going to her friends and was actually meeting up with boys, she has been through one relationship after another, and all of them have involved being sexually active.I have her on birth control but she is very reckless and has had unprotected sex with multiple partners and has been very honest with me about this. She would always do fairly well in school, but the moment she started texting someone on Snapchat or Instagram and they showed interest in her physically she became obsessed and her grades would drop. It was a constant battle just to get her at a point where she could graduate. I actually had to put alarms on our doors and windows to let me know if she was leaving at night or sneaking someone in, because she was incredibly reckless about meeting boys online, taking them at their word for who they were, and inviting them to my home for sex. This scared the hell out of me and there were several times I had to get law enforcement involved because these men were not who they told her they were.  \n\nShe has had multiple issues with UTIs and illnesses, and I\u2019ve had to be in and out of the hospital with her at least every six weeks because she doesn\u2019t take care of herself.  \nWhen she doesn\u2019t take her meds, I can almost immediately see her becoming obsessed with Snapchat and I know that she has someone that she is trying to meet up with. Since the summer started, she\u2019s been refusing to go to therapy saying she doesn\u2019t need it.\n\nI was an older mother when I adopted  my daughter, and I get the things are different now than they were when I was her age, but this total recklessness with her health and her life and her sexuality has taken a toll on me, just from the stress and worry about her. The doctor bills from her psychiatrist and therapist, the hospital bills that I have had to pay out, the medication\u2019s I have had to pay for, have generally bankrupted me and that is also very stressful. I am not in good health, and my doctor has told me that if I don\u2019t start taking care of myself, I may not be around to see her graduate college.\n\nShe started college and is in a very intensive difficult program that is all online.  She was involved with someone over the summer who turned out to be a complete stalker, and it\u2019s been a lot of difficulty getting through that. I requested of her to leave the boys alone for two months until she got these intensive college classes.  She was doing great. She was studying hanging out with her what girlfriends she has. She\u2019s burned so many bridges because of her obsessions that she doesn\u2019t have many friends.\n\nAnd then on Tuesday, she decided to go out on a double date set up with one of her friends.  Apparently, the guy she met. Must\u2019ve really hit it off with her because she not only had sex with him on the first date, two days later she informed me she was going to go study with a friend and she spent five hours at his apartment and completely lied to me about it. When she came home, I was so angry with the constant lies and sneaking around that we had words.  During our argument, she begins telling me that I am oppressive, that I don\u2019t allow her to have a life, and I don\u2019t allow her to date, and she is now 18 and can do whatever the hell she wants. She then tells me she\u2019s leaving, And she did leave her car in the garage (a car that I am paying for) this boy came and picked her up and she told me she was moving in with him.  She has known him less than 48 hours.\n\nI let her go, because she\u2019s right I can\u2019t stop her. She is of age.  I am at a loss of what to do. I love my daughter, and while she has a very developed body, she also has the mentality, emotions, and social skills of someone who is more 15 or 16.  She is not ready, or capable to be on her own. I am paying all of the bills for her, and she doesn\u2019t work. This was an arrangement I made with her because I want to see her get her degree so she can be able to afford to live Better than just trying to survive on minimum wage.  \n\nI do not know what to do.  She texted me this morning and wants to come home. But then she told me that this guy wants her to stay the weekend, and that she\u2019s too embarrassed to come home so she\u2019s just going to stay with him for a little longer. I know why he wants her to stay.\n\nI\u2019m not comfortable allowing her to use my home as her revolving door with one relationship after another, and thinking that she can leave whenever she wants and stay as long as she wants with some guy for as long as he is using her.  I am at a loss. I\u2019m due to have surgery in a month, and I\u2019m going to have several months of recovery, and I don\u2019t think I can live with her constantly running in and out and never knowing when she\u2019s going to be home and when she\u2019s going to be staying with the latest person that she\u2019s with. But I\u2019m afraid if I give her an ultimatum, I will lose her for good.\n\nIf you read this whole thing, I thank you.  I never thought I\u2019d be asking for advice from the Internet, but then I never thought my daughter would reach this point. I honestly don\u2019t know what to do.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Hi. I read it. I feel the pain and love in your words.  \n\nShe's absolutely reckless right now. I didn't read any mention of a father figure in her life. That's probably what she's compensating for. \n\nKids rebel. Then they come back around after a few years, usually. They have to find their place in the world, and it's absolutely devastating to a mom who loves them. Trust me. Mine disappeared at 18 for 2 solid years. As hard as it was, I let her go. And, eventually, she came back. She came back cause she wanted something, and I wanted to tell her how she'd hurt me, but I kept my mouth shut and decided to start to build a relationship with my now grown-up daughter. I love her more than anything, and I'm proud of how she's done on her own. \n\nDon't get me wrong, she failed out of nursing school, she married a guy who was very wrong and he's already cheated on her and she took him back.. etc. She's made a lot of mistakes, but I validate her each and every time I see her. I tell her how great she looks, and she looks surprised someone would compliment her. I told her to try nursing school again, that she's smart enough, and that I believe in her. She did. She's doing well. \n\nYou can't stop her from going, but if she doesn't have you to rely on, then who will she run to? Make rules, set boundaries for what goes on under your roof, but don't forget that you are her safe place. Don't dwell on what she's doing wrong - and she's doing a lot wrong - but focus on the things she does right and praise the hell out of her for it. Notice little things and compliment her. She may always have a problem with men, she may seek counseling someday, she may find a good man and be happily married. She may be happily single. Nobody knows the future. Proceed with love as much as you can. She will listen to your advice more as she gets older and as you prove to her that you've got her back no matter what. \n\nThis is all my opinion, I'm no expert. I wish you and your daughter well.",

        "content": "We think it's time for our 8 year old son to learn about the \"birds and the bees\".\nHowever, we think his younger brother would also be ready for the talk and we are considering sitting down and learning about it as a family.\n\nFor context the 8yo is quite innocent and naive despite being a mature kid. He still believes in Santa Claus wholeheartedly and sleeps with his teddy every night. The 6yo figured out Santa wasn't real last Xmas and set his baby teddy aside years ago. He is really savvy and curious and is already much more aware of his body than his older brother.\n\nWe're counting on that the 6yo will happily ask the questions his big brother might feel too embarrassed to ask.\n\nWe're also hoping that by telling them together, they'll be able to have kid appropriate conversations later between themselves. Hopefully this will help mitigate the risk that they'll share what they've learned with another child as they will have each other to talk to.\n\nMost of the current literature states that children should actually learn about sexual health/reproduction earlier than previous generations had been told. Around age five is now the recommended age so we're actually a bit late with our eldest!\n\nI won't lie and say I'm looking forward to this conversation, so it's a bonus that we'll only have to rip the bandaid off once. My thoughts are that we can later check in with them individually at intervals in case they have questions that they want to talk about one on one.\n\nHas anyone else done this?

(Mother lied, called cps, stalked me and my family, made multiple threats against me, my husband (her ex), and our children) \n\nWe attempted mediations,and court intervention but once mom saw the court was not quick to put an end to her behavior it got 10xs worse and she started refusing visits, not showing up for custody exchanges, moved with no notice and we had to hire a lawyer to find her her residence (TWICE), removed her from school and \u201chomeschooled\u201d her bc she didn\u2019t want the schools to allow my husband information or involvement in school for their daughter. \n\nAfter years of it, and nothing changing and multiple court dates, multiple threats, and changes that the court would reprimand her for but make no changes, and multiple times calling police for visitation refusal, wellness checks and our children suffering, we moved out of state and lost all communication.\n\nRecently I found my stepdaughter\u2019s social media and was slapped in the face that the reality we were trying to stop, was happening. We had hoped that she wouldn\u2019t get into drugs, sex, and extreme behaviors if we had a hand in her upbringing and tried to be involved\u2026but she has shown to be very close to her mother with a very skewed view and memory of everything. \n\nAs I looked through her X account, I saw that she lists her age as 18 (she is 16), she also make VERY extreme sexual posts, and has posted about being high, or drunk or her pipe regularly. I cannot be positive mom knows but mom was an avid drug user until the birth of her last 2 kids so it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if mom knew and was \u201cok\u201d with it\u2026she is very developed and posts much of her chest (no nudity) on social media, and it truly makes me sad and worried for her mental health, her future and her safety. \n\nThere will always be someone who will take mom\u2019s side because the evil stepmom narrative, and I have stayed out of the \u201cway\u201d of mom as much as possible especially bc she made it a point to try to have my kids taken away, made false reports, called my jobs, ect. Bc she wanted me gone. Even telling my husband she hoped our \u201cstupid ass baby\u201d is born retarded, or still born. She\u2019s not the type to coparent or communicate\u2026it\u2019s her way or you can parish in a fire of her making.\n\nIdk what to do, if anything\u2026I guess I still remember the sweet little girl I met at 4 years old, who would ask me to lay in bed at night and talk about our favorite things, and would cry when she had fun on our visits together, and was scared of her mother and begged me to ask her mother to spend more time doing things together like we did\u2026she was 12 the last time we saw her and she has changed dramatically. \n\nI guess it\u2019s not my place, She has a mother and stepfather\u2026we have been cut off and slandered for years so even if we reached out we would be met with verbal assault and harassment from mom and her flying monkeys. \n\nI just wish the court had listened to my husband\u2019s concerns, our concerns\u2026.I feel sad the thing we tried to fight against is exactly how it turned out. \n\nMy husband and I have a daughter (12) and he is stepdad to my son (17) and they are so different from their sister bc of their relationship with us, I guess I am just sad to see her following her mother\u2019s lead and being so extreme at her age.",

He is adopted and has a severe history of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. He operates at more of a 2-3 year old emotional level due to his past trauma. \n\nI love him more than anything but sometimes I feel like I am losing my mind. His behaviors can be extremely exhausting and challenging. He is extremely defiant, destructive when angry, does not listen to almost anything, and is an emotional rollercoaster. He is aggressive towards peers at school (however this has gotten a lot better) and defiant there as well and has a 1:1 associate throughout his day. I know this is extremely vague, but also gives the broad scope of things. \n\nEvery day lately has been a struggle. I want nothing more for him to feel safe, loved, and happy, however I know he has a long ways to go due to his past in order to feel that. Today was an extremely hard day\u2026 he has been nonstop screaming at me, saying really hurtful things, and being outright defiant. He was put in a short 2-minute timeout for screaming at his dad for no reason. He then escalated and screamed at me and started self harming (punching himself, biting his entire hand, and scratching himself). He also started to scratch up the chair to which I asked him to please not do that and he refused to stop. I then tried grabbing his hands and moving them to his lap so he would stop and he then scratched me, twisted my arm, and squeezed my arm hard. In an extremely overwhelming and angry state, I said \u201cDon\u2019t you hurt me you motherfucker\u201d. And now I am ashamed that I let myself get to this point and worried about what I have done to him. \n\nDoes anyone have any guidance on how to move forward?",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "This may be a little bias because I am a therapist BUT therapy sounds like it would be beneficial. This can help build a support system outside of the home. There he can express himself and also act out his frustrations in a safe space (not hurting others). He can also develop coping mechanisms that work for him. Early intervention can be super helpful rather than waiting it out in the hopes things might get better. \n\nIt sounds like his frustrations are embodied, maybe looking into drama therapy. \n\nAside from that I\u2019m also adopted. I don\u2019t carry the trauma you discussed but identity is a super touchy topic. Along with the trauma, maybe he\u2019s beginning to struggle with who he is in the world?

We have a 6yo & 3yo\n\nIn the beginning I stayed home and took care of Eid everything, I had to teach him how to do everything as an adult man, and had to teach him how to be a parent, mind you I was knew to this too. \n\nAt that time that was what a lot of our fights were about. \n\nFast forward to like 2ish years ago. I started focusing on my own mental health after a really bad battle with PPD & PostpartumOCD \n\nI lost 125lb, and started taking care of myself and spending some alone time at the gym, which is something I\u2019ve never done before. \n\nI solely was a follower my entire life just desperately needing to be loved by anyone who would be looking at me, and honestly is why we even got together in the first place. \n\nOf course I liked him, and loved him when we met, but I had daddy/mommy issues for sure and couldn\u2019t be alone and cause us to start our relationship too soon.\n\nAnyways, through that journey I started my own business as a personal trainer, and photographer. \n\nHe has supported me financially through this time, but also has his own problems with money, and will just say yes to everything and not update me about finances until it\u2019s too late. Being we\u2019re both self employed this is extremely problematic.\n\nWhen I try to take over any time I bring up money even in the most lighthearted way, it started a fight. \n\nEvery time I have been in a vulnerable situation he will do everything to make it worse, postpartum, surgeries, breastfeeding, trying to work 3 jobs. He will pick fights with me, if I am upset from life he will make it about  him and suddenly now we\u2019re fighting. \n\nHe takes everything EXTREMELY personally, this is why we can\u2019t talk about money because he feels like I\u2019m telling him he\u2019s a failure.\n\nThis seeps into EVERYTHING, Our lack of sex life and my personal needs from a partner not being met ect. \n\nFast forward to now, I\u2019m working from home, at the gym, and doing photography trying to start my own business because he cannot invest in his own so someone needs to do it. Because it\u2019s not enough. \n\nI haven\u2019t worked this whole time because his schedule is unreasonable, so I had to find something I could do to make my own hour, and I love it. \n\nBut now all I\u2019m hearing it the kids needs aren\u2019t getting met, his needs are getting met. Blah blah blah. \n\nI told him I needed to grind really hard this summer, so I could afford daycare come fall, and then I can work during the day and be mom at night. He\u2019s been doing a lot of keeping up with the house and kids the last year which I haven\u2019t expressed my gratitude exponentially.\n\nBut yet it\u2019s a problem.\n\nI can\u2019t win. \n\nThis makes me so resentful, I feel I cannot rest, which makes me not attracted to him or feel sexual towards him at all, I get stressed with the kids, I get stressed with my job, I get stressed financially.\n\nIt\u2019s a never ending cycle. When I wasn\u2019t working it was somehow the same thing. \n\nHe is unable to initiate real life conversations, and gets mad when I do. Something as simple as making a basic decision for our kids and asking his feedback or telling him how I feel ends is dispute. \n\nPlus every single morning he\u2019s just rude and mad for nothing and I\u2019m sick of that disrespect tbh.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t even go into all the fights and how bad he is with all that. Not that I\u2019m perfect but his behavior is far worse.\n\nI feel like I can\u2019t talk about anything going on with me or even things I like without it being a fight. \n\nI\u2019m just so torn down, I just want to be alone and experience life without the need of worrying about a relationship. I was always so co dependent.\n\nFinancially leaving will be a huge struggle the state is very problematic to deal with and isn\u2019t offering much.\n\nIdeally I would like for us to ease into the separation, and co parent ect. But like I said anytime we have to talk or make a decision ITS HUGE FIGHTS. \n\nI feel like he will try to ruin my life any way he can or just make it harder than it has to be, because he already does this anytime I have added responsibilities.\n\nI often find myself dreaming of life alone or with a partner that isn\u2019t so involved or rushed.\n\nI told him this openly before, and it caused a lot of problems but I had immense guilt. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to address it again without everything ending abruptly including my businesses and kids life as we know it. \n\nI wish would could just keep our life but move on romantically \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI don\u2019t want to uproot my kids life, I love our neighborhood, I want to help his business grow so he is successful for our kids. Hes a good dad, but a bad partner and I just don\u2019t want it anymore. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just looking for general advice, or encouragement.\n\nThanks if you made it this far.",

        "content": "So my partner and I have been at odds, a lot, over the kids. For context my partner came into this relationship with a daughter (now) 16 (who we\u2019ve been told needs to be assessed for npd and bpd). I came into the relationship with a son (now) 13 that has ASD and adhd (along with a plethora of comorbidoties) and a daughter (now) 9 with severe ADHD. We recently had two children together a boy 2 and a girl 3. \n\nEarly on (2019) my partners daughter came to live with us full time after her mom passed. Not very long after we brought SD into our home we were dealing with her physically and emotionally bullying my son, lying, stealing, manipulation, hyper sexual behaviours, writing things like graphic gay porn novels and sharing them with younger kids, unsafe behaviours online which was happening because she was stealing devices in the middle of the night to use them, etc. At the time I was absolutely losing myself bc I had been telling him from day one he needed to enrol SD in counselling as she didn\u2019t just lose her mum, she lost her to an overdose and the home she was living in with her mum was very, very unstable (pimps, escorts, drug use and dealing drugs, etc). My spouse was reluctant to believe any of it was happening and I\u2019d often have to literally prove it by showing him graphic messages etc before he\u2019d finally concede that it was happening. After a while he finally agreed to getting her medical attention but it was usually myself taking her into the hospital etc. The doctors gave us very specific instructions as to how to deal with what was going on however my partner kept trying his own things and the behaviours have continued all until now. \n\nAs of late my BD has been showing a fair amount of rebellion. She has always been TOO honest but on some fronts that has begun to change. I\u2019ve had a few chats with the doc and she believes my daughter should be assessed for ODD but because it isn\u2019t severe she has told me to try certain strategies first before a referral or medication. To the point now, my BD has been lying about completing her chores. She goes long stretches without doing them at all and recently when asked why she said \u201cI don\u2019t know. I know I\u2019m supposed to do them but I really don\u2019t want to\u2026 and then I don\u2019t\u201d It\u2019s to the point she\u2019s resolved herself to the idea that each day when she comes home she shouldn\u2019t expect to do anything leisurely and instead opts for trying to sneakily (for example) watch tv even if it\u2019s something for the toddlers. \n\nNow, my partner has said to me that I need to be consequential with BD and it should be equivalent to the consequences SD has had in the past (bc at this point, despite repeated behaviours he no longer really gives consequences). I asked him why he thinks the circumstances are the same and should be handled the same and he said bc the long and short is rules being broken and to him it is irrelevant how egregious the broken rule or behaviour is. When I told him I can draw similarities but I cannot connect them as the same he said that I\u2019m choosing to be close minded and my thoughts are laced with favouritism. It\u2019s to the point that my spouse thinks BD should be made to miss out of her dance and cheerleading summer camp bc \u201cshe didn\u2019t learn from being grounded and told to isolate for a week so she needs something to learn to follow the rules\u201d.  \n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of issues between my spouse and I (for some time now), and my health isn\u2019t what it used to be. I\u2019m 34 being told by emerge doctors I have 5 years at best to live if I keep with the same life and issues that are causing me things like fibromyalgia, hypertension, etc. Not to mention I am diagnosed ADHD and my doc also thinks I likely have ASD. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m crazy and being too rigid thinking that these two circumstances are not the same\u2026 even still, I went and told BD she can\u2019t attend camp bc of the chores issues and right now I can feel my heart exploding in my chest. Am I really being ignorant and combative?",

        "content": "While I know this might seem like \"yet another pornography post\", I think I have a very specific concern and question. But before I get there, I'll share some background, research I've done, and talks we've already had (and by the way, this post will be somewhat NSFW).\n\nMy son is 13 and by no surprise, he's exploring his sexuality and learning about all the things that come with that. At a very early age, his mom and I have talked to him about what to expect with his body (puberty) and his anatomy. \n\nI noticed lately that he's started bypassing my network filters to look at porn. Again, not surprised, there's always a way around this stuff. I've also started slowly taking away some of that stuff to give him more independence. I don't really want to know if he masturbates, nor do I really want to be a snoopy helicopter parent.\n\nBut there are times where I am browsing family photos on his phone only to come across some porn or even hentai (anime porn). Quite a lot of it, actually, it seems like he's frequenting these sites as often as every day.\n\nWhen I find these photos, I don't get mad. It prompted me to have a few more conversations with him, some of these are repeat conversations from when he was 10-12:\n\n- I talk to him about consent. I want him to understand that no means NO.\n- I remind him that pornography does not represent real sexual relationships. And that they are actors, paid to perform unrealistic acts.\n- I also state that I do not want him looking up porn because the internet has some VERY messed up stuff, and the internet is \"all or nothing\". I don't want him having unfettered access to porn, for his own mental health and protection.\n- And most importantly, and I repeat this nearly every other breath: I tell him that how he feels and his sexuality is absolutely normal. It's normal for kids his age to be interested in this stuff.\n\nI do remind him that he's not in trouble or anything. And that all I want is for us to be able to trust each other. I feel like my talks with him have been pretty good, and follow most of the advice I've received in what I've read and in a few podcasts I listen to.\n\nSo here we get to the specific struggle I'm having. Is it OK for my kid to look at porn? Or put another way, since he'll probably do it anyway: How do I feel OK about him doing it? How do I make it safe?\n\nBack in my day, we had magazines, and it was all pretty \"safe\". My son doesn't have that sort of \"safety net\". He's finding all sorts of rule34 sites and who knows what else.\n\nI just can't resolve myself to tell him it's OK to look up porn on the internet (for a lot of the reasons I mentioned). But at the same time, I've flat out told him to stop looking it up, but I know he'll do it anyway -- so I feel like all I'm doing is putting him in a situation where he can't come talk to me, or has to hide more things from me.\n\nThere's a part of this that's probably a \"me issue\", and another part that will help me set better boundaries for him. I just don't know how to handle this; the idea of him looking at porn just makes me very uncomfortable.\n\nIf it helps add context: \n\n- He's on the spectrum (ASD; not severe) and has ADHD. He's very high functioning and I feel like this will potentially be more detrimental to his health since he's also struggling with some other mental issues right now; I just don't think porn is going to take him in a good direction.\n- I'm an atheist and he is too; thought I'd throw it out there if it impacts the advice/approach.",

        "content": "My daughter (we\u2019ll call her \u2018J\u2019 is 11) has a friend (call her \u2018A\u2019 also 11) that she met at her new school this past year. I\u2019ve always been really protective of my daughter because I want her to have a life I never did. A first came over right after Christmas. She lives in a really rough neighborhood, but I know not to judge her based on this. I thought she was a little different, but what kid isn\u2019t at that age?  As time went on, J kept talking about her and her home situation. She mentioned that she lives with her uncle and brother (18), because the mom is no good. A little odd, but okay. They\u2019re both a little on the rough side. No teeth, sores everywhere, etc.   She\u2019s mentioned her doing tattoos, like stick and pokes ( I have nothing against tattoos, I have plenty of them) at 11?! I let it roll off and talked to my daughter to never let someone do that to her because it\u2019s nearly forever. \nThere have been other things that concern me, like her constantly smelling like smoke. I know it\u2019s likely just her home situation, but I knew girls in 6th grade who smoked, and I wouldn\u2019t want J to be a part of that. \nI feel like A\u2019s family doesn\u2019t care what she is doing either. I\u2019ve listened to her on tik tok, and really vulgar things being said. I addressed it with her and told her, not at my house. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s still exposing J to it here, but just on the DL. I think she is trying to \u2018experiment\u2019 sexually with J. She\u2019s always very close and touching her in really strange ways. I don\u2019t like touching at all, so I always tell them to back off, but I think she tried to kiss J too. \nA is over today and everyone went swimming. Then I noticed her legs. She has self harm scars new and old all over her legs. Again, I have my own mental health issues and have dealt with the same, but in my adult life. Not at 11. It worries me that she\u2019s encouraging J to do this. I noticed some scratches all over her legs a couple days ago. I ask her what happened and she told me it was from the kitten we have.  Which, it very well could be, but I\u2019m not convinced. \nI have no way of contacting the uncle or mother about this. They\u2019ve never been home when I\u2019ve dropped A off or picked her up. I\u2019ve only seen them once at her birthday party. I\u2019m really concerned for both A and J. I know J loves her so much, but something just doesn\u2019t feel right. I think A deserves a better home life and stability, but I know this isn\u2019t something I can change, and I want to protect my daughter. What do I do?  Am I being too overprotective? Overthinking?

In addition to this, you should inform the school principal and school counselors for this upcoming school year, as they have access to further resources to get this child the help that she needs. \nI hope this is obvious but never let your child spend time at A\u2019s house. It\u2019s your house while under full supervision or nothing at all. You can also request through the school that your child\u2019s schedule is completely different from A\u2019s if you\u2019d like to pursue that option. \nA is clearly in need of stability and a safe space but it\u2019s okay if you can\u2019t be that space and it\u2019s also okay to not want A to influence your daughter negatively.",

        "content": "**TL;DR: My coparent has been accusing me various forms of abuse and neglect since we separated 4 years ago and isn't stopping. I don't have the money for a lawyer currently and am struggling with how this is affecting me, my friendships, and relationships. Seeking advice on how to \"let it go\" when she won't stop and I want to appear as cooperative as possible.**  \n  \nI'm looking for advice for coping with the emotions and fears that arise when my coparent makes baseless accusations of abuse and neglect to gain full custody.\n\nWe were together for 10 years and have been separated for almost 4 years at this point. Since then she has repeatedly made claims that I am neglectful, physically abusive, sexually abusive, and not fulfilling responsibilities when it comes to school and doctors appointments. Despite having no evidence of this, having a Guardian Ad Litem dismiss her claims, and having Child Protective Services dismiss her claims (multiple times), she is still attacking me and anyone I allow to get close to me. She has caused my friends to become unhoused, made legal threats against my coworkers and professional colleagues, and has harassed my family members.   \n  \nI don't like to label people as a \"narcissist\" or diagnosis others with mental illnesses as that is usually emotional and sensationalized, but any time I actually engage with her claims her responses usually follow DARVO form, making it difficult to actually discuss her concerns. The only substantial conversation we've had about all of this quickly spiraled and ended with her romanticizing the relationship that made us both miserable and ended with her threatening to un-alive herself if I didn't allow her to cheat.  \n  \nAll of this leaves me very emotionally distraught. She will claim that our kid complain about miserable with me and being scared of the people in my life, but he is only 4 years old and when I ask him about these claims he tells me a very different story. Some of these stories involve things that I know to be false - like the claim that me and 3 of my coworkers were molesting our child at my work. Other claims address things that could be true, but it's difficult for me to tell which of her accusations are based in reality and which are either emotionally inflated or flat out lies. For example, she has most recently begun accusing my significant other of 2 years of physical/emotional abuse, listing a new example after every custody exchange. I don't want to dismiss such serious concerns, but there have only been a handful of times something like this could have happened in a way that I didn't witness and both my child and S/O have independently denied my coparent's claims to me.\n\nThis leaves me in a very difficult spot. I'm torn between who I should trust, I end up second guessing myself, I am constantly defending myself to friends and family when venting about my struggles, I'm constantly judging my own parenting abilities, all while working multiple jobs just to pay my bills. At this point I usually grey-rock her, but she just won't stop. This is causing my S/O to rethink our relationship and her involvement in my life, and as emotionally difficult as that is I don't blame her for hesitating before getting further involved in this situation. \n\nI don't have the money for a lawyer, I've been trying to get our kid into therapy but all of the child therapists in my area are fully booked and difficult to get ahold of. I'm always on the grind trying to improve my financial situation so I can better protect myself and my kid, but how do I cope with these feelings in the meantime? I work 6-7 days a week and still make time to have meaningful moments with my kid, find a few days a month to socialize, have been dealing with my own physical health issues, I'm exhausted and its very difficult for me to just \"let it go\" when she's taken these claims to CPS before, causing me to lose custody while they investigated. Is this just a plateau of shittiness in my life?\n\nIf you think I'm in the wrong somewhere please tell me. I won't pretend to be a perfect person or a perfect parent but I don't think I'm doing anything egregious (and to my point, my coparent's feedback on that front isn't very reliable). Anyway, thank you for listening to me vent and thank you in advance for whatever responses you have.",

Some days it's agonizing, and there seems to be no end, other than once the kids are all 18...\n\nI was, earlier in our relationship, pretty candid with my wife that the only thing that ever had me doubting whether or not we'd last was her ex... However, I stuck it out, and I'm glad that I did because we have a wonderful marriage now.\n\nBut, not to be a stick in the mud, but... It doesn't really get better, per se. They never stop being shitty. They never give up the game. The only thing that you can do is take care of yourself, protect yourself, and find ways to cope. Grey rock, boundaries and info diet for everyone involved who listens to her BS, and parallel parenting with her. I'd get yourself into therapy, too, because it's draining and demoralizing and it sounds like it's taken a hit to your mental health.\n\nOne thing that might be helpful, though... Have you considered doing safe exchanges at a police station, if your city offers them? It's a service many do offer, where the parents park on opposite ends of the lot, and an officer escorts the child/ren to the other parent. We did this for years when the kids were little, to avoid the crazy that she would pull during drop-offs. We refused to speak or see her, outside of 1000% necessary information (drs visits, etc.) and would simply ignore anything else. Didn't stop her from pulling insane stunts, but we stuck to those boundaries and it at least offered protection for our lives and relationship.",

        "title": "Overbearing parenting or keep trying to enforce it?",
        "content": "I\u2019ll be honest this has been real tough, but in short my question is are we just destroying our relationship trying to enforce any sort of rules at this point?\n\nSo hopefully a quick background:\nOur 16 year old adopted daughter (nearly 17) is really struggling with substance abuse, dangerous life choices, and school. As soon as she started high school right after COVID she got in with a bad crowd. Started with vaping and quickly moved onto weed. Her biological mother had major mental health issues and substance abuse issues before we adopted her out of foster care when she was 7 years old. A couple issues we are seeing:\n\nAt this point she is addicted to nicotine and weed, although she will not admit that she has as problem. For the last three years we have continued to find vapes, cut up cords, and weed products. We have talked to her doctor with her and got a prescription to nicotine gum to try and help and find some avenue for her to quit. A month ago she had a medical emergency at work that the doctors say was directly related to high potency to vaping nicotine and weed and now are likely going to have life long complications and risks as well as life long medications to control this new condition.\n\nHer grades in high school were never good, but she has hit the point now of having failed so many class that she will likely have to do summer school and at least another semester to try and catch up credits. We believe she has the cognitive ability to do well in school, but she has not been prioritizing school and instead skips classes, ignores assignments, and just really blows off school. She has some pretty good aspirations and really is interested, but she doesn\u2019t see how not passing school will not allow her to achieve her goals.\n\nVery recently she created an online dating profile while at school on a school computer, claiming she was 19. Needless to say, many many men came out of the wood works to connect with her, by the time we found out (within a week or so), she had already snuck out in the middle of the night to meet a 19 year old man. Make no mistake, this man found out before meeting her that she is 16 and provided her with at least weed. He had been completely manipulating and coercing her into fully believing we are overbearing parents. Her doctor put her on birth control a couple of years ago to help calm her normal cycle, but she claims she ha no interest in sexual contact but that means almost nothing considering her and this man\u2019s intention.\n\nBecause of this relationship we have had to basically take away her phone and with school over she has no computer. At the moment she is on trip with her mother with no way to contact this individual. We did file a police report and the police have read through some their messages, but nothing was concrete at the time so they really just tried to talk to the individual. She also is in therapy and these topics have come up on her safety and what she considers safe choices, she maintains she knows what\u2019s safe and what\u2019s not safe.\n\nLastly from a background, she has several diagnosis including depression and two years ago she was cutting herself which we had to have her committed for psych evaluation, thankfully this has really not been an issue anymore.\n\nOnto my question and seeking advice, our daughter is a master of blaming us or anyone else for anything and claims we are too overbearing and controlling by not wanting her to smoke or vape (we recognize we can\u2019t really control that with is prevalence in school), not wanting her to have any relationship with this guy, and to focus on school. We feel we have been beat down and are feeling very defeated. We (individually or together) have had many, many hours long conversations where we get a very good insight into her choices she is making and she basically believes she is mature enough to make these choices and they won\u2019t impact her life goals, but the medical one alone will change her path to some degree. \nBut with her failing school, addiction causing ongoing medical issues, and these safety concerns over sneaking out with men, we are completely lost.\n\nAre we being too overbearing in having these arguments over and over again and trying to help her make better choices? We are aware at some point this will degrade into her simply moving out and our fear is putting her in even in more of an unsafe environment. Advice? Thoughts?",

Also, maybe going the route of harm reduction in regards to the marijuana, rather than complete abstinence, would help you in your endeavors to getting her to see the bigger picture, as it would challenge her ideas that you\u2019re being overbearing, and more so that you\u2019re coming from a place of care. \n\nLet\u2019s face it, teenagers are full of piss and vinegar, and because you\u2019re not able to be around her 24/7, she\u2019s going to find a way to do the things she isn\u2019t supposed to do, and right now you\u2019re fighting a losing battle.

That story is a post in itself but the relevant TLDR version of the how's and why's is I have severe depression with all the complimentary factors of depression and I was deemed unsafe for my kids to live with me. \n\nThat being said, I have been in therapy consistently for 4 years and have healed so much of my trauma and I continue to work on myself. \n\nMy ex (35M) and his wife (32f) pulled my kids out of school in 2017 to do home schooling with them.

She is very introverted, spends the majority of her time at Dad's house in her room on her tablet and drawing. \n\nAbout a year ago, she discovered the world of LGBTQIA+ and I could tell she found her home. She immediately identified as bisexual when she learned the definition. Over the year since that discovery the identity has shifted and she (I use she lightly here) has let me know that she feels more genderfliud or possibly trans. \n\nAs their Mom I have had several conversations where I encourage them to keep and open mind and not to get tied up in labels too much as those will shift several times sighting that I once identified as bisexuality and currently identify as a-sexual because I just don't have the energy. (Just tried to add a little jest) \n\nLet's call my 14 year old \"R\" for now so there are less opportunities for me to misgender or use the wrong pronouns moving forward.\n\nI also tell \"R\" that if they come to me tomorrow and tell me their name is Bob I will call them Bob and that the only thing I won't do is encourage gender affirming care until \"R\" is at least legal drinking age. \n\nThe trouble comes in with the ex and his wife. They are constantly telling \"R\" that they are doing this for attention. That they are flat out wrong. My Ex has gotten into 2 hour long arguments (reported by both children to me), taken friends away from \"R\" and outright told them that \"if you're born with pole you're male if you're born with a pole you're female\" His words not mine. \n\nClearly Dad is very conservative I'm the heart of the Bible belt.\n\n\"R\" has shared with me some self destructive and self harm tendencies that are fed by not being understood or accepted.  \n\nI am meeting with my Ex to share that part because I have to keep \"R's\" health top priority.

After refusing to seek help for her step children or even discover if the abuse had been perpetuated on her 4 children, I decided the only action I could take was to call CPS. My name was revealed by a caseworker to my in-laws and threats to my safety were made. With the unchecked sexual abuse happening, my husband and I had already decided our children could no longer have contact with their cousins for their own safety. Under the advise of a therapist, we explained the situation to each of our children, two teenagers and a pre-teen, in ways that were age appropriate and asked if anything inappropriate had happened to them. Thankfully nothing had happened to any of them or in their presence.\n\nMy father-in-law called me a bitch and my mother-in-law told me I was ruining her family. We broke off contact with father-in-law but my husband kept contact with his mom, with the understanding that our children never be around their cousins. After about 6 months and with pleading from my husband, I made some amends with my mother-in-law to the point where we agree for disagree and never talk about my SIL or her family.\n\nEaster is coming up and is a difficult holiday for my MIL because she found out my FIL was having an affair on Easter morning 11 years ago. They ended up divorcing after 30 years of marriage and the facade of a perfect life came crashing down. For the last 11 years we have always made sure to make this holiday everything MIL wants it to be, including refusing to take vacations during this time to be with her. The plan for this year had been to attend church with her and then head to her house for dinner afterwards. \n\nMIL just called my husband and let him know that she will be spending Sunday with SIL\u2019s family because SIL made plans for Saturday and cannot celebrate with her another day. She offered to spend time with us on Saturday instead. I\u2019m now 3 days from a holiday with no plans and no ability to make a special dinner as we are in the middle of a kitchen remodel. I have happily hosted in the past but don\u2019t have the ability to this year and on top of that, have no other family to celebrate with.\n\nI feel so lonely and hate that trying to live a better life than how either of us were raised has left my own children without extended family. I feel embarrassed about sharing with others why we don\u2019t have family around. I hate that I can\u2019t fully express to my children that in trying to protect them, I have pushed away people they love. Sometimes I wonder if I would be happier if I never spoke up or never did anything. But I look at how much my own abuse has affected me and I know how much I wish someone would have protected me. But will anyone ever think of it that way? Will I always be the villain to everyone in my life because I want something better for my own kids?",

        "title": "My son (9M) outed my stepson",
        "content": "EDIT: Idk if i can plst here so, sorry if it's not the good sub\n\nMy SS has been problematic since the start of him living with us, not that he's mean but he's dealing with a lot of problems wich make it difficult for everyone in our household. Recently, he's been making a LOT of efforts, not for me but especially for my kids (Sarah 8F and Peter 9M). He started teaching them boxing, watching movies with them, and he's paying more attention to Sarah's health (she is diabetic). They are not \"best friends\", they still argue a lot, and we can tell he feels awkward about showing affection, but it's getting better day by day. \n\nRecently my SS started invinting a guy from his sport club (let's call him G), something he has never done before, mainly because he has trouble making friends, and apparently they know each other since a long time (2-3 years), he even wanted to go on vacation with him. Obviously we were all happy for him, especially since G seems like a good friend.\n\nMy DH and i suspected that they were more than just friends, but there is no problem with it obviously and my DH was just waiting for SS to be ready to tell him.\n\nProblem: Peter saw G and SS kissing each other one day without them knowing. Two weeks ago my side of the family cam over for three days, and when we were all eating, Peter said in front of everyone that SS is gay and loves G. SS got angry and screamed at Peter to shut up and that he was lying. \nThe rest of those three days was awkward and SS didn't come to see my family after that.\n\nSS is extremely embarassed and angry, he has a lot of internalized homophobia and is saying he's not gay (but not denying his relationship with G). The reality is that his mom is homophobic so he doesn't want her to know it, he is craving her approvement from her. \nHe doesn't speak to Peter and Sarah anymore, doesn't spend time with them in the living room after school like he used to and doesn't teach them boxing anymore.\nThe ambiance in the house is back to shitty, Peter feels really guilty and cried because of the consequences of his mistake.\nI don't know what to do other than just wait honestly.\n\nEDIT: We did have a talk with both Peter and SS. Peter feels extremely guilty and wants to apologize to SS when he can. \n\nSS know we will accept him no matter his sexuality.\nI may be wrong but i think he isn't scared of us but more of himself, he is pretty homophobic and that's why we were surprised to discover he's gay, also it's important to note that he has been sexually abused by a man when he was a child so he's scared to not be seen as a \"real man\" (that fact that G is a really masculine guy doesn't help).\nHe doesn't have any contact with his mother anymore but she raised him in a homophobic environnement so it's hard for him to deconstruct.\n\nEDIT(2): My SS is 15, i forgot to add his age in the title",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "what kind of conversation did you have with Peter about this? did you shut it down in the moment? did you have a follow up conversation about how that sort of thing is private and up to others to share, not for us to call out? i see he feels guilty, but it's also important he learns never to do something like that again. it can be dangerous. \n\nhave you been able to talk to SS at all and validate that it wasn't okay for Peter to say those things? I'd say something like \"Look, that was really shitty what Peter did. He's still young and doesn't understand the implications of accusations like that. We've had a talk with him and if it ever happens again, we will shut it down. We don't care if you're romantically involved with G or not. That's your business. We accept you and love you no matter what.\"",

        "content": "My (31f) daughter's (10f) dad (34m) is in jail again. A little background, her dad and I had her when I was 20. The relationship didn't work out. Her dad has a lot if mental health issues coupled with drug and alcohol abuse. \n\nHe loves our daughter, but he's been in and out of jail since she was born. The longest has been 9 months and at the time I told her that her dad was on a work trip. About 5 years ago we moved from the town we all lived in to a city about 5 hours away. He consented to the move as I would be getting a better paying position and I would be able to attend the University with work helping to pay schooling costs. At the time of the move he wasn't doing well. \n\nAt some point when he had her at his place back when we lived in our old town, I went to pick her up at the scheduled time, and no one was answering the door and he wasn't answering his phone, but I could hear the TV on. It was about 30 minutes of me knocking, calling his parents, etc and he finally answered and said he had fallen asleep. He was either drunk or hungover. \nAfter the move, I would only allow him to have her at his parents that I trust, when she visited, so that I knew she was safe. \n\nFast forward to today, there have been times when we didn't hear from him for 6 months, and times when he was actively involved and doing better. My dad/ her grandpa passed a couple of months ago. The funeral was held in the town we used to live in even though he and my mom moved to the city we are currently in, as that's where most of his friends and family live. Two days after the funeral he gets arrested again. This time, I explain to our daughter that her dad was in jail and why (in a kid appropriate manner). \n\nHe was out within about a month but then this morning I get a video chat request as he is in jail again on new charges. Just last week after he got in a fight with his girlfriend he called me and left a sexuality explicit message. Then I find out he made my ex SIL uncomfortable when he was trying to talk to her and her 21 yo friends at the bar. To say I'm fed up with this man is an understatement. I rejected the video chat request and blocked the jail number. \n\nI know he needs mental health support, preferably inpatient care. But he has done that in the past and we always end up back in the same position as before. My daughter loves her dad, but I'm exhausted dealing with his sporadic involvement in our lives. How do I set boundaries here? I always tell him that he won't have her physically (phone calls are allowed) until he gets back on the right track. He eventually does, then we end up in the same position 6-12 months later. \n\nWhat do I do here?",

        "content": "Just as the title says; I (22F) don't wanna be a mom to my (2M) child. Parenting causes a lot of stress that I can't/struggle to deal with. Been on all sorts of medications to help cope with it all. Even still I don't want to be a mother and truly I never did.\n\nI had a shitty pregnancy, shitty labor and an awful 2 years. It makes me not wanna be a mom; I don't think I'm emotionally, financially or mentally ready. I haven't really bonded with my son and I am unsure how to because of my shitty childhood. When he cries it immediately makes me stressed beyond belief, my physical health is shit. I can't even take care of myself well. I feel like I was pressured into it by those around me and of my circumstances.\n\nEdit: There are also very specific triggers, like when he throws a tantrum the slams his head into the floor and it salcarew me for multiple reasons. And I can't regulate my emotions when he does that, walking away doesn't help cause then I worry what if he hurts himself and I can still hear him screaming.\n\nIt's a weird mix of emotions, on one hand I don't want a kid (never have) and I desperately want to leave and not be involved with my kid while he can forget.\nAnd when he cries it brings me right back to being with his father and the abuse.\nBut I do love him, just not in a motherly way. He's sweet and very smart, playful and curious.\nI also wish I just had him at a different time in my life, rn in my life is getting a decent job and stable housing but I feel held back bc of my son, I struggle to manage my time with my son and especially since I don't have a babysitter. Thankfully his father watches him majority of the time while I get my shit together.\n\nEdit: I always was adamant growing up I didn't want kids and I did that because the extreme amounts of trauma I had to endure from family and friends. My fear is that I'll pass that on by being a shitty mom.\n\nBut storytime.\n\nThis is gonna be messy and sloppy, its gonna be illiterate and for that I'm sorry.\n\nWe are gonna start this rant/story in 2019; right before the pandemic. I lived in a house of 6-7 people and 4-6 cats. During that time I was working an okay job but I lived in hell. Nojt only was there tons of infidelity and drama at home but I didn't escape it at work as I worked with a roommate. However I do view this as deserved karma cause I also was a shady person then too.\n\nAnyways I started dating one of my roommates (We shall call him BD), and we moved out of there and back into my mom's and got a new job at a grocery store.\n\nLate 2020 hits and the Pandemic is in full swing, mask requirements go ignored and people are coughing everywhere. So I quit my job, my grandfather (who I live next to) is immune-comprimised and if I passed it to him or my mom; idk what would happen but it wouldn't be good. But I cruised by on my savings for a year ish.\nIt was right before Christmas but I found out I was pregnant, my birth control had failed and we got the abortion pill shipped to us. We would have to wait a month for the package to be delivered.\n\nIn Early 2021, BD got a job at a factory and all was 'well'. We were just waiting for the pill and all would return to 'normal'. Well BD started bringing around this girl, hanging out after work for long periods of time. Turns out he was cheating on me, I'm still not sure to what extent but I took him at his word that they didn't do anything sexual. \n\nSo I stayed with him; and when that pill came I found out I couldn't take it, I was a month over to take the pill so it wouldn't have worked/done more damage than good. But we decided to keep the child.\n\n[Which small break here, I don't regret my son; I regret having him at this point in my life and with the person I had him with]\n\nSo we continue thru my pregnancy; BD isn't really interested. I think he only went to 1 ultrasound and none of MY checkup appstoryline.\nWe are now about 6-7months in my pregnancy and BD and Me both get a new job at a retirement  home. It's low-key painful and awful but it paid for our groceries.\n\n[BD is also lowkey abusive, nothing like laying his hands on me but tons of screaming and wall holes]\n\nBD is cheating on me with 2 chicks (1 was for sure the other was maybe just personality) and we work with 1. Obviously I'm not happy but there's not much I can do; I'm due anyday now and I wanted this family. \n\nSo I stayed and sure enough one morning I woke up and I started having contractions.\nSo we go to the hospital and I give birth to our son. The recovery in the hospital was bad; BD wouldn't help me so I was consistently opening wounds and not getting help.\n\nThen when we got home; BD wasn't much help there either. But in a twist of fate 3ish days after childbirth I was back in the hospital with sepsis in my gallbladder. This was a double visit, first time it was gallstones, second one was my whole galbladder\n\nI don't remember a lot about what/how things happened next but; we ended splitting up late 2022. I was fed up with being cheated on.\n\nFebruary 2023 hits and it hits hard. My father passes away, after only seeing his grandson twice. I never truly got to say goodbye and the last words I ever heard him say was a voice-mail of him telling me to visit.\n\nShortly after that  me and my mother have a pretty big fight and I end up moving out of my mom's and into my sister's.\n\nI lived with my sister for a short time and some other family until I was on talking terms with my mom again and moved back in.\n\nWe have now reached 2024; Where I am fighting with my mental health and the fact that i don't wanna be a mom anymore. I fantasize about not being a mom anymore and focusing on stabilizing my life.\n\nAnyways tell me what you think or suggest, hell I just need something",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "So tough love time, no matter the circumstances you did bring this child into the world he's 2 and he's not going anywhere so try to stop fantasizing about not being a mom that ship has sailed.  Focus on things you can change in your life for the better given your current circumstances.  You said you have your son 3-4 days a week which gives you 3-4 days a week to as you say focus on stabilizing your life.  Get into a good routine, work on one aspect of your life at a time.  Figure out how to enjoy spending time with your son, get out of the house with him go for walks or to the playground try to meet moms with kids the same age so you can chat while your kids play.  If you just keep thinking you wish you weren't a mom nothing will change you'll still wake up and be a mom, try to figure out how to find joy in being a mom.  I'm a mom of 3 and I don't enjoy every minute with my kids parenting is also hard work and sacrifice and that's ok and it's not supposed to be enjoyable 100% of the time.  Good luck!",

        "title": "SAHM - Working Spouse Balance",
        "content": "Writing this just to see if I am the one being overdramatic, or my husband. To be clear, he is the sole provider for our family, works 60+ hours a week in electrical construction, and we are living with his family at the moment (extremely stressful)\n\nOur daughter just turned 10 months old and is truly such an easy baby. She has no health issues, is perfectly healthy, and very very easy to interact with and care for. She has been very easy since day one, but I suffer from PPD and we had very early issues with breastfeeding that also induced PP rage. My husband has since told me seeing me struggle with these things \"turned him off\" and created a mental disconnect with me within the first week of us being new parents. \n\nI went back to work 8 weeks after having my daughter because I enjoy working, and being a SAHM is not how I would envision my future. I love my child and appreciate so much the opportunity to spend as much time with her as possible in these formative years, but I also love being alone and doing something just for me. I love interacting with people and working, it has been something I've always enjoyed. I also value having my own income separate from my husband, although our finances are joined. We have been operating on one income for the last 3 months, since moving states to be near his family. He started a new job in that time and I also began taking classes online to finish my degree. I chose to go back to school with the full understanding of added stress and work, so that is not part of this factor. \n\nI have never expressed to my husband a desire to be a SAHM ever in the duration of our relationship. Since being forced to be one, it is almost as if he wanted this setup from day one. He has since turned this into \"I work all day, and just want to come home and not do anything\", and only interacts with our daughter for maybe 10 mins when he first arrives home each day before handing her back off to me and I am then in charge of the entire evening routine so he can go directly to bed after eating dinner. He does get up early for his job, which I am understanding of. \n\nThis means I handle the entire day - all food making, household chores, cleaning, schoolwork during nap times, appointments, grocery runs, animal care - and then also prepare dinner each night, feeding my daughter while also trying to eat my own dinner, bath time, and bedtime routine. I then have to utilize that time afterward for schoolwork, and eventually go to sleep. When then I also have to get up with our daughter if she wakes in the night. I get no time to myself, to do anything for myself, and my husband never tells me anything in regards to thankfulness or appreciation. On top of this all, he complains about the lack of initiation of sexual activity on my part. \n\nWhen he comes home, he never asks about my day, about my schooling, about our daughter, what I may need help with, or even brief discussion about his own day. He wants to be left completely alone until dinner is ready, where he then sits on his phone the entire time, does not engage with me or our daughter, and then either hops on his xbox or goes to bed, where he spends hours just scrolling on his phone. When I finally come to bed, if hes not already asleep, he stays rolled to his side away from me on his phone. He only addresses me if he wants to have sex or requests a bj. To which he complains when I express my exhaustion and need for sleep. \n\nI am just so lost and disheartened. I want desperately to be better for my child than my parents were - absent, selfish, manipulative - and I thought he wanted that as well. I understand his pressures as a man in this world and society, but it would be nice to feel like an appreciated wife, mother, and partner than a hired nanny or a trapped housewife from the 1950s.",

Recently this has taken a dramatic step in the wrong direction.   Because of these troubles we take him to our family counselor once a week.  We cannot get him to talk to us about anything serious.  He's a cheerful kid at all times except when he's being disciplined.\n\nHe is constantly in trouble at school for bullying others and some mild sexual harassment.  He touches both girls and boys alike as he says are \"jokes\" but of course this is a huge issue.  The lastest even was him bringing a vape into class which got him into alternative school.  He bought the vape off another kid at school.  \n\nThe previous weekend during a rare few days of not being grounded he stole alcohol from a nearby convenience store.  I took him there afterward to make it right and apologize to them for the trouble.  \n\nWe have been pushing him to complete his homework lately on a nightly basis which is always a challenge.  He gets very angry and upset when we force him to do his homework.  He went to the school counselor and told her her had some very specific plans for suicide because he was so unhappy with the situation.  We sat down with the school counselor and his counselor and decided it was time for a psychiatric evaluation and he was admitted for 5 days or so at a youth mental health facility.  I would say he had a positive time there.  We had a follow up with a psychiatrist who told us this is likely DMDD.  He's taking a few medications now which I don't think have helped the situation yet.\n\nTonight he threatened suicide again as his mom was trying to get him to do some homework.  He refused to speak with us and only would speak with a counselor, so he did that for a while.  30 minutes later no homework and he's very cheerful again.\n\nI have been a stepdad for about 3 years.

        "title": "Dad with 13yo Possibly Gay Son Looking for Advice",
        "content": "So, my Son is a 13yo and I believe he may be gay. Now myself, I was raised in a 3 bedroom house about 900sqft with my Great Grandma, Grandma, 4 sisters, a gay cousin and an uncle. I was pretty feminine to say the least lol, but I knew I was attracted to women. I was just around women so much that I had some feminine ways when I was a a pre-teen. However once I got to middle school around 7th grade and started hanging around more males, I kind of grew out of it (sorry if that offends anyone, not trying to).\n\nI am a pretty lighthearted person so sorry for my lol's here. I love to laugh and joke, and I mean no one any harm. I kind of knew he may be gay when he was younger. But he also could just be feminine. When he was young the first person that suspected something was his godmom.  She was like, \"I think he may be (doing one of those old school hand gestures) lol.\" His mom was highly offended (she is a Baptist Christian). I just kind of thought nothing of it, the uncle who raised me was gay, my stepson is gay, one of my favorite cousins is gay, so I don't have the same issues she has, because some of the people most important in my life were/are gay. My mom is a lesbian too. \n\nFast forward, my son joined the church choir and played the tambourine lol. He also has gay friends. Being a straight guy I don't have any gay friends, just the family members. When my stepson came out (Bi-Sexual), I was kind of upset at first. But as time went on I realized he's really the same person he just likes men sometimes lol. So I still accept him as my son. I've been in his life for 8 years, and I am very proud of the person he has become. Now he's off to college and we talk for about an hour 4-5 times per week, I send him allowance, clothes and games (we are HUGE gamers in my house, just whooped my kids last night in Smash Bros lol), and we still play online when he has time for his old man lol.  \n\n\nOh key point here, I just got custody of him (biological son) maybe a week ago. Other than that it's been visits and sleepovers for the past 5 years, as for 3 of 5 of the past few years (now in IT, so I have much more time to spend with my kids) I was an over the road trucker, and that hurt my son so much. He missed me so much and even though we're in a good place now, it makes me tear up thinking of the pain he expressed to me when I was gone... He has lost a great grandmother and grandmother, and he still has a lot of that pain and hurt. And his mom will not put him in therapy.   \n She told me he was in therapy, he told me he hasn't seen his therapist in about 8 months. Also he takes meds for ADHD, and when she sent him to my house, conveniently the fill date was ripped off, but his mom, I'll save for another post. \n\nSeeing how he interacts with my wife and stepdaughter on a regular basis, parts of his personality that I hadn't seen before are showing themselves (may have always been, I can admit after I would got off the road I was beat, so I'd spend some time with them but sometimes it would be midweek and they'd be at school, I was over the road 3 weeks at a time and home for 48-72 hours).\n\nHis mom called me last night concerned, saying he got a facetime on his phone at 1030 at night (he left his phone at moms), and she answered and it was a kid that she said, \"clearly was gay.\" She wants us to have a talk with my son about his sexuality.\n\nHere is my fear. My son is religious, his mom's side of the family are EXTREMELY religious. They're a first family. The house they live in was once their family church. They have at least 3 generations of pastors in their family. They believe homosexuality is an abomination and all of that. I want to have a conversation with her about this before we talk to him, to see where her head is, and whether or not I should be having this conversation with him, then relaying the information to her. I do not believe in God. I believe if I am honorable, always try my best, and try to help others if there is a heaven I'll get there. I don't need God to be a good person. \n\nWe are black. So what I fear is... We already have so much against us, and this is in addition to for him. I'm not blaming him or trying to change him (if he is gay), I just fear the idiots out here in the world, and what this may do to his relationship with his mother and family, as well as criticism he will receive, and the hate he will receive. As a father, I can do my best to try and prepare him, but not being homosexual, have no lived experience to draw from. I know he WILL need therapy if he comes out, because I don't think his mom's side of the family will take it well to say the least.\n\nHow can I prepare my baby boy for what is coming his way? I don't care if he's gay. Loving him and his mental health is what is most important to me. And what are some things I can do as a dad to make sure that I support him against his family if they don't take it well?\n\nI appreciate any help. And thanks for reading this book long post lol.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "So first of all, feminine does not equal gay. Second of all, maybe you being a straight guy and only having straight friends is more of a reflection on you as a person, and not on the fact that you\u2019re straight. Regardless of mom\u2019s family, YOU need to do the work yourself. You say you were upset after one son came out as bisexual. Your son will pick up on these things.

        "content": "This is so hard to write, but I'm going to just get it all out then maybe edit later.\n\nSo, the long version. (Edited significantly - you're welcome)\n\nMy oldest bio kid, now 16, had the same bestie from age 8. Very soon after meeting, the two kids became a trio with besties older sibling. From when bio was 11 the 2 extras were part of our extended family - we took them on family holidays, spent special occasions together, and every Christmas we bought presents for the whole family.\n\nEventually, after moving in with their Dad after their mum couldn't handle them any more (I never saw any of the behaviour she described mind you) older child revealed they had been physically, sexually, and emotionally abused by family members. I called the police and made a report, an action which meant younger sibling lived with this for a few weeks while home was being made safe.\n\nSadly, that was the last time younger stayed with us. They had also been abused but denied it. However, the abuser confessed and there were texts between siblings that acknowledged the abuse. The blamed us for telling the police. My bio kid was devestated to lose their friend/cousin/sibling, and took a good few years to start to trust in people again.\n\nAfter a few practice runs they decided to come live with us, as their mother wouldnt take them back. In fact, both parents signed parental rights over to myself and my husband.\n\nA few years go by. Kiddo is diagnosed with CPTSD and several severe mental health related conditions as well as being autistic and ADHD. My husband and I juggle work/caring so one of us is home 24/7, although I can never work full time. Our two bio kids then ourselves are also diagnosed AuDHD. Covid hits, and the extent of my bio kids disabilities becomes clear. We spend thousands of $$ and hours on diagnosis and treatment for all three of our kids. This year, things started to look better. Financially we are struggling a lot more but as a family we are getting stronger and happier. This is hard for oldest because they feel they don't deserve to be happy, and their conditions mean they are resistant to treatments for their issues. We are still working on finding the right combo of meds but it seems hopeful that once we get that sorted, everything else will follow.\n\nIn July, oldest asked me to take them to hospital because they were suicidal. We had an awful experience and vowed to do anything before we went there again. We found a new therapist oldest seemed to bond with and tried new drugs.\n\nMonday gone we ended up in ED again, and the treatment this time was even worse - literally, the things the \"mental health nurse\" said are on any list of \"things not to say to a suicidal person\". We ended up coming home after many hours in the waiting room because they wouldn't admit us for... Reasons unknown that amounted to \"we don't think you are really going to kill yourself\". The crisis seemed to have passed, child spoke to therapist, I arranged to see psychiatrist and we are checking on child every hour or so until well after they are asleep to make sure they are tracking ok.\n\nThursday I am at work, husband leaves the house for 30 minutes to collect 16yo from an activity. When he gets back, child tells him they have overdosed. On approx 12 000 mcg of anti psychotics.\n\nThey almost died.\n\nThey spent 2 days and nights unconscious. My husband or I took turns being in the hospital or at home with the other kids every minute. They were in a short stay bed off the ED, so we slept in plastic chairs and startled awake everytime something beeped. Child woke up after that but was actively hallucinating - no idea where they were, why, nothing. After about 24 hours straight of hallucinating the hospital said the drugs had cleared their system and they would be discharged. While hallucinating. With no idea if they were still suicidal.\n\nMy husband and I pulled out every trick in our book. Duty of care. The terrible care we had been given earlier in the week. I looked up guidelines and policy for our state, which the hospital was blatantly failing, but policies aren't law! I called the mental health care hotline (just as gatekeeping of admission as the ED). Finally, FINALLY, I got someone to admit we had a legal right to see the risk assessment they had \"absolutely done!\" (Without speaking to psychotic child or us). Suddenly, he was given a 24 hour hold.\n\nWe slept last night, knowing he was safe. As it is a weekend, the dr's let him stay because they couldn't be arsed with paperwork for discharge. Tomorrow is a new argument, for why he needs to stay in (he says what they want to hear but doesn't mean a woRd of it, which he will admit if asked - no one ever asks). I went to see him today and we wrote down what he doesn't say so we can prove he is still unsafe - he says he's not sorry and if the urge comes to him again, he will try again and get it right. I am fully prepared to take it as far as I have to to keep him safe.\n\nBut... I don't understand. I don't. We love this young person so fucking much! They says they know that, say they never doubt it... So why do they want to leave us? How could they do this to us, breaking us like this? I am trying so hard to be strong for them and I know it's not theirfault, it is a product of the abuse plus faulty brain wiring, but why aren't we enough for them to want to stay? I don't think they understand what a big deal this is - they said they had to be out by Thursday the go to siblings graduation, that they didn't want to miss it. I totally shouldn't have, but I said that if they diEd they would miss every event, not just that one. Then they asked how sibling is - the one who considers you their best friend? The one who has been afraid to go to school for weeks in case you die when they are there? The one who couldn't stop crying for the past few days? That one? How do yoU THINK they are?\n\nI didn't say that. I made a kinda grunt. Apparently they asked their dad why I am acting weird with them. Um, Because  I am terrified and angry and sad and betrayed and numb? \n\nI honestly don't know what happens next. What do you say to your child you love so much, who you would kill for, die for, but who says they \"wanted to see their grandad again\" is why they tried to die? How do you still love them with everything you have when you know your heart could be ripped out of you at any second? They had hidden the tablets over a longish period, which is how they got them, as we THOUGHT all the meds had been locked up so nice July. We bought a safe today for all blades and meds. But if they stay resistant to treatment, how do we make them engage? I mean, we can't, right? How do we ever leave them alone again, let alone leave the house! All the therapists and experts have said we are excellent parents - how can we be if they still want to die? But I swear there is nothing left to give - we are empty. We have given everything - held nothing back. But we have failed \n\nWhat do we do now?",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "I\u2019m so sorry this happened and I\u2019m so sorry that your child is feeling like they are in such a dark place. It does seem like the hospital is not following best practice and that makes this extremely difficult situation even harder. I\u2019m a mental health professional and it seems to me that your child would benefit from an extended inpatient stay. Have you been working with your local community mental health? They may be more helpful than the hospital. It sounds like you are doing everything in your power as a parent and the services you are trying to get are being blocked from you. That\u2019s a systems issue. I do recommend if you end up in a position where they discharge your child that you absolutely provide the level of supervision with them that you would a very small child. If they still have suicidal thoughts, you are not out of the woods. You have not failed. Serious mental illness is a huge challenge. I hope you will be able to access the right care for your child very soon.",

        "content": "Here goes... I have always wanted to build a family but I have been very careful until now. I have my first son (first child) due any day now. His mother and I only dated seven months prior to conception. I have been in love with her. I have somehow had an anxious attachment style in this relationship and she has had a rather avoidant/disorganized style. \n\nShe hadn't dated two years prior to our relationship, due to a wild, sexually abusive previous relationship. She was devastated when she tested pregnant with me. I was not devastated but I feared what she might do. She said that she wanted to have the baby with me. (She later admitted to looking into abortion, even though we are both strongly against it.) I pretty much gave her my home. I had waves of joy. I did everything to make her feel comfortable (her own space, home projects, put her on my life insurance, worked on her car). We spoke of dreams of the future. I planned on selling my beautiful home to move closer to her family. I do not have close family around to help raise a child. \n\nAfter a month and a half, she ran off to her parents four hours away. Prior to leaving we had some heated arguments and I do hold myself accountable for things I've said. I admit to having a temper but I start off a reasonable conversation talking about feelings. (She was on a trip to Alaska, with girlfriends, two weeks into a missed period. After discussing our finances and how we would afford our child, she went on a pre-planned cruise with girlfriends while telling me to go on my own vacation. She maintains a relationship with a man she dated. She has repeatedly compared me to her last abusive ex. She's a flight attendant and there is more but this already longer than intended). I have been gaslighted throughout this situation and I didn't know it. We went to couples counseling but the counselor gave up on her.\n\nJealousies are normal and can be healthy. I have dealt with them properly in healthy relationships. She has had her jealousy in this relationship also but with a double standard. (she was convinced I bought my house with my ex. She was jealous of my past relationship with my ex and my current relationship with my ex's parents. She would not want me hanging out with my ex and I don't). If I explain the situation to friend, family or attorney, they find reasonable doubt that the child is mine. I never ejaculated in this woman.\n\nShe chose to rebuild a dilapidated cabin on her parents ranch, while struggling financially. (Her mother loves the situation). I have attended doctor's appointments, paid all of the hospital bills, researched vaccines for her and everything else one can research. (It's hard to watch anymore baby videos and read anymore books by myself. I have missed out on so much of the pregnancy). She blames me for the pregnancy yet her family thinks that I am the one who didn't want her and the child. She has told me that I am going to be a terrible father and that I need to \"step up\". She is not going to give him my last name and she is going against my wishes to circumcise him. I am not allowed to make any decisions and I have no rights at this point. \n\nI have been through a lot of unusually bad stuff in my life but I am having trouble coping with the fact that I won't be able to raise my son. I believe that even a two month old baby needs a father's bonding. I cry thinking about my little boy struggling without the relationship that I've dreamed of having with him. The kind of relationship that I had with my father. I accept the relationship with her for what it is now and I've never put up with an avoidant partner before. I fought for it but it was a mistake and I have lost most of my dignity. I do not understand how men live with walking away from their children but I am emotionally exhausted and I am tired of being treated as if I am the most insignificant man in the world by her and her family. I will provide for my son in anyway possible but I refuse to pay $1500 a month in child support and risk losing my home, for a woman who won't let me raise my son. Co-parenting does not seem to be a possibility with her and her family.\n\nI start of my daily prayers with the health of her and the baby.  \nSame story you've all heard, Thank you.",

        "title": "Parents of reddit, AITA for thinking that the kids are not everything?",
        "content": "Hi reddit parents. I need a sanity check.\n\nFirst some context. I (35M) and partner (37F) have two kids, 16months and 3 years. I work an on-site engineering job, she is a GP who currently does part time telemedicine working from home, about 12-15 hours a week . She could be earning more if she decides to go back to work at a clinic, but given our younger one's age she has decided to work from home till she is older. The older one goes to preschool normally. I pay for about 80% of our expenses, which comes from about 70% of my income. She pays for the remaining 20%, which is about 50% of hers.\n\nI am an active and present dad. I have been putting the 3yo to sleep almost every night since she was 8 months old. I screen what shows she can have on screens. I bathe, dress, feed and bring the 3yo to preschool most days. I help with the younger one when needed. Many days I take the 3yo out for dad time so that it's mum and the au pair with the younger one. Every Friday our 3yo stays the night with the grandparents and I take the toddler so mum gets at least one night of good sleep. I've done numerous outings where its just me and the two kids and I feel I can handle them ok. I handle all finance, insurance, automobile, house maintenance related matters, arrange to pay all bills. The partner does all health related stuff (she's a doctor), most of the school stuff, and buys groceries most days. Our kids are doing fine. Healthy, smart kids who are loveable but also push boundaries as all kids do. \n\nWe are very blessed. We earn a comfortable salary, live in a house way beyond what our mortgage reflects because her folks helped us out with that. We have more than enough put away that we never have to worry about our kids college fund. We have an Au pair, so we do very minimal cleaning and cooking, and the au pair helps out with childcare when needed. Her parents live ten minutes away, my parents live 30 minutes away if we ever need any help. Ideally, we sound like we are set up beautifully.\n\nExcept that I feel my partner has unrealistic standards on parenting. In my opinion she feels we literally have to set aside everything for the kids, and we, and our relationship suffers as a result.\n\nExample, my partner is someone who does not do well with little sleep. I've been aware of this from the start and recommended that we sleep train the kids. But she feels that sleep training is evil. Her words, verbatim, are \" sleep training is neglect\". I disagreed, and we fought several times over this, but I've grudgingly agreed to follow along. And so, here we are 3 years later, and both our kids do not sleep through the night without someone with them. Much of the time she uses breastfeeding to get them down, and that has developed an unhealthy sleep cue where they can't go back to sleep without suckling. (I know this is a sleep cue thing because when they sleep with me, they mostly have no problem, they'll go to sleep without suckling). So mum gets bad sleep. I do OK, I can get by with less sleep. \n\nAnother example. Recently our elder daughter came back from preschool with an unreported wound between her legs. We were of course concerned- we had the hospital conduct a sexual assault exam and CPS even investigated, and it was concluded it was most likely accident (saddle injury). The school felt horrible of course- I don't think this was done maliciously. But my wife could not trust the school anymore and withdrew our daughter the next day with no childcare plan in place. It's been a month and our 3yo is stuck at home driving mum and the au pair crazy. Withdrawing if we don't trust the school, fine, but no childcare plan in place - not so fine. \n\nOther examples. She wants to go back to work. But she'll tell me she can't because she can't feel assured that anyone will take care of the kids the way she wants them to (which obviously insults me). She 'wants me to suffer like she does' with the kids. She sometimes thinks the au pair's cleaning is not up to scratch, and when she could be relaxing she'll do extra housework that she feels may not be up to her standards. \n\n And her being deprived of sleep, and with so much stress, obviously has implications on the rest of her mood. She's constantly stressed, angry, impatient, and unhappy, even with me. And we are suffering as a result. We've had maybe 3 date nights in 3 years, had sex maybe 8 times in 3 years. She refuses to go on a holiday or take a trip with the kids because \"it would be more work\". Most days she just has no energy for anything except sit and watch Netflix with me. \n\nIf I ask for some time to go for a run or a bike ride (my hobbies pre parenthood) I get a remark as if I just asked to murder our children. I've gone from 10 hours of activity a week  pre parenthood to less than 2, so not as if I haven't cut back and sacrificed. She'll say she doesn't get the chance for that, and if I reply that if she wants to do something like that I'll gladly support that if she wants, she never takes me up on that offer. In her words, we just have to be ' miserable for 5 or 6 years, and we'll see where our relationship is after that.' I think that with how beautifully we are set up, life should not be this difficult. \n\nI get that my wife really loves and care for our kids, and I admire her for that. But I think somewhere along the way she's forgotten that being a good parent also means making time for yourself and taking care of yourself and your spouse. Our kids are important, but so is self care and so is your spouse. Am I bad father for thinking so?",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "You're not a bad dad for thinking that you and your wife need time for yourselves. Honestly, it sounds like you have a lot of good resources in place like an au pair and grandparents nearby. It seems like your wife still cannot relax though. She sounds like she needs therapy. Perhaps she has some powerful anxiety that is making it hard on her. It also sounds like you could benefit from couple's therapy as well. \n\nBest of luck to you.",

Because we lived in different states, we physically met 2 years later and have been together ever since. We have been through a lot of our own toxic-relationship trauma and we both have childhood ptsd. We got married at 28 and shortly after started our own family. \n\nShe comes from a enmesh family and is the oldest daughter of 3 girls. She says she always had everything she wanted as a child but the only thing she truly wanted was to be understood by her parents and sisters. She was an A+ student, athlete, worked, had a car that parents paid for, and never had any responsibilities until she met me. She\u2019s now an amazing mom of two and pregnant with number three, works a full time managerial job, the best person anyone could ever meet, friendly but respectful, kind, honest and caring (In a nutshell) \n\nI come from a major urban city and grew up going from homeless shelter to shelter, poverty, sexually abused, physically abused by my alcoholic father, emotionally neglected by my hard-working mother, and with my older brother who i think is struggling with his own childhood ptsd and struggles with his sexuality. As I grew older I also played sports, video games, had a bunch of friends and girlfriends to keep me distracted from what was going on at home. Now I\u2019m a husband, father of said children, director position at my job, I\u2019m not an extremist at any point, have 5 years of cognitive behavior therapy experience, diagnosed with anxiety, depression and seasonal depression, on top of that 2 weeks ago i was diagnosed with aortic stenosis (heart disease) \n\nWe got pregnant and had an abortion at 19 years old, numerous situations of betrayal trauma from my part, have been through 3 years of marriage counseling, have had a lot of extended family dynamic issues that caused us to have conflict between each other, we are now in the worst possible situation we could be, physically and mentally. \n\nI told her when we first started dating that my worst nightmare is children in distress. Because of my childhood and everything we\u2019ve been through, for her to tell me that in the worst times of our lives, I\u2019m not sure how to get passed it. \n\nI love her, I truly believe we our soulmates but I don\u2019t know how much we can continue this journey together. Odds have been against us since the very beginning. I know she\u2019s hurting and I feel responsible for her well being, for her to think yet alone SAY the ONE thing that I feel very strongly about as being a HUGE dealbreaker for me.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\nEDIT: I had a conversation this morning with her and she regrets telling me because this was a thought she had 6 months ago. She promised me that she will never harm us or anyone for that matter. I will be reaching out to her OBGYN and see what kind of options we have since she is 6 weeks pregnant. She already sees a therapist once a week. We unfortunately are in an area with minimal family support and we just moved to this state 13 months ago. It\u2019s very difficult for us to trust people with our children, especially since we aren\u2019t familiar with the area. \n\nI don\u2019t want this post to be about me, or my feelings. I made this post for those who are familiar with a situation like this or have advice or support. I don\u2019t need anyone to pick sides, it\u2019s not about picking sides, it\u2019s about being supportive to those in need. I love my wife very much and I would NOT drop her like that, especially if she is at her worst. I want to find healthier solutions that can help both of us and our entire little family. I gave the context about my past because of the severity of the situation. My trigger responses are heightened and I\u2019m not sure what to do in this situation. I love her to death but I would never let her hurt our children or herself. That\u2019s not an option. \n\nThank you to those who provide support and kind words.

We've never heard any problems about the name before.\n\nSometime over the course of meeting a new friend (12 yo f) our kid has changed. This friend is gender fluid, cut her hair to a pixie cut, has written adult erotica about her Karate instructor and is just way to mature. Her friend recently started cutting herself.

        "most_upvoted_comment": "So to address your point about it confusing people and needing to find her in an emergency, from a teacher perspective this is not an issue. I have hundreds of kids every year each with their own name preferences, some use whole names, some use nicknames, a few even use last names. After the first week when I\u2019ve learned their names well I know their nickname and full name. I even tell my students it\u2019s up to them the first name they put in assignments, it only matters that their last name matches what\u2019s in the computer. She\u2019s not the first person to ever use a nickname and Alex is a pretty standard nickname for Alexis that\u2019s no issue at all. \n\nHowever, I\u2019m not sure why your jumping straight to the idea of a legal name change. Kids that age go through different nicknames, some that make sense, some that don\u2019t, but that doesn\u2019t mean you need to go out and start trying to change their legal name. You seem very upset over the idea of using a nickname which is a 100% developmentally appropriate things to do at that age and seem to want your child to make all these super big official changes at only 11 years old. Let her see what fits. If one day she decides she wants to legally change her name then worry about it but right now that idea should not even be a part of the conversation.",

This is so harmful to your Children\u2019s [intrapersonal skills](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&hl=en-us&sxsrf=AB5stBgn2dyBWHdzSAS70mBpwU2oXLpxnQ:1690831491802&q=What+are+intrapersonal+skills%3F&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjks8WT1rmAAxU2k4kEHe0CAywQzmd6BAgaEAY&biw=375&bih=623&dpr=2) as they grow up, and can lead to so man mental and emotional health issues later.\n\nI\u2019m a big supporter of two genders, boys are boys and girls are girls and there is a difference, etc. But why do people think that means that everything about us as people should be as different as possible? At the end of the day we\u2019re still all humans and have so many things in common with one another whether we try to or not. \n\nBoys and men should be allowed to cry and openly express vulnerable feelings w/o being judged! It IS okay for girls and women to NOT want to be mothers, wives, or \u201cladies\u201d!  \n\nIT SHOULD NOT BE OKAY FOR WOMEN TO PHYSICALLY, VERBALLY, OR SEXUALLY HARASS/ABUSE MEN!!!\n\nAnd also if men weren\u2019t supposed to like pretty girly things, then we\u2019d all be extinct because then they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to like women either! And vice-versa!\n\nMy husband loves bright colors and wears pinks, yellows, and purples, etc any time he damn well pleases. He likes singing Kelly Clarkson, Lady Gaga, and Katy Perry songs and he\u2019ll do it in public. He loves our daughter and would gladly attend a tea party with her. And even though it\u2019s driving him nuts physically he\u2019s even growing his hair out just for me, because I like it.  And guess what, he\u2019s still a man while he\u2019s doing it all.\n\nMy son is 7 and loves his long hair and unicorns, glitter, flowers, and recently picked out a Gabby\u2019s dollhouse bed set because he loves that show. But he also loves Minecraft, Mario, Pok\u00e9mon, legos, and superheros.  He loves camo stuff and can\u2019t wait to go hunting with dad for the first time this coming deer season. And he is very aware that this means taking the life of an animal so that we can cut it up and eat it because we ain\u2019t rich people.\n\nMy daughter is a \u2728Princess\u2728, a mermaid, and has to take all of her baby dolls with her everywhere she goes. She also loves to climb, fix things with her tools, making fart jokes, and picking her nose and eating it to gross people out b/c she thinks it\u2019s hilarious. But she\u2019s still Mine and Daddy\u2019s Little Girl, and also can\u2019t wait for her first hunting trip with Daddy!\n\nI was a huge tomboy growing up and didn\u2019t care about dolls or dresses that much. And my mom had to stop putting me in dresses cause I didn\u2019t care if my underwear showed, I wanted to climb things, hang upside down, and play rough and tough games. As an adult I wear lots of skirts and dresses because I like them and they\u2019re the most comfortable, but I still like to be active so I wear leggings under everything. I don\u2019t like wearing bras, makeup, shaving my legs (though I do occasionally because it gets uncomfortable), or putting products in my hair. So guess what, I DONT. But I do like crocheting, sewing, cute little baby things, and \u2728SPARKLY THINGS\u2728. I like video games of all types, I like rom-coms and psychological thrillers. And while I\u2019m not much of a \u201cLady\u201d and would sooner mouth off to or take a man to the ER with me before I\u2019d let them disrespect or put their hands on me;  I\u2019m still a woman, a female, and expect to be treated like a lady to some degree, because I think all people should be treated like Ladies and Gentlemen in a respectful way that makes them feel good about themselves and respected.\n\n\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 Okay that\u2019s off my chest.

        "title": "Is the right approach?",
        "content": "My wife and I took in our 15yr old nephew 2 years ago (now 17) after he presented a lot of problems including; being bullied,bullying others, having severe depression and thoughts of suicidal ideation.  He was attending school but wasn't doing any schoolwork for years and when classes went to zoom during the pandemic, he stop attending completely.  \n\nHe was being raised by his very absent, grandparents (my wife's parents) who have very low drive to do anything and spend every day watching TV and napping (they were in their 50's at the time and now 60).  They never had any house rules, structure or bed time.  I first noticed he was doing poorly in school at age 11 which I immediately offered to pay for tutoring in order to help catch him up to speed with his peers since he lived in Nevada and I live in SoCal.  This was about $220/ week for a tutoring center that guaranteed 1 on 1 tutoring 5 days per week.  I would call him and his grandmother for updates every few weeks to check in to ask how things are progressing.  After 2 years of doing this (without seeing report cards -- shame on me) the grandmother said \"I think you can cancel the tutoring now because it seems he is pretty much all caught up.\"\nSo I called the tutoring center to cancel his membership and out of curiosity asked them when the last session he attended was.  They told me he only attended the first session out of the last 2 years!!  This goes to show the mental gymnastics the grandparents teach him. They were conspiring together to trick me that they were going, not caring that is cost me over $20k. The lessons he learned living with his grandparents were that it is better to appear you are doing the right thing than it is to actually do the right thing.  The grandfather's mantra has always been \"Life sucks and then you die\"\n\nHe spent 14 - 16hrs each day online in his bedroom, unfiltered for years.  He was addicted to porn, was conversing with strangers online and video chatting with them doing who knows what.  Things came to a boiling point when the grandmother was diagnosed with cancer 2 years ago.  We decided to offer him to live with us in a much better area with a great school district which he nervously agreed.  My wife and I have our stuff together financially and relationship wise and have no kids of our own (but never ruled it out completely).  This is why we decided to step in and help.  We have the time, energy, love and resources to help him.  \n\nSince living with us, he has been hospitalized 3 times.  Two times were for suicidal ideation with a plan he wanted to follow through with and one time for severe blackout anger.  \n\nHe has an IEP through his high school and was seeing a therapist multiple times per week.  After his last hospital stay, he completed a 30day in patient program in an oceanside resort like setting and is now in an intensive outpatient program.\n\nHe punched a few holes into a few interior walls of our house the night he was last hospitalized.  He lost his smart phone privileges including apps but still has texts and calling capabilities until he saves enough money to pay for the damage he caused ($250).  He makes $25/wk for taking out the trash and putting the dishes away out of the dishwasher.  So far he has saved 0$ over the last 8 weeks because he spends the money within hours of being payed.  \n\nBefore his phone was taken away, he had a limit of 4hrs / day of \"Tech time\"(metered by our wifi) as long as his homework was done, he attended school and was passing his classes.  This 4hrs did not include texting or calling friends, he could do that without limits.  Setting this limitation was to help him learn restraint, time management and hopefully pursue other interests.  Most of the time it just angered him that he had any limitations at all.  \n\nHe would spend a lot of time on discord and we found he was in sex chat groups and video calling strangers.  This was after we had a long discussion about appropriate behavior online, things to be aware of and protect his identity online.  He has a STRONG interest in meeting girls online that turns sexual very quickly, sometimes within minutes.  We decided to remove social media privelages until he progresses further in his mental health treatment plan.  He has no male friends and gets very agitated around them.  The friendships he does make with male peers last days or weeks before blowing up over something and sometimes getting violent.  \n\nHe has had a lot of diagnostic testing. Autism has been ruled out. He has low intelligence, major depressive disorder, low self esteem and general learning disorder. He has terrible hygiene (doesn't brush his teeth, showers once a week, doesn't shave) He is physically normal (6' 1\" 220lbs) but doctors have said he has the social tendencies and social intelligence of a 8 - 9 year old with the body and testosterone of a big teen. He has stated that having a girlfriend will fix a lot of his problems and that having a gf is one of his therapy goals.\n\nThis weekend he asked for social media privileges and explained that all of his friends have no limitations for tech use.  I asked him to tell me one friend that is doing well mentally that has unfettered access to the Internet with no guidelines or limits.  His response was \"Every kid has mental health issues!\" I responded by saying \"Thats not true and I told you that you can have all of those privileges of your phone when you pay for the damages in the house you caused and start paying for your phone.  I will help you look for a job to earn some money to pay for the phone.  That way you are in control of it but have to maintain the responsibility of earning money for it.\". He flipped out and said \"No one is hiring 17 year olds with no experience!\" I said \"There are 4 fast places nearby with help wanted signs up.\" He said \"We'll I'm not working fast food, it's too stressful\" he then threw out a bunch of curse words and slammed his bedroom door.\n\nI am leaving a lot of other instances and details out.  My wife and I are holding it together for each other but wonder if there is ever going to be a point where he can have full autonomy and balance in his life.  We wanted to help straighten his life and help him with his depression and education, not realizing he has extreme anger and bullies his peers because of his size and attitude. We were not / are not prepared for helping him as a life long endeavor but have committed to helping him as long as he is working towards bettering himself and his position.\n\nFeel free to chime in, ask questions and give advice.",

        "content": "Trigger warnings for any formerly hurt children:\nI had a terrible childhood. Beatings, starvation, sexual assault, emotional abuse, neglect, murders, everything you can imagine, I had a taste of. And I grew up in a cult. I got married young and had a child. \n\nWhen my daughter was born my life changed. I felt love for the first time. I became alive. I was so attached to this tiny human, she never had to cry because I was always there, solving whatever problem she might have. She was the happiest baby anyone had ever met. Full sunshine, and always looking up at me with this smile on her face like I was amazing. So I tried to be.\n\nMy life wasn't good enough for her. I left the abusive marriage, but my planned safety nets all broke and we ended up homeless and impoverished and stranded. And then something in me broke. My entire brain broke, first of all. I had a psychotic break, probably long overdue. I was admitted to a mental hospital and when I came out we'd gotten an apartment and I secured an income etc, but the connection to my daughter was gone. \n\nI kept going as I had been, assuming it would come back. I KNOW I love her. I just don't feel it. I don't feel anything.\n\nShe's a teenager now. And she's showing a lot of the expected signs of a child who isn't loved. I might have done my best to just power through and get back on track, but my heart has been closed off ever since. Our connection was gone. \n\nMy own journey since then has probably been about as good as a poor single parent could do it? I tried the mental health way, but the antipsychotics were making me sleep so much, so when she was six I had enough of being a sleepy mess and quit them. I tried an antidepressant mainly because my doctors were threatening me with \"The System\" if I didn't comply and take *something* and it helped me a little at first and then it turned off all emotion completely. So I quit those too.\n\nI found a way to get therapy. It's helped a lot. I found out I have c-ptsd (and ofc some regular PTSD too) and I've been becoming much more human, more regulated, less triggered. I had a couple of short term spiritual awakenings. My former doctors were very shocked by all the healing that happened.\n\nBut the connection to my daughter is still lost. I try to do things with her but I'm so detached. She likes going places with me but my energy is just so low. I know in my mind that I love her, but my heart is numb. I have a handful of years left to fix this somehow, but I don't know what else to do. I've improved everything about my life that I could think of. I have:\n\nTrauma awareness and healing\nIncome\nStable housing\nHealthy, vegetarian eating\nLow stress \nA pet\nSpiritual practices\n\nI can feel as I'm writing this that the list isn't... Right. Something is missing. I'm hoping that by finally overcoming the shame enough to post this, to honestly admit that I'm lacking, that someone can see what is wrong. Tell me what you see is missing, please. What can I do. Where are my blind spots. How do I feel the love that I have for her?\n\nShe deserves to be loved, she's so good. Help us.",

        "title": "Toxic mother issues (TW: mentions of self harm, Sa, & suicide ideation)",
        "content": "This is a long one, I'll stick a TL;DR at the end. TW due to referencing how I got pregnant, and what my child's been up to (self-harming & suicide ideation). \n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI (37f) was raised by an exceedingly toxic undiagnosed narcassistic mother (NM, 68), who gaslit me, abused me financially and emotionally, and ran a thirty-plus year campaign to alienate myself and my younger brother from our dad, whom she divorced when I was around 19. (It's taken years, but my dad and I now have a great relationship!) \n\nI relied on her for everything, due to mental health conditions and, after awhile, physical disabilities (chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia). She took the entirety of my ESA, demanded half my DLA, and when I took my Master's degree (remotely) she wanted over half of my student loan. I honestly believe she has a spending problem, as she's *always* buying new (and pointless) things. \n\nWhen I was 25 I was sexually assaulted (on my birthday of all bloody days) and wound up pregnant. I was coerced into keeping the baby (plan had been adoption) (\"Thank you for giving me my first grandchild\" yeah, cuz *that's* not coercive at all \ud83d\ude44). For the first two-and-a-half hellish years - no hyperbole, my kid needed surgery, had cholic, and violent night terrors - I was a single mum, even though I was living with NM as my carer (countless mental illnesses plus physical disability). \n\nEverything that needed doing with my kid was done by me - even though throughout the pregnancy NM had sworn up and down that we would do everything together \"as a team\". She would frequently promise to give me the chance to nap during the day (I'm not exaggerating when I say I was averaging about three hours every night) but always had a reason why she couldn't (\"oh, I'm sorry, I overslept\" or \"I had a stomach ache\" or \"I had a migraine\" etc etc etc). I was so sleep-deprived that *my kid's* doctor pointed it out as a concern to him, and rushed a referral through to the sleep clinic. Unfortunately unhelpful (TM overruled all the advice from the clinic as soon as we got home) but the thought was heartwarming to me; *somebody* noticed how hard I was struggling. During that time period, *she* got sick (still don't know what with) and she expected me to be looking after *her*, too. So, at that point, I was getting significantly less sleep (I was basically starting to hallucinate things, I was that sleep deprived). \n\nAs soon as the nighttime issues eventually subsided, NM swooped in. I wasn't able to parent my child the way I planned, as any rule or boundary I put in place was overridden by her (\"I've already raised two children of my own, and helped raise two others. *I* know what I'm doing.\"). Our relationship (mine and NM's, and mine and my child's) started deteriorating rapidly. \n\nFast forward a few years and I meet, then get together with, my now-fianc\u00e9e. She's an amazing woman, whose child is now in their 20's and is an absolute gem of a human being. I'm not exaggerating when I say she saved me, and my relationship with my child. We moved in together, and became a little family (her, myself, and my child, as hers stayed in their hometown for college). Things were a little rocky as my child had to settle into a new life, but things smoothed out. They were excited about the marriage, about getting adopted by my fianc\u00e9e (\"She loves me so much she *chose* me!\"). Things weren't perfect, but they were *good*. \n\nThat's when NM started her campaign against us. \n\n+ She reported us to social services on more than one occasion with \"concerns\" about how my child was being raised/the household they were raised in/the fact my fianc\u00e9e's (teenage) child was living back in their hometown/my fianc\u00e9e had committed benefit fraud etc etc (info verified by my child, whom she told, though told *me* when was in hysterical tears about it, \"It would *never* be one of *our* family\").\n+ She said to my face more than once I'm am unfit mother. (Told my fianc\u00e9e the same.) \n+ She told my child frequently that I was parenting them \"wrong\" (again, information verified by my child). \n+ Frequently gaslit my child into thinking that they had done something wrong every time she threw a fit over their crappy behaviour that *she* encouraged.\n+ Literally bought my child's favour by purchasing them anything and everything they wanted (something that a disabled person on Universal Credit like me can't do, but she never had any problems with taking out credit cards. Or getting me to, but that's a whole other nightmare). \n+ Taught my child that material gifts were the only \"true\" proof of love. \n+ Turned my maternal family - including my beloved little brother - against me. \n\nThat's just a small selection, but I'm sure you get the picture. Life was *awful*; my child treated both myself and my fianc\u00e9e like crap, said downright vicious things, the whole kit and caboodle.\n\nAfter a few years of this I said \"fuck it\" and went completely no contact with NM. It wasn't overnight, but the change in my child was *immense*. The arguments simmered down to the usual kind families have, they were interacting with us, they were once again excited at the prospect of my marriage and their adoption by my fianc\u00e9e. It wasn't a perfect life, but it was *lovely*. Friends of the family commented, apropos of nothing, that my child had drastically changed for the better, that they were a delight to be around; happier, brighter, more stable, kinder. \n\nThen I get a thick paper package in the mail.\n\nNM filed a child abuse case with the court, claiming that I was emotionally and psychologically abusing my child, and that she was suing for custody. I fell apart mentally and emotionally (yay for severe mental illnesses care of TM), but kept myself going - I mean, I had a kid, what else was I going to do other than fight for them? TM had already irreparably destroyed me, like hell I was going to let her do that to my child. I gathered up the evidence of NM's toxic behaviour, statements from different family friends about how my child's behaviour and attitude had changed drastically for the better since their lack of contact with TM, the works. \n\nAt the first hearing, even with all the evidence presented, the judge decided to let NM pursue the case. His entire attitude throughout was \"you womenfolk should be sorting this out between yourselves rather than wasting the court's time\", but hey, he was an older gent from a different generation, so I cut him some slack. We had a family court child officer (Cafcass) come to talk to myself (as the accused), my child, and NM (as the accuser). Again, I shared evidence showing that I didn't do any of the things I was accused of, and explained that I was genuinely concerned that NM's presence in my child's life would be detrimental to them. NM, in turn, claimed she only wanted visitation rights and that *I* was detrimental to my child's wellbeing due to my aforementioned disabilities. I'm not sure *exactly* what my child said when interviewed, though I was made aware they were interested in seeing NM so they could get things and see the family cats, though only briefly. \n\nOff to the final hearing. Judge opines that he feels children should be able to spend time with their grandparents (we see my dad regularly, and my soon-to-be-in-laws as often as possible, given they aren't local, so they *were* spending time with grandparents, just not *her*). He then asked NM if she was willing to drop the case. NM told him no, that she was still filing for custody (not what she'd told the Cafcass officer, but I guess the judge didn't read the full report or something). He asked me the same question, and obviously I told him I would not be handing my child over to NM. Judge then explained that since we couldn't come to a compromise, the case would have to go to a full jury trial. NM enthusiastically agreed. \n\nLike hell was I putting *my child* through a jury trial, so I unwillingly conceded that NM could see my child, with conditions: she wasn't to have my child for multiple nights, and that she was to stop defaming myself and my fianc\u00e9e to or around my child. Long story short, the judge ended up granting her overnight stays every other weekend, a week over the Christmas period, and two weeks during the summer holidays. So much for my conditions. \n\nSince my child has been seeing NM again, the little family relationship we had has shattered. My child is self-harming (I have to do regular checks for pencil sharpeners, as they remove the blades from them), acting out at school (giving the teachers lip, refusing to do homework/schoolwork), has started stealing things from myself and my fianc\u00e9e (whilst simultaneously denying doing anything, even when caught), and admitted to me that they've been considering unaliving themselves. The relationship between my fianc\u00e9e and my child has deteriorated to the point that they barely interact, and when they *do* it's usually an argument, and *my* relationship with my child is rocky af and filled with lies (on my child's part). NM has returned to overruling any and all of the rules I put in place, including the one where I said *under no circumstances* was my child to own a practice balisong/butterfly knife. Guess who bought one for my then-11-year-old's Christmas present? \ud83d\ude44\n\nTo make things more difficult, my child is now 12 and going through puberty, *and* has discovered they're trans. Balancing that, with the self-harming, and the honestly downright cruel way she's treating myself and my fianc\u00e9e, and we're at our wits end. We don't have the money to take NM back to court to contest the ruling, and I'm bound by the court order not to badmouth NM or keep her from seeing my child (not that I'd done so before, but whatever). I *very strongly* suspect, from things my child has said to us, that NM is very much *not* keeping her end of the order up. \n\nI'm honestly at a loss as to what to do. My family is falling down around my ears and there doesn't seem to be a single thing I can do to stop it. How tf can one NM cause so much pain?? \n\nTL;DR - my NM is systematically destroying mine and my fianc\u00e9e's relationship with my trans child, and thanks to a court order I can't get her out of our lives, even though her presence is *literally* destroying my child's mental health.",

        "title": "How I won child custody against my narcissistic ex-wife",
        "content": "Hello everyone,  \nI am new to Reddit, so I'm not sure if this is the appropriate place to post. I wanted to share my story and provide help to men who are going through tough times, particularly those who have lost child custody or are fighting for it against their ex-partners. This is a long read but I hope it helps.  \nI understand that everyone's situation is unique, and they have their own reasons for losing custody of their children. I'll briefly share my own experience. During a difficult period in my life, the day after my grandfather, who was my best friend and role model, passed away, my ex-wife provoked a fight with me. She wanted to push me to the point of physically hurting her, so she could call the police, have me arrested, and take away my child. Fortunately, I didn't abuse or harm her as she hoped. It escalated to some pushing and shoving, but the responding officer saw a different story and didn't arrest me. Instead, he advised me to leave for the night. Two days later, my ex-wife obtained an Emergency Protective Order (EPO) from the courthouse without any evidence of abuse. This turned my life upside down and gave her complete control over our child.  \nWe had a 1.5-year-old son whom I loved dearly. My ex-wife knew how much he meant to me, and she used him as a way to hurt me. Although our relationship was rocky, and we argued frequently, physical altercations were rare. We had been together for seven years and married for five. When she obtained the EPO, she took our son to her parents' house while I was at work. That night, the police informed me that I couldn't have any contact with her or my son until the court date. I had hoped that this situation would be resolved quickly, and my son would be removed from the EPO since I posed no threat to him. Unfortunately, the legal system was overwhelmed due to COVID-19, resulting in court dates being weeks or months apart.  \nFor eight months, I was only granted limited parenting time of 8 hours per week, which felt unfair considering I had no charges or criminal record. I believed I should have equal say and custody of my child. I spent the next 10 months fighting to see my son again and disprove the false accusations made against me. I had to prove my innocence in court, even though I was the one who was guilty until proven innocent.  \nAfter the EPO was dropped two months later, I thought I would finally be able to see my son and have equal rights as a parent. However, the following months involved exchanging affidavits and expensive lawyers to prove my fitness as a parent. We eventually chose a legal mediation/arbitration route, submitting all our documentation to an arbitrator/mediator for a decision.  \nNow, I understand you're interested in how I won shared custody despite my ex-wife's efforts to limit my parenting time. I had to prove that I was an involved parent since day one and would continue to be. Despite her accusations of abuse, I had to show that I had \u201cchanged\u201d and would never repeat any past mistakes, if the judge believed even an ounce of her bs!  \nThe first step was to challenge the EPO by proving her lies. I gathered evidence such as screenshots of her social media posts, where she expressed love and admiration for me. I collected text messages, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook conversations that showed her affection towards me and my involvement as a parent. I also documented the negative exchanges we had, where she appeared as the aggressor. Additionally, I obtained screenshots of conversations between her and my sister and close friends, where she spoke positively about our marriage and me. I secured the transcript from the day she obtained the EPO, which revealed inappropriate behavior from the judge who mentioned \u201ccourts favor women mostly in these kind of situations\u201d, so quickly granted the EPO without proper evidence.   \nWe ended up taking our child custody battle out of the court system and went through a legal Mediation/Arbitration route where we submitted all of our documentation to arbitrator/mediator, who overlooked our case and made the ultimate decision.   \nSo now I know you\u2019d like for me to actually get to the point of how I actually won shared custody despite all her efforts to not increase any of my parenting time after all those months. I essentially had to prove that I was a fit parent, who was actively involved in my child\u2019s life since day one and will continue to be involved in my child's life. Even despite her accusation of me abusing her for years and her claiming that I was abusing my son. I made it so that even if the arbitrator had some belief in her ridiculous accusations of abuse, that I was now a changed man and that any claims that were against me in the past can be put aside and that I would not ever do that ever again.  \nI looked through our text message exchanges and WhatsApp and IG chat and FB posts as to where she was showing me love and affection and saying kind things to me, and also showing that I was an active parent as well. I also noted all the bad text exchanges we had where she would look like the aggressor and abusive/manipulative one in the relationship. I then got screenshots of conversations between her and my sister and some of our close friends where she\u2019s stating how happy she is with me and how she believes our marriage is amazing and loves me so much etc.. I got a copy of the police report of our incident and that also provided some vital information as well. When the officer asked if I\u2019ve abused and kicked her or choked her or sexually assaulted her ever, she stated \u201cno\u201d. This was all helpful in the trail. In my affidavit I gave some background input on my profession and how our family dynamic worked as to childcare and how she had a tendency to act impulsively and use our son as a pawn to manipulate me and get things the way she wanted too. Matter of fact during our altercation by brother came upstairs from the basement and I immediately told him to start recording, the video showed that I was pulling our son away and that she was in fact the aggressor.  \nIn court, I presented all this evidence along with character witnesses, including family members, friends, and colleagues, who could vouch for my parenting abilities and good character. I also enrolled in anger management classes and therapy to demonstrate my commitment to personal growth and addressing any underlying issues that may have contributed to past conflicts.  \nFurthermore, I hired a skilled and experienced family law attorney who guided me through the legal process, advised me on the best course of action, and helped present my case in the most compelling manner. My attorney helped me navigate the complexities of family law, ensuring that my rights as a parent were protected and that the court recognized the importance of maintaining a strong and loving relationship between a father and his child.  \nDuring the mediation/arbitration process, I continued to provide evidence of my involvement in my child's life. I documented every interaction, phone call, visit, and activity we shared. The consistent presence I made and every effort to be an active and engaged parent, and highlighted this in my affidavit with evidence of the important events, doctor's appointments, and extracurricular activities. I also kept records of financial support and contributions I made towards my child's well-being.  \nIt would be a good idea for all men to enroll in anger management courses and personal development courses online and bring those certificates to court, saying, \"Hey look, I've changed.\" I started to continue with my routine counseling sessions, documenting every single date and time attended. I began seeking free online courses in personal development, parenting, effective communication with my ex, communication with children, and anger management. I learned a lot about Adverse Childhood Events (ACE) in children and how my actions and words can impact a child's development. These are all courses you SHOULD enroll in to better understand your kid and look like a rockstar in front of the judge, I have attached a document showcasing the online and local courses I have completed. In total, I have completed dozens of certificates in personal development, brain development and behavior therapy. I have even earned diplomas in cognitive behavior therapy through online universities. All of this was done to prove that I am a fit enough father to raise my child, despite the ridiculous allegations my ex continues to make.  \nEven with the limited time I had with my son (8 hours per week for a total of 8 months), I made the most of it by enrolling him in programs that coincided with my parenting time. I registered him for swimming lessons, library programs, and attended several parent-child classes through free social support programs in the city. Additionally, I took my child to doctors' appointments for check-ups, even though my ex was already taking him for routine check-ups based on his age. However, my ex started canceling the appointments I made when the clinic called her number to confirm the appointment time. I documented this behavior in my affidavit when requesting shared custody of my child.  \nI also secretly recorded every interaction between us during pick-up and drop-offs using my phone. Numerous times, my ex would act hostile and yell at me. There were instances when my son would cry and refuse to leave my arms, screaming and crying when I had to hand him over. This deeply affected me, leaving my heart feeling dark and cold. However, I always remained composed, never raising my voice or saying anything absurd that she could use against me. Rule number one for all men going through a difficult divorce like I did: keep your cool at all times. The last thing you need is to defend yourself over something as trivial as pressing the doorbell too hard and breaking it.  \nDespite the limited time I had with my son, I started a calendar to record every single thing we did together during my time with him. This included diaper changes, meals, activities, and any observations I made while caring for him, such as behavior changes and tantrums. I also made note of every bruise and scratch on him, as he developed severe eczema after moving to his mother's place. I was genuinely scared and fearful for his safety, as well as concerned about the lack of attention he was receiving. Consequently, I called Child Protective Services to conduct a wellness check on him and the living conditions he was in. Although nothing came of that wellness check, it did scare her and her family, leading them to take better care of my son. No more bruises or major scratches were noted afterward.  \nI kept all the receipts for items I purchased for my son, including toys, clothing, and activities I enrolled him in. Not only did I complete the courses mentioned earlier, but I also showed that I have been an active parent in my child's life since day one. I presented evidence such as old texts, pictures, appointments, and courses I participated in with my son. This included pictures of us at the park, me cutting his nails, or taking him for haircuts. I literally showcased everything in the affidavit to prove that I was indeed a more active parent in our son's life than she was. I retrieved old text message exchanges between me and my ex, discussing vacations, appointments, and even asking about the status of baby formula at home. I also obtained screenshots of text messages between myself and coworkers, requesting shift changes to attend my son's doctor's appointments or seeking help with childcare. Any evidence that demonstrates your past commitment to your child and outlines your future plans to care for them will be crucial during the trial. When writing my affidavit, I wrote about our rocky relationship and how my ex would use my son as a pawn in ways to get things the way she wanted. I highlighted her narcissistic behavior without actually using that word. I highlighted the times she was abusive towards me, by almost pinpointing it to the exact date/time and reason she did it. I lucky took pictures of bruises and scratches I received during these altercations and highlighted every single one during my affidavit.   \nUltimately, the arbitrator/mediator recognized the evidence presented and the positive changes I had made in my life. They concluded that it was in the best interest of the child to have both parents actively involved in their upbringing. The decision granted me shared custody and equal parenting time, ensuring that my child would benefit from a meaningful relationship with both parents.  \nIt was a long and challenging journey, both emotionally and financially. It required perseverance, patience, and a strong support system. But with determination and the right legal representation, I was able to overcome the obstacles and secure a fair outcome for myself and my child.  \nI share my story not as legal advice, but as an example of how one person navigated the process of regaining custody rights. Each situation is unique, and it's crucial to consult with a qualified attorney who can provide personalized guidance based on the specific circumstances.  \nIf you find yourself facing a similar situation, I encourage you to seek legal advice and support, gather evidence of your involvement as a parent, and focus on demonstrating your commitment to your child's well-being. Remember that the court's primary concern is the best interest of the child, and by consistently showing your love, dedication, and positive changes, you increase your chances of obtaining a fair custody arrangement.  \nPlease note that laws and procedures may vary depending on your jurisdiction, so it's important to consult with a local attorney who specializes in family law for accurate and up-to-date information.  \nI wish you the best of luck in your journey, and I hope that my story can provide some encouragement and guidance.

Manipulate me...etc. for sex) which really takes a toll on you, was sexually assaulted (edit: not by my daughter's dad) while I was around 4-5 months which started a whole thing. Just a bunch of asshole teenager shit. By the end of it I just wish I never even went through with it and after years of having my daughter I'm just relaizing all this stuff and things I wish I did differently. When my daughter was 7 months - 2 I was hospitalized inpatient 4 times. I struggle really hard with mental health. I have maternal instincts I always have, I love taking care of my daughter and everyone else in my life. It's what I do it makes me feel better about myself but Jesus Christ I have to do this my entire life with the same little person I gave birth to. All these years of self reflection I know I was not stable and old enough to have a child. I was seeing a psychiatrist but I can't right now due to insurance issues. Literally yesterday I had an appointment but I wasn't allowed to show unless I wanted to pay out of pocket. Whatever. That's for another time. I find myself so irritated all of the time, some of the time I don't even wanna wake up in the morning, I constantly have crying spells, I lost my imagination so young sometimes I don't know how to play with my daughter, like Barbies, whatever crazy things kid come up with lol. Sometimes I forget she's just a kid and kids are kids....so if she's doing a kid thing like I don't know don't know how to twist a damn door knob I'll catch myself getting agitated and have to stop myself and tell myself she's a kid, you have to teach her, she's not a damn ant and is just born and suddenly knows how to climb up walls. I don't know. I need help. I don't know if I actually regret becoming a mom or maybe it's just my mental health making me not to be a mom and do all the responsibilities it comes with. I do not know. I'm very self aware of what I do wrong as a parent. Getting annoyed, yelling, whining (like in a whiny voice if you know what I mean), sometimes I sleep in later than I should, I get really bad anxiety about going to parks lol, I get flustered and overstimulated fast.\n\nAnyways if anyone even got this far....and you struggled with this what is something you do to help. Therapy and psychiatry is out of the picture for now so.",

        "title": "AITA for wanting my ex to not contact our kid (6f) until my graduation in 3wks?",
        "content": "This is going to require a bit of background, so I\u2019m going to try my best to keep it as short as possible. When I (26F) was 19, I became pregnant off of a one night stand with my ex (24M). We stayed together for a year because I desperately wanted my child to have her father involved. It was a miserable relationship\u2014 he compulsively lied, stole things from my elderly grandmother and myself, and by the time my daughter was 5 months old had sold my old car (I was loaning to him to work), my iPhone, my MacBook, a Dell laptop, and a tv for coke. I\u2019d done everything\u2014 gotten him a job with my dad\u2019s company which he showed up 50% of his shifts before he was finally terminated, my family housed us for free while I worked 40hrs/went to college 20 hours while doing 90%+ of childcare and was breastfeeding, while he worked part time at subway and spent the rest of the time lying, stealing, and getting high. \n\nWhen I finally left him, he bought a bus ticket back from TX to CA and I did not hear from him for 4 years. I tried to find him several times, even if just to terminate his parental rights so under the right circumstances, maybe my child could actually have a father one day who loved her. \n\nWhen my daughter was 4.5 he added my mom on FB, and we found out he had spent 4 years in a Christian men\u2019s program. He really had us fooled that his life was together and he wanted to be the dad she deserved. I gave him every chance. And I mean I spent over $1000 flying her across the country to spend 2 days with him while in college with 2 young kids well below the poverty line. I am also disabled with numerous health issues and he knows this. When we first reconnected, I made it very clear to ONLY introduce himself and uproot her stability if he planned on moving back here and being an active father. I even told him that if he did, I would give him joint custody with no child support because my kid is what is important and she deserves a father. \n\nWell, after that one time I flew her out he made every excuse to not come down, and began demanding I let my 5 yo autistic/adhd child go alone with him after meeting him once, for weeks/months. When he didn\u2019t get his way, he stopped answering her calls and I got to pick up the pieces. This coincided with me finding out he had lied for roughly a year about intending to move down here, which he never told his then-gf now-wife (who is young/sheltered by the cult-like church they belong to, has never been in any sexual relationship, etc.)\u2014 the one condition of his involvement. \n\nSince then (1.5 yrs since he saw her once), in the past 12 months he has spoken to her maybe 3 times including 5 minutes on her birthday. My daughter wants her last name changed, which I understand. But he ignores anything unless it comes to something he wants and I would need consent even though he is not involved. After 4-6 months of ignored calls/texts he asked to speak to her. I told him now was not a good time, that I am in my last month of college as a software engineer and I don\u2019t necessarily feel like dealing with the nuclear aftermath of him ghosting her the moment he isn\u2019t getting what he wants. Being an emotional and physical punching bag when I have enough on my plate and have been fighting my nervous system attacking itself amidst everything. He begged and pushed and I lost it. I let him know how much this beautiful incredible child has been fucked up as a result of them being too selfish to move away from their parents to give this child hers. How awful it is that they plan on having more children when he cannot give the minimal amount of effort and love to the one he already has. And I am tired of her heart getting trampled on. \n\nAITA for telling him to wait? And even more so, AITA for considering blocking him and keeping my daughter away? I feel terrible for even having the thought, but I\u2019ve given my all hoping he would be an active father. But an absent father does less damage than a revolving door one dropping off more trauma on your kid every 3-6 months. And I have enough to handle raising them alone. I\u2019m not sure what to think so objective input sounds great right about now.",

        "title": "how to treat 21yo with maturity of 15 yo",
        "content": "My husband and I are at our wit's end with our 21 yo daughter. She has mental health issues and delayed emotional maturity that has been placed at age 14-15 by her long-time therapist. We have been trying for years to follow the instructions of her therapist to help her work toward an independent adult life, but she still has a long way to go. We still have to remind her to do her daily chore of unloading the dishwasher, to practice basic hygiene, to take her psychiatric medication, etc. She is diabetic, yet despite her doctor's warnings she still drinks soda, eats candy, skips medication doses, refuses to do even light exercise like a walk around the block, etc. On top of all this, she compulsively lies for no reason at all, and is so impulsive that it's frightening. When a young man she liked approved her friend request on social media when she was 19, she blew up the phones of mutual friends in the middle of the night, telling them about her plans to get married and making up stories about how I'm bff's with his mom and we've been trying to get them together for years. Over the last few years she has struggled off and on with an Internet pornography habit that I can only describe as excessive and alarming. (At 15 and 16 she was sexting and sending nudes with online predators and giving personal details that put her and the family as a whole at risk; at 18 she was sending sexually explicit texts in gaming apps without even questioning the ages of fellow gamers, etc.) Her younger sisters have been exposed to things we would never want them exposed to as a result of all of this. She sometimes steals, hoards food, picks holes in her skin and plucks out hairs, and struggles with suicidal ideation. At 20 she was terrified for me to leave her home alone for even 5 minutes to check the mail. \n\nAll of these behaviors have necessitated us keeping a closer eye on her than we would otherwise be comfortable with when dealing with an adult child. We have followed her therapist's instructions to the letter\nwhen it comes to the boundaries in place for her, and everything has been by mutual agreement. No part of us enjoys this. This should be the time of our lives that we can enjoy a friendship with her. It's exhausting to have to still be raising someone her age. Despite her emotional and mental struggles, she is highly intelligent, which adds a layer of complexity to the situation. \n\n\nMidway through last year, we believed we were finally starting to see progress in her life. She  got her first job, started taking her first college class, and finally got her learner's driving permit after years of refusing to do any of this. \n\nShe recently began dating a guy a few years older than her. He is highly educated and has a great job. At first, he had us totally fooled, but now it's obvious he is extremely toxic. He is very manipulative and half's her when she calls him out. She has quit therapy, they text and talk on the phone all night and day, and he constantly tells her that we are just trying to control her and she should move out, despite having literally $0 in savings. When he wants to see her, she blows off school and calls in sick to work. When he goes on business trips, she wears the same pair of pajamas for days at a time and lies on the couch for 20+ hrs a day refreshing her email every 20 seconds to see if he messaged her. Every moment he isn't working, she is glued to him. When they have fights, she becomes suicidal. She skips out on family time and breaks commitments to family and friends, then gets angry if people do things without her.  \n\nWe have tried to steer her gently and otherwise  keep our mouths shut about it for fear of pushing her further away and closer to him. It's been 4-5 months and they are completely obsessed with each other. He tells her they are going to get married, but of course there's no ring. (Thank God) She has resisted our suggestions that she consider an IUD or other long-term birth control, in light of the fact that not only has she never wanted children, but her PCP had been clear that a pregnancy in her current state of health could be fatal. She says contraception is unnecessary because they have decided to wait till marriage, which she believes is imminent, and since he wants kids she has decided to have some for him after the wedding. \n\nWhen he visits our home, they constantly overdo the PDA even though her sisters repeatedly express how uncomfortable they are. Even worse, she has become verbally and emotionally abusive to her younger siblings, both alone and in front of the boyfriend. Meanwhile, she confided in me that when they are alone in the car or at his house, he has groped her on several occasions, and they almost had sex twice, once in a car on a busy street in a rough part of town at 8 pm, and once in broad daylight at the lake in a nearby state park. \n\nOur \"rules\" for her are very simple, and most are more like requests. Unload the dishwasher every evening. Help put away groceries. Clean up after herself. Use her laptop for social media and YouTube instead of her phone (per therapist, will help keep her safe from lack of impulse control). Go to school and work as scheduled. Let us know what time to expect her home and call if late.  She pays no rent and yet cannot respect those simple requests. I went shopping with my mother the other day and we ended up at the coffee shop where she works, and I got an earful from another employee about the completely made up sob stories she had been spreading all over town about me and her father. She literally expects me to pack her lunch and drive her everywhere and sit next to her bed while she sleeps because her anxiety is so bad she's terrified, yet is telling her co-workers that I'm an abusive psycho. I just don't know how much longer I can do this. If she was a typical 21yo, we would tell her it's time for her to start paying her share of the bills and start exploring getting her own place. But she's not well. \n\nTLDR: Emotionally delayed and unstable 21 yo daughter wants autonomy of an independent adult, but no responsibilities, and can't stop making destructive choices.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "It's hard and i get it.  My 25 year old has ASD, mental health issues and was developmentally delayed, usually only by a few years but it makes a big difference.\n\nI always treated her at her \"regular\" age and then treated the symptoms of her other issues separately. So, if she wasn't functioning due to depression, we'd manage that. If she was having a hard time holding a job due to social issues, we'd manage that. But she never wanted to be treated younger than her age.  \n\nI understand how exhausting it is.  Keep working with her therapist (does she allow you to be included in sessions?) We did both family and individual once my daughter hit teenager years.  And keep setting goals. Understand that there will be setbacks. \n\nI never thought my daughter would be able to live away from me but a couple of years ago things just clicked. She moved in with some friends and manages her life pretty well now. She still will call me for help sometimes on how to navigate certain situations but does well overall.",

We are fine, her Mom agreed with me, we are in a better position now, but for kiddo's mental health, I will not allow kiddo to be near them, and is the best for we all. Thank you all!",

        "title": "Should I apply for adult guardianship over 18/yo with serious mental health issues?",
        "content": "I have been the unofficial guardian for my younger brother since he was a baby. I have had legal custody for several years now, notwithstanding some brief lapses when he was incarcerated, in therapeutic foster care, or voluntarily living with a parent. In all but name, I am his parent. \n\nLast year, my brother was a missing person. He spent a good portion of the year off my radar, and he only returned to my care at the end of the summer. I can infer, based on his history and declining mental health upon returning, that he put himself in a dangerous situation that meant he was taken advantage of. This is a reoccurring theme in his life; he has been physically and sexually abused numerous times. When he returned to my care, we met with his teachers, agreed on an action plan, and got him back into school. We discussed therapy but he was unwilling to engage at that point in time. His life was chaotic, but I was doing all I could to ensure it was as stable as possible. \n\nJust before Christmas, he had another suicide attempt and spent two weeks in the hospital. It was very touch and go; the physical consequences of this attempt are quite severe, and I believe that his judgement is now significantly impaired as a result. \n\nShortly after leaving hospital, we celebrated his eighteenth birthday. Since then, he has decided to cease all communications with me. A mutual friend has told me that he is still attending therapy, and he is returning to school this week. This is good news, but something that concerns me greatly is that my brother has re-opened communications with our father. This man was incredibly abusive during our childhood, and it is my understanding that my brother is living with him at the moment. \n\nGiven his history, this is obviously not a sensible decision. Therefore, I am convinced that my brother is suffering from reduced cognitive function as a result of not only his suicide attempt, but several years of substance abuse, and the ongoing trauma of serious physical and sexual abuse.\n\nNow that he is eighteen, he is free to cease all communication with me and embark on a destructive path if he so chooses. However, I believe he is incapable of making informed decisions in his best interests. I have met with a lawyer who believes that I have a weak case to apply for adult guardianship on the basis that my brother is mentally impaired. This would allow me to influence decisions about his finances, accommodation, and personal care. He would still retain most legal rights, but I would have some legal influence. \n\nI wholeheartedly know that this would go against my brother's wishes. I also know that this would be in his best interests. I know that he surrounds himself with people who have a track record of taking advantage of him, and I know that he is in a very vulnerable state. Less than a month ago, he attempted suicide; how am I expected to accept that he is capable of taking care of himself because an arbitrary date has passed? \n\nI have been the only consistent presence in his life since he was a baby; I have been the only parent he has ever truly known, and I have sacrificed not only my own childhood, but every year of my twenties for this boy. I was the only person who cared if he ate, if he had clean clothes, if he went to bed on time, if he got to school on time, if he got to his appointments, if he had extracurriculars to go to, if he had any quality of life whatsoever. I have turned down a lucrative job offer knowing that I would have to move away from him. I am stuck in a dead end job to remain in the same city as him. I am the only person who has had any communication with his social worker, teachers, or medical professionals involved in his care. I would do anything for him, and his age is irrelevant to that end. \n\nMy only concern is that this application would have a negative impact on our relationship. My brother has ceased communication with me knowing that it is my intention to intervene in his affairs, but I am hoping that in the longterm he would be able to see the benefits of the guardianship. \n\nHow should I approach this with him? Is this something you would pursue if you were in my position? If you would not seek some legal recourse, what would you do instead? Most of my peers are not parents, and those who are, are parents to much younger children without these complex issues. Any input is valued.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "I would only pursue guardianship if you consult multiple lawyers and they all agree that you have a *rock solid* case. Your brother may be pushing you away right now, but there\u2019s still a chance you can mend the relationship. A guardianship application will destroy any hope of rebuilding your relationship with him. This isn\u2019t a problem if your application is approved, but it might be absolutely *catastrophic* if the application is denied. \n\nEither way, I would talk to a lawyer about the best steps to take if your brother is in imminent danger. (In the U.S., it is possible to have someone committed for psychiatric evaluation against their will, but the paths available for doing this vary by state.) Even if you do apply for guardianship, it can be a long process \u2014 you want to have a plan in place to quickly help your brother if he is experiencing an immediate crisis.\n\nI hope everything works out. You\u2019re a good sibling.",

        "title": "Concerns about neglectful behavior with siblings' children",
        "content": "TL;DR - What is a pleasant/loving/constructive way to tell a sibling that their children need more from them if they want them to be healthy adults?\n\nI am going to try to be light on details for the sake of anonymity, so please bear with me. I am the oldest of my siblings and we all came from parents who came from parents who came from parents who had NO idea what they were doing, and to be blunt, didn't seem to really feel like they ever cared to learn a better way to raise their children than the way their predecessors raised them.\n\nNow, when I spend holidays with my family, I see how completely checked out all of the adults seem to be and how little involvement they seem to have with their children. My siblings, my in-law siblings, and their siblings are all pretty lax on what they do with their kids to the point of borderline neglect (if not just outright neglect).\n\nThis can be anything from waiting until their toddler is about to fall over the top of a flight of stairs before they try to interfere, waiting until their child is soaked to the bone before they tell them not to play in the sink (or, heaven forbid, the toilet), listening to their child cry and cry and cry for as much as 10-30+ minutes before they do anything, waiting to change their clothes or pullup because they'll just soil another one soon after they are changed, or just sitting oblivious while their offspring act out in the ways that they normally do to try to get attention at home.\n\nThe mother of my kids left us right before COVID and I've had the \"opportunity\" to learn a lot about what I feel my responsibility is if I want to raise healthy, secure children who can feel safe enough to get help from an adult when they need it, find ways to articulate needs they have that they can or cannot meet on their own, and hopefully never get to a point where they feel like they have to rob a bank to get my attention or feel like I notice them.\n\nMy parents live on the planet of \"I did the best I can. I'm sorry if that wasn't good enough for you.\" While they do express remorse or express a sense of regret, it's only in a nonspecific/general way where they aren't trying to own what they did or take responsibility for anything bad that happened or acknowledge they might have made a mistake they are solely responsible for.\n\nAll of my siblings and I experienced/were exposed to some kind of severe, sexual inappropriateness before we were out of elementary school, up to and including being sexually molested by a family member or family friend, which I feel did not help us find the right tools to develop instincts needed to be drawn to safe or trustworthy people and I feel like we have all paid the price for it, some more than others.\n\nI am terrified that no matter what I do, personally, my own children are inevitably going to experience things that will further traumatize them even more than their mother leaving them already has and that if I am not spending every second trying to be the best parent they could have, then they'll turn out like me.\n\nDespite being in therapy for almost two years now, my youngest will still confide in adults at his school by revealing the fact that his \"real mom\" \"left\" him and effectively reinforce the suspicions of those around him that his self-worth is still in the garbage. He's had, and has, a wide array of problems coping with situations he is still not equipped to process in a healthy way and will still tell adults that he \"doesn't deserve\" because he is \"a bad kid.\"\n\nNow, despite all of this, I feel and believe that my kids feel like I am a safe adult that they can be honest with without having to run the risk of me transforming into Mr. Hyde the way my father did with me if I told him something he did not want to hear. I try to be soft spoken at all times (I think most of the time I only raise my voice at them as few as 2-5x a week now) so that when I do yell, they are not so desensitized to shouting (like I was when I was their age) that it doesn't even reach them. I never hit my kids with my body or an object, or throw things, and try to do my best not allow fear to be my tool of choice to earn their obedience.\n\nWhen my kids spend time with their aunts and uncles (my siblings), my siblings will complain to me about how \"extra\" my kids are. Sometimes they report that they \"tattle\" too often or that they are too picky (e.g. \"I don't like how that tastes, can I please have something else?\"). My kids have learned that when they go over there without me, they have to be creative about how they resolve conflict with their cousins (and each other) because they know they can't bring their concerns to the adults and get their help like they can at home. They also do things like bring their own water bottles so that they can have cold water from home instead of having to drink whatever comes out of the sink.\n\nTheir cousins, however, when they spend time with us, do not know how to communicate their needs clearly, do not know how to ask for help, do not know how to process overwhelming emotions (e.g. \"No, you cannot have that toy because I was playing with it first\" resulting in a complete meltdown), and are disconnected from their body's signals to the point that when they do need to use the restroom and then do have an accident, they do not try to get help from an adult to change into dry clothes.\n\nI don't feel like \"frustrated\" is the right word here because the feelings I have about this are more similar to the feelings I might have if I learned a pedestrian was hit by a car and did not survive. I feel sad and helpless to stop it. \n\nI have spoken to other adults and to the therapist my children see to beg them for guidance on what to do, but it feels like because they are not my kids, all I can do it just try to make sure that when they get older, I can try to be a good example to them of what a safe, consistent person/parent might be. That I can be someone they trust and confide it, who they can come to when they don't know who to go to for help, and that they can feel like they can talk to me about anything without feeling like I am going to make their situation worse (which I feel like my siblings and I will never have, with the exception of clinically trained adults who we give our money to in exchange for guidance).\n\nI feel like I need to find out how I can help make the situations better before my nieces and nephews, and their cousins on the other sides of the family, get to a place where the only thing that might help them are thousands of hours with a mental health expert.",

Let them see it's OK to mess up sometimes. This post really feels like it's more about your struggles than it is about your nieces and nephews. Speak your piece to your siblings but, understand it's their kids.\n\nNone of what you said really sounds like neglect. It just sounds like burnt out parents.",

        "title": "Who did you put down to have custody of your kids in the unlikely event of your death?",
        "content": "Curious to see what everyone has done. We obviously hope this never has to happen. \n\nTLDR; Would you name your parents as guardians even though they're all in their 70s and not mobile or would you name a trusted cousin as guardian and set stuff up as to lessen the burden on her as much as possible?\n\n- My parents: Have space and money. Concerning views & parenting methods. Can pass on culture and language.\n- In-laws: Don't have space. Have money. Liberal views that are more in line with ours. Can't pass on culture and language. \n- Cousin: Will be financially burdened wit an extra kid in the mix. Will run out of space. Aligned views, parenting and can pass on language and culture.\n\nBelow is the long winded version: \n\nWe've yet to write up a will. We have a 2 year old. We're stuck on guardianship of our son. \n\nMy husband just wants to name our parents. But I felt we need to be more specific than that. \n\nFirstly, who has main guardianship or does this need to be split? How will that work? I also worry about their age (all in 70s). I feel that's too much burden at their age so I'm also thinking of maybe asking my cousin who I'm close with and I trust (I do have a brother but he's overseas and unlikely to be able to help and not likely to ever move back). Obviously, I will need to ask her first. \n\nConcerns around each option\n\n- My parents. Given their track record, especially my dad, I worry about emotional abuse as that's what they did to us. Not to mention, chauvinistic, toxic masculinity views and very conservative views around gender and sexuality. Having said that, my mum has been the main person providing care for my son when I work and she's been following everything I say so I feel she'll continue with that. It's just managing my dad which can be a pain. The only saving grace, I reckon, is due to my dad's traditional views, given my son is technically my husband's side of the family, he will most likely restrain himself if my in-laws express any views around his upbringing. \n- My in-laws. They will definitely be able to raise a child with love and respect. More liberal in terms of their views. However, they are unable to pass on my language and my culture which my parents can. Also, MIL was relentless in her views around bilingualism and thinking it'll cause speech delay. On top of that, based on some of the comments she's made in the past, I have a feeling she will not and certainly incapable of passing down my language and culture. I also worry about her being an over anxious, lawnmower parent as she was with BIL who's in his 40s and is still living with them (no jobs). \n\nHealth wise, they're all getting on. My dad is using walking sticks already, my mum needs another hip replacement surgery and even my MIL is saying she is due for one too. They're all getting less mobile. \n\nNow onto my cousin. She's yet to start her own family but planning to and she is not in as strong of a financial situation as we are so the main concern would be burdening her financially with an extra child that's not within her plans. I suppose if we setup a trust, we can counter that. It does mean though she will be burdened by our parents as well as I'm sure they'd still want to be involved (my parents can be a pain in the ass to deal with).  The reason I'm leaning towards my cousin is because I trust her. She and her husband has their head screwed on the right way and their views align with ours and she is just as determined to pass down our culture and language as me. The other problem would be that the house she just bought is obviously with the family she's planning to raise in mind. If we throw my son into the mix (as unlikely as it may be), then I also want to think on what to do there to not screw her up. I suppose if I go with her, I need to think about how the grandparents can still stay involved.\n\nMy parents, on the other hand, have a large house and will have no problem housing my son. They will also have the financial resource to raise him (tbh, both grandparents will have the resource to do so though my in-laws won't have the space since BIL never moved out). \n\nSorry for the long explanation. But yeah. I just don't know what to do. Curious to hear what others have done. I know it's unlikely any of these plans will come into fruition but rather be safe than sorry.\n\nI suppose if you did name a relative, what were the financial mechanisms you've placed in to make sure you're not burdening them too much?",

        "content": "This has been sitting in my notes folder for days. I am reluctant to post is as I am afraid of any criticism on my parenting. But I love my son so much and he is my first born, and this happened so quickly in the world of raising kids. I was a new dad and taken by surprise. He is currently is a juvenile mental health clinic and they just extended his stay to another week, which is probably for the best, but my heart is in pieces for him . Here goes . \nMy son is 13.5 and is going to quite an exclusive charter school. Growing up he was always a very anxious kid: it runs in the family. Up until a few years ago, he and I would go play airsoft together, play warhammer and D&D\u2026.lots of other dad and son stuff. But then he started changing: being moody and distant and me and mum thought he was hitting puberty early and braced for the ride. \nThis went on for a couple of years. The timeline I\u2019m not so sure about so I am going by memory.  He got moodier and moodier and I thought to myself \u201coh boy, he\u2019s going to be one of those Emo kids\u201d. I silently wished he was going to be outgoing and maybe into sport, but he retreated further.\nI\u2019m coming home from work one day and he calls me, voice shaking asking when I would be home. I thought he had broken up with his GF or had been jumped. I told him 10 mins so I rushed home to see him. He told me that he had went into the woods to end his own life with a knife but had thought of his family and couldn\u2019t do it so he called a suicide hotline and they told him to call his parents immediately, which he did. You can imagine my horror: I had no clue what to do or say except for hug him and tell him I love him. I called my wife to come home right away\nThis was a couple on months ago but we learned very soon that he was the victim of a sexual assault by a female friend of his\u2026.I had heard of this happening to people but tbh had brushed it off in the past as not a big deal. How ignorant I was. She had blackmailed him into sending her nude pics of himself and then showed them around the school: I don\u2019t know exactly how she did this. Details come out sporadically and we are in a race to find him the right therapist so he will open up. I personally think the girl, same age as my son, has an abuse history. He was mocked at school (middle school) until he left to go to the school he is in now. \nSince then he has been self harming and smoking weed. Taking aderral and alcohol when he can get his hands on it. We just thought he was going to the mall with his friends and walks in the woods. \nBut to backtrack: it\u2019s all quite a blur and so surreal I get the details mixed up. He was in school one day and had tried to drink hand sanitizer and was witnessed cutting himself. He was immediately brought to the ER where we met him. We sent him to, I guess the common name is a juvenile psych ward, where we could get a diagnosis. My wife is a therapist and knows all the terms. THe physiatrist did say he had trauma and was taking substances to cope. (I\u2019m leaving out details here about his stay at the ward and how he did there). When he came out he seemed fine but then we were finding knives under his bed, vapes in his pocket (we search him when he has been out anywhere). \nThe latest one was he was found with a weed vape and cigarettes on his person so they were confiscated. He got really upset at this and went into the bathroom to \u201cpee\u201d . He went in there and downed a bunch of pills (we lock everything dangerous away) and cut himself again. Luckily he had taken vitamin B. We brought him to the ER again and they, seeing this as a suicide attempt, recommended another stay, which is where he is now. We spoke to (the counselor/phycologist?) and they warned us that if this goes in the direction it is going, he will end up on hard drugs. He has so much pain from his trauma that he will do anything to make it go away. We have a therapist lined up for him as soon as he gets out. So this trauma event(s) has turned into a substance abuse problem and we are in a race against time to fix him before he runs head first into really dangerous territory. Part of me, having grew up surrounded by addicts, thinks this is inevitable and that he will have to go to the depths of hell first before he realizes. Another part of me hopes that with the right medication/therapy and just love from us and his siblings we can save him. I have left the finer details out here. Both his mum and me are regularly waking up in the middle of the night with panic attacks and feelings of dread. \nI\u2019m speaking to people reading this who have been in similar situations and  what they did. I don\u2019t want to miss anything. What else can we do? Put him away for 30 days instead of the 7-10 he has done? Basically, our worst fear is that our son will take his own life and we are absolutely terrified of losing him. Not just that, we want to see him happy and enjoying life . He is a good kid. He is not being nasty to others or us. He is a gentle kid and I think he just feels too much",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "I highly suggest to not push the weed and cigarettes as an issue. The more you push the more he will retreat. yes he's a kid yes it bad but you'd want him to do it around you rather than a bunch of people who will take him down a shittier path. He wants attention. He wants love. Not just from you though which is what makes it hard. He needs to be in an environment that he can make friends with people like him.  Therapy yes. You and your wife need to go to therapy too. You need guidance through this and a bunch of redditors are not going to have the answers. The layers are way deeper than just recent events. Trauma occured and his way of coping is what your seeing and it's not healthy and it's going to leave it's mark. The hospital stay is trauma the attempts of suicide is trauma. All these events are causing more and more psychological wounds and are going to need lots of time and work to heal. you watching him do this is trauma for you. Treat it like a wound. Go get your self into therapy so you can get the tools  you need to guide him. This is my advice as I was your son but my parents didn't even bother with themselves and now that I am a parent looking back they never stood a chance trying to fix a broken kid when they were broken themselves.",

The friend's parents are divorced, and dad has a pool, so the lessons are done in his pool.  Today, after our first joint lesson, the friend asked if we could stay so she and my little one could take a bath together.  I was caught by surprise at the request.  Her dad and his girlfriend didn't say anything indicating disapproval of the idea.  Thankfully, we truly did have company coming over for dinner, and I was able to use that excuse to leave.  On our way out, the little girl said, \"maybe tomorrow?\"  I just said \"maybe\" in a non-committal way and left.  We do go back for another lesson tomorrow, and I won't have another legit excuse.  I need to decline in a way that she won't keep asking.\n\nThing is, I am not at all comfortable with my 6y/o playing naked with her friend.  It's not happening.  I'm just looking for help with carefully wording my denial of the request without hurting the little girl's feelings or embarrassing the dad/girlfriend, but sending the clear message that it's not something that's going to happen.\n\nAlso, I don't know if this matters, but should I mention this to my friend, the little girl's mom?  I am not a snitch my any means, and certainly don't want to be in the middle (or the cause of) any drama between them, but if I were in her shoes, I'd be furious if my ex wouldn't shut down something like this and let my kid play naked with another.\n\nEDIT:  Wow, I didn\u2019t expect to wake up and have this much feedback!  It\u2019s been very interesting reading the varied opinions.  I\u2019d like to provide additional context, since so many don\u2019t seem to understand my position.  In America, sadly, 1 in 4 children is a victim of sexual abuse of some kind.  I am counted in that number.  The European stats are only slightly better, at 1 in 5.  A child is at higher risk when their parents are divorced.  I don\u2019t know the dad very much at all.  No, I am not sexualizing 6-year-olds.  I do believe it was most likely an innocent request.  I\u2019m being cautious because I don\u2019t know what may or may not be considered appropriate by the other child, based on her own experiences.  I think it\u2019s sad that so many dismiss (or even demonize) my concerns, despite the numerous comments from others who said something along the lines of, \u201clisten to your gut, what you\u2019re concerned about happened to me\u201d in the same or similar situation.  I am also a grad student/intern, getting my degree in clinical mental health counseling and marriage & family therapy.  The tales of childhood sexual abuse from my clients are heartbreaking, having impacted their lives for years to follow.  Many originated in such innocent situations as this, and these [now] adults really struggle to grapple with why they weren\u2019t protected at such a young age.  This is why we have a no-sleepover policy in our family.  I just know too much.\n\nI will say that your comments have helped me to see that alerting the other parent is not necessary.

Sometimes during the night, after a bad dream for example, he comes into my bedroom and crawls into my bed. \n\nI spoke with my counselour and did some research on the internet, the general concensus I found is that nudity is not an issue unless either the parent or the child becomes uncomfortable, which has never been the case. Some said that when the time comes, the child will create this privacy boundary himself. Others disagree and say that it is the job of the parent to determine that.\n\nHowever, I also heard from another psychotherpist that this can be detrimental to the sexual health of my child. The argument is that he may be conflating his emerging sexuality with my nude body, and as a result, he may feel feelings of confusion or shame that can cause sexuality issues - such as becoming conflicted or abstemious. I've also heard the argument that if it were a male with a 9 year old daughter, that would not be okay.\n\nClearly there are contradicting opinions. I tend to lean towards the liberal side of things, but want to make sure I am not creating an issue for my child without knowing.\n\nSo far, my boy doesn't seem interested in girls (or boys for that matter), although he is pretty mature for his age - like a 12 year old. He does have some separation anxiety though. My son is perfectly normal and doesn't show any signs of sexual issues or innapropriate behavior.\n\nI do have a partner that I am commited to marry, and he is very uncomfortable knowing about the nudity / sleeping situation between me and my son. \n\nPlease advise. Thank you.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "He's around the corner from puberty. Right at the door at any moment. I think the possibility that this will get really weird quite suddenly is really really likely. He'll be having wet dreams soon, and all of it will be really strange for him and regardless how close you are .. you're still his mom and it'll be uncomfortable. There's a compromise here. Night gowns. You don't need to put under wear under it, you're basically covered and naked at the same time. They can be as thin or thick, as long or as short as you like. Then he can decide for himself about putting on clothes and you've also heard your partner about his discomfort. Win-win.",

        "content": "Since my oldest was 12/13 years old she has been getting into trouble. I caught her smoking weed with a friend, they stole it from the girls grandma. I drove them to the police station hoping for some sort of scare and the knowledge that I'm not playing around that is unacceptable. I wouldn't let my daughter hang out with that girl anymore (she moved shortly after that anyhow). My daughter didn't stop, and she proceeded to be the one influencing all her peers. She had a boyfriend that started doing it. Behavior continued to worsen, she was sneaking out in the middle of the night to meet up with him, they were having sex and she was becoming unrecognizable. They would threaten suicide regularly if the other didn't do what they wanted. \nAfter about a year they broke up, his grandparents and myself were all doing everything we could to end the mess. We installed sensors and alarms on all windows and doors (except my toddlers window). I had her in therapy, she has been on anti depressants, I've taken her to the hospital when she's threatened suicide. She was vaping and even got her little brother to do it too, he was 8/9 years old at the time and said he did it because he didn't want her to run away. \nI called cps and asked them what I can do because she would get in my face and tell me there is nothing I can do, she's going to do whatever she wants to do anyways. Cps basically said she's right. The most that we can do is put her in front of a judge that can make empty threats, but can't do anything past that. I tried enrolling her in big brothers, big sisters, but there was never a match for her in almost 2 years. I tried getting her into sports since even before all this, I've had her try soccer, volleyball, basketball, and track, but she eventually stopped even attempting to play in games and would just walk around so they stopped having her play and she quit doing sports. Her grades have always been poor. We've set rules that grades have to be above an F to see any friends and she barely manages that most of the time. Through out the years, I have not let her have a cell phone (because it always ended poorly, getting caught with nudes, trying to by drugs etc.), to getting her a non smart, flip-phone. She went through periods of not being allowed to have any electronics, of not being able to hang out because she was getting into so much trouble. We have a chore every weekday that the kids are expected to do (it's specific every day so example, Monday dishes, Tuesday sweeping...) and she typically doesn't do it. Every time the freedoms are restricted, we talk about what's ok and what's not, eventually she comes around and says it's not worth all this trouble and she is willing to wait to experiment with drugs until she's an adult (it was all I asked, and I'd caught her with mushrooms, and a note that she was going to be getting acid and ecstasy. She was 14). The start of this school year she got a different boyfriend and she seemed to be turning a corner. She started talking to me more and even telling me she loves me. She told me that he's told her she needs to fix her relationship with me and work harder at school. I was impressed. This boy seemed to be able to get through to her. She made a couple new friends and they quickly became the trio. They were such sweet girls and they have really good, loving homes. I had the biggest feeling of relief, she's finally on a better path and found a better group. \nFor her 16th birthday I planned a surprise party and got her a cell phone on my plan. I reminded her to make smart choices and continue working hard. I continuously reminded her that I'm so proud of her and things were better, as far as I knew. She had so much more freedom and started staying after school to work on school work with her friend. We are close to the school so usually she would just walk home. She even told me that even when she is mad, she is so happy that I care and that I set these rules. She said a girl she knows told her \"at least your mom cares about you, my mom let's me do anything but I don't think she even loves me\". That made me tear up, she hugged me and seemed so.. changed. \nHer and the boyfriend broke up and it became a huge issue. She was trying to get him beat up, he was spreading rumors about her. They were attacking eachother emotionally to the best of their ability. She would come to me for advice and I'd remind to to react in love. They are hurting and trying to hurt the other and it won't end good. To have respect and dignity and cut contact. I was in school and he'd sent me a text that she was telling him she's going to kill herself and don't expect her home. I left my school and went and picked her up from school immediately. She was in a bad place. Said shes been feeling suicidal for weeks now. I took her to the Dr the next day and they increased her meds. I had her in a therapy appt again a cpl days later. I took her out and we went shopping, thinking maybe a couple new outfits could lift her spirit a bit. The boyfriend did attempt suicide that same night and had to be taken to the hospital. His mom informed me that she found a msg from my daughter telling him she hopes to see him dead. \nMy heart stopped. \n\nI had to tell her what happened and she collapsed. I held her and she cried for hours. She told me she never meant that, she was so angry about something he did and she was raging mad. She claimed she learned that her words can't be taken back once said and she's got to be careful. Again I reminded her we show love, always show love. A couple days and she started seeming more upbeat. We chatted a bit and things seemed to be OK. \nOn Wednesday my husband went to make a drink with a leftover bottle of tequila someone bright over on Easter. He noticed that it's mostly water. It froze rapidly. \nI confronted her and she admitted she tried a tiny bit of it because she was curious, got scared and added water to the bottle. \nI said I'm disappointed and she's going to be grounded. I said I need the phone and I asked her to clean the dishes out of her room. She gave me the phone then went to her room. A moment later she came and told me she's running away and doesn't have to deal with this. I'm blown away. What?! \nShe starts freaking out and packing her bag. I'm telling her she'll be reported as a runaway, she doesn't care. She screams at me every vile and hateful thing she can think of. Mocking me and calling me every name in the book. I didn't raise my voice once. Says she has somewhere to go this time and she won't come back. As she's trying to leave, I call my mom and put her on the phone. That took the edge off for a bit. They talked for an hour. I overheard that there's an adult she can go to. \nShe decided to stay home that night and fell asleep, but told me she's still probably going to leave. \nI needed to see what's in this phone. Countless videos and pictures of her getting high inside a really disgusting house and rv, like, torn apart, garbage filled.. nasty. A secret Instagram account where she posts these, along with videos of her drinking, as well as her friends, and the first boyfriend that I mentioned, they got back together, the same time her spirits lifted from the dramatic breakup she just had.\nTimes on photos/videos are showing she is leaving school and then coming back. She did it that same day. I was able to see the location they were taken. (She uses an iPhone, I've been an android person from day one so this is a really hard thing for me to navigate). Then I see her texts with a guy where she's been placing orders and he's going to the dispensery and getting her what she asks for. And many mentions of being in his house or in his rv. \nThere is an adult getting my daughter high. All i know is his first name. \nI go to the police station. The texts and photos aren't enough proof to do anything. They suggest I get his full name and file a restraining order. \nThe location in the photos gets me his address. He lives between us and the high school. Looking up his address, his name shows up. I now have his name. I Google his name. He is almost 40. \nShe had used her school laptop to email a friend, asking her to call him and tell him her mom has her phone now. And that she'll be coming to his house that night. \nI got onto the national sex offender site and typed his name in. I found him. He once raped 2 girls, 5 and 6 years old. We found the court document and it is incredibly horrifying reading in detail what he did to those little girls.. I have been sick since I read it. It had his picture attached to it, I found his Facebook (it was mentioned in an Instagram msg to her friend once) and it is 100% him. \nI called the police over and they are looking into it, he moves all around the country. I'm not sure if he is registering everywhere or if he's on probation still. He's supposed to report for a lifetime. But sex offender lookup in my area doesn't show him.\nShe got home and I had her read what he's done. She went white. She looked horrified and swore that he's never done anything sexually suggestive, that's its only weed and he let's her hang out there. She just thought he understood. I cried and told her how scared I am. She's been going there for months, she's even stayed the night with her friends there. All the time I thought she was doing better, she introduced this lifestyle to her friends. That didn't change her opinions of the things she is doing though. She told me I should be happy she's not using meth or coke because it's offered to her and she sees it done in front of her. She tells me that there's nothing I can do and she's not going to change. Says she just lies to me when she says she will. \nHer messages to friends, she tells them what she's told me and that I'm such a dumb bitch ect. \nI have to tell the parents that their children have been in this man's house. They girls took mom's phones and blocked my number, I had to drive to them to tell them. \nNone of the girls knew, obviously. All us moms are horrified. And I got to learn that changes that have taken place with their daughter since becoming friends with mine. One has an eating disorder and has been in treatment. Her straight A's and close bond with her mom has been fading away. She's been skipping classes too and becoming unrecognizable. The other has attempted suicide multiple times and mom has been reaching out for all the help, only (much like me) is told that she's not in enough of a crisis for much. So she's been in therapy, too. All girls swear that they had no idea and that he's never so much as asked for a picture or made a joke that seemed weird. And they are willing to testify that he has bought them weed.\nMy daughter had a secret phone that this man bought her before I gave her one for her 16th bday. So all along, she had never stopped any of the behavior. Just found other ways to hide it. \nThen I found her msgs to her brother (he's got an old phone on wifi with parental controls, but has Google hangouts).he's 12. She's been giving him weed and telling him there's nothing wrong with it and she'll start giving him joints, he just has to have her make sure he doesn't stink before being around me. \nI reached out to all grandparents. They all refuse to take her in. (\"It wouldn't be helpful, take her to jail and have her locked up for a month, I can't quit my job to watch her, she needs to follow your rules!\" [Work from home job, mind you])\nAll the girls swear he's never so much as asked for a picture, But he's on her snapchat and has saved countless stories she's made, including ones of my 4 year old. \nI have to get her away from the house. I call my best friend who lives almost 200 miles away. She's about to move into a smaller place but hadn't signed on yet. She agrees in a heartbeat to take her in. Get her into treatment there. I called job corps for info and the ones in this state sound wonderful. I've heard from people that went there and people that had family there, glowing reviews all around. I discuss it with her and she says she'll never do it. She knows she has to agree to it. \nI had to pack her stuff yesterday because she refused to. \nIn one of her older msgs to a friend, she told her how I'll never make her leave, I'm too much of a little bitch with no balls to do it. \nNow she is in danger. She has been groomed and read for herself what he did, but still held resentment towards me. \nAnd now she is getting her brother to follow on her path. He's always been a good kid, cares about his grades, and says he wants to go into healthcare like me, he's super helpful around the house, really active and fun to be around. He was under her impression that it's simply a thing that makes you laugh and I'm just being dramatic about it all. I explained to him that I have no problem with weed at all, I think it's actually a great drug and should be used in place of pain pills and for cancer patients and adults that want it. Then I explained how it can hinder the development of the part of his brain that's still not done growing. And if he's starting this now, it's not good for him and he deserves that chance to grow a healthy body first. He cried and hugged me to tight and cried that he just wants me and his sister to be close again. He said she just gets mad that she can't hang out with her friends. I told him how she has had so much freedom and trust the last 6 months, rarely did I tell her she can't have a sleepover or go to a friend's. He realized that was true and her complaints about me during that time were really for nothing. \nI took her to my friend's yesterday. We are going to talk after a week and see how things are going and go from there.  \nShe refused to talk to me the whole way. She's angry. She said I am ruining her mental health, that she's been happy and I'm ruining everything. She's got back into the relationship with the first boy and didn't want to leave him or her friends. \nHer friends are doing distance learning now because they can't be trusted to stay in school, or not get high/drunk at school. \nShe's going to be doing distance learning too. I've got a zoom orientation for job corps set up but she still says she's not going to do it. \nI'm hoping that time away with someone she loves and feels safe with will help, because she certainly refuses me. And even when I've thought she was getting closer to me, it was all fake and all to manipulate me. I can't keep her safe in this neighborhood and now I can't keep my younger children safe if she is around. \nI love her and I'm gutted. I've asked for help from every direction for years. I've taken parenting classes and have assumed it all to be my fault. I'm doing something wrong, I'm not doing enough somehow. We are told it's a phase. We are told she's not critical enough. We are told things seem to be OK (she refuses to open up to professionals past any typical teenage drama she's got). \nI'm just.. I'm lost and I'm broken. I feel sick. I feel scared. I feel like I've failed her and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm afraid for her.",

We are both really excited to become parents, despite it being a surprise. \n\nWe have very different childhood experiences. \n\nHe had a very nice childhood, then his parents got a divorce but managed to keep a working relationship and the children weren\u2019t too negatively affected (I can\u2019t speak to the ins and outs, just what he says) \n\nI had a very complicated childhood and troubled relationship with my mother who is diagnosed BPD with narcissistic tendencies. \n\nI was her first child and the product of a traumatic sexual assault. She was a single parent, moving between houses every 6 months and struggling. She was given the option to abort but she decided against and I was born. As I grew up she used this a something I owed her for \u2018I could\u2019ve aborted you but I didn\u2019t and everything I\u2019ve done and struggled through was for you, so you better be grateful\u2019 type of things.\n\nShe ended up getting into a relationship with a new man, and had 2 children with him. Both were born with disabilities, he was an alcoholic and abusive so I watched him beat my mother and with being so young (5) I couldn\u2019t do anything to help. I disliked him but had no say in it. As I grew older she would rant and vent about him and my brothers to me. I became her only support system. It was difficult to comprehend everything but she needed someone to talk to. \n\nShe was very mentally abusive, only physically abusive when I did something \u2018wrong\u2019 she got very attached to me and would cause arguments when I wanted to get a job and go to college (I was 18-20 at this stage) I still moved out and did these things but to her it was out of spite. She even wanted me to buy a house with her so we\u2019d live together forever and didn\u2019t like when I refused. \n\nHer own mother was a single parent to 4 children and was extremely abusive and her grandmother the same. \n\nWhat books and facilities are available to \u2018break the cycle\u2019? She was a very sick woman and still is to this day and I do feel a lot of her abuse was situation based and lack of mental health resources. She just lived with the struggles and the mother I had was the result of them. I was in therapy for a few months but they advised it\u2019s going to take years of therapy and relearning to get to grips. Honestly I can\u2019t afford years therapy right now so want to know what resources I can buy and research myself to avoid joining the cycle? \n\nApologies this is so long, thank you all in advance for your help! :)",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Have you considered journaling? There\u2019s a million formats. Diaries, sketching, planning and scheduling, or marking baby milestones. \n\nI think it might be helpful for you to have a place to put all these big complicated feelings. And memories. No self help book will make what your mom did ok. But you may also find that it\u2019s hard to convey the deep pain/betrayal that you will feel over the next few years.  Every time you give up something so that your child can thrive/succeed, a little voice will ask why your mom couldn\u2019t do the same for you. Why didn\u2019t she prioritize me? Protect me?\n\nBut if you write down those feelings it can help you work through them. And revisit them when you need to.  We don\u2019t always memorialize all of our good calls as moms, but if you have that safe space that you save them, you can remember on those days you will inevitably question yourself.  It is good to record our wins, and also to vomit out those feelings in a safe space (especially with wild post-pregnancy hormones).\n\nAlso, you could get an app like Libby that works with your local library card and you\u2019ll find tons of free audiobooks on self help that you can listen to while prepping for baby or breastfeeding.",

        "title": "Trauma behavior with teen - driving me up the wall, any advice?",
        "content": "TW: mention of sexual assault\n\nDisclaimers: Teen is 14f, is receiving 1x therapy, 1x social worker intervention with school, all parties communicate regularly. Teen has a darker complexion than her parents suggesting biracial while parents are caucasian.\n\nETA: She has a private, non-school affiliated therapist she sees weekly that specializes in trauma and has been receiving dedicated therapist help for over 2 years. She also sees the school social worker weekly.\n\nBackground: Teen is my step daughter, I have been in her life a little over 3 years. She's asked me to adopt her - I have accepted that I would be willing to if she still feels that way after she's 18. Teen has a trauma filled past with her biological mother. Her mom was diagnosed with falsifying medical conditions (among other mental health diagnoses) 5 years before teen was born, and teen's older 2 half siblings were taken by the state before teen's dad and mom were together (dad did not have any idea of the history mom had). Teen grew up with mom regularly doing role reversal and creating chaotic scenes that made bio mom the victim (including falsely claiming she was r\\*ped at a park that garnered massive first responder response, investigation was able to prove it never happened, bio mom convicted of falsifying a police report). There is a strong possibility that dad is not bio dad, but he is on the birth certificate and he's raised her since birth. He had no idea what was going on at the home while teen was supervised by bio mom during her younger years, and bio mom was later arrested, convicted, and jailed for committing criminal sexual conduct with a different minor child while in the presence of the teen (who was about age 7 at the time). Bio mom coached the teen, at age 7-8, to accuse the CSC victim of molesting her after charges were brought against bio mom. The investigation that handled the molestation piece was deferred to a different county so there was no conflict of interest, and they were able to prove that the teen was coached by bio mom; bio mom eventually admitted to coaching the child. Bio mom is currently on very restricted access to teen right now via courts, and teen claims she wants nothing to do with mom. Bio mom is a known pathological liar and there is plenty of documentation to back this up, and we know she's currently on meds to treat either bipolar or schizophrenia. Teen has asked dad for a dna test, which was originally requested by bio mom via court (and request dismissed), and dad told teen that he understand she wants answers, he is willing to work with her after she's 18 if she still feels that way at that time. The reality is doing a dna test right now will give bio mom more ammunition to harass him in court.\n\nProblem: Teen is in the habit of telling whopper lies, including a very emotional performance with the lies, as a means to get attention. This week's takes the cake - she claimed, while spending a day with grandparents at a museum, that an older gentleman singled her out and told her to \"go back to Mexico.\" She passed the first version of this lie to myself and her father, included a very emotional performance with heavy crying and distress, and demanded answers as to why her complexion is so dark compared to that of her parents and family. I was empathetic and comforted her, but both her dad and I were questioning how the story, based on the details she included, could have possibly happened because her story didn't make sense. We did not share with her that we were doubting her experience, we did comfort her and talk her through it but told her we cannot give her straight answers on her complexion, we just don't know. She passed the second version, slightly tweaked, to her therapist. She passed the final version to her teacher, whom is a POC, and made it so convincing that her teacher requested a private meeting with dad to advocate teen get a dna test so she could have answers. Her teacher had no idea about the complexity of the situation, and was a bit out of line on the meeting with her opinion - that's fine, we're not interested in reporting her, but there are other parents out there that would have gotten this teacher fired for the way she advocated for the teen. The teacher had no idea she was being used as a pawn. We did some investigating for the original story, discussed with grandparents and reviewed the details of the first version that didn't make sense, and were able to figure out that her story most likely didn't happen. We confronted teen yesterday about the truth, and the admitted it was a story she made up, it never happened. Now, there's already an underlying distrust we have with the teen because she's been caught telling so many lies (again, stories making her to be the victim), that we're already conditioned to doubt her truth - which is a terrible place to be, because what if something really did happen to her that was real? She is the boy that cried wolf. We don't want to condition her to not tell us things because she's learned we don't believe her.\n\nI know she is dealing with early childhood trauma and lying is a big part of the trauma response. How do we get this behavior under control? No amount of explaining to her the consequences of her actions has made a difference. No amount of grounding or negative rewards has changed the pattern.  We are communicating all of this with her support team, but there doesn't seem to be a positive change - her lies are getting bigger and bolder.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "She needs more regular and intensive therapy. \n\nI will say, for teen to ask to be adopted sounds like she\u2019s wanting that connection with you.

Fast forward 20 years and some change. My dad and his new girlfriend have a new kid. \n\nI thought the girlfriend was alright. I honestly did. And her and my dad split up and she had my brother and I genuinely thought she was a good mom. I tried to separate my life from my dad\u2019s for the sake of my mental health. He had to relive all the trauma I did. I\u2019ll always regret not stepping in sooner. \n\nI have custody of my brother now. He\u2019s 5 years old. He started kindergarten this year but was expelled for extreme behaviors. Destroying classrooms and property. Profanity. Aggressive and violent. He also had to be repotty trained. There was significant trauma, abuse and neglect. Including sexual. He was home bound for 6 months.\n\nHe started back to school a few months ago. He\u2019s made so much progress. He has had some really good days. But he also still has really bad days. Last week he cussed his teacher and hit her. He hit other kids in the classroom. We had a good run at school but I feel like things have took a total turn the last few weeks and his behaviors are getting really bad again. And I\u2019m having a hard time helping him getting back to having good days.  \n\nHe\u2019s gets super tired every day at 10 am. So we incorporated nap time for\nHim at school. At first he did great with it. He would get cranky, have his nap, and come back in a great mood. Now he screams when it\u2019s time for his nap. But if he doesn\u2019t take his nap, he gets even worse. So we\u2019re all at a loss as to how to help him get the nap he needs, without him screaming and hitting for two hours before the nap. \n\nJust to be clear, without the nap he\u2019d be even worse. We\u2019ve tried letting him go without several times. And I know that the key factor here, is time. \n\nHe goes to bed at 7:45 every night and sleeps through the night. We have a routine. Dinner, bath, brush teeth, story or 2, and then bed. \n\nI just want to help him have good days at school. I know he wants to have them.

At the time, she had a computer in her room and a cell phone, and we kept minimal tabs on her. Initially, we had no reason to suspect she was being unsafe or making really poor choices.   \n\n\nThe two of them escalated the intensity of their conversations, going from banal to intensely sexual...and a one point they traded images. He was enabling her poor choices and encouraging her. At the same time, my daughter was misrepresenting her situation at home to this kid, portraying my wife and I as overly harsh and going so far as to tell him we were verbally abusive.   \n\n\nShe went to extensive lengths to hide her communications with him from us: using multiple devices and apps to interact with him, and deleting her history. She even used in game chat in on her switch. Eventually, things came to a head when we learned about this relationship. My wife and I cracked down on her - taking away her devices and limiting her access and my made it clear that her actions were inappropriate and placed her and our family in potential jeopardy. Her deception and lies to us about this relationship and seeming obsession were huge red flags, and we tried to get her to understand how much this hurt us. A huge, emotional episode later...we thought she had gotten the message and we were moving forward. Only, she didn't. She continued to interact with this boy.  Over the summer, she went so far as to use my cell phone to message him while we were on vacation and deleted the evidence. During the summer, the boy's mother drove him from Illinois (where they live) to Maryland (where we live) and brought him to meet her...all of course, without our knowledge.   \n\n\nWe found about the depths of her deception and fixation in October. At that point, my wife and I spoke the boys parents on the phone and explained what we had learned. His parents thought that we were aware of the kids relationship, but were also unaware of the sexting, and the images. His parents thought that the relationship, as they had seen it, was a positive one. We were shocked and angry about the trip out here, and made it clear that it was in appropriate for an adult to bring their child across multiple states to meet with another child they met online, without the parents consent and approval...and they apologized.\n\nAt this point, we again locked down on my daughter and mandated she cut off contact with him. She also began therapy, and medication for depression. My daughter told us that she wanted to move on from the lying and the fixation and that she wanted to work on herself. My wife and her would have long, emotional conversations about my daughters mental health and emotional state, in which she would again and again say she was happy with her progress. She seemed to gain some perspective and thrive.   \n\n\nAnd now we find out it was all bullshit. 2 days ago, we found out she had been communicating with him since late December, using different apps and strategies to communicate with him. The sexting started again, only more intense and graphic. She had been living two lives, pursuing this obsessive and unhealthy relationship while telling us she was happier without that influence in her life. Maybe both things were true. My wife is crushed - she cant reconcile the systemic lying and deception with the face that our daughter showed us. She is absolutely devastated and doesn't know what to do...she feels as if she has lost her daughter, and doesn't know who she has become. I told my daughter that nothing will stop us from loving her...but the kind of person who is this duplicitous and betrays their family so readily and completely isn't welcome in this family.\n\nI'm out of my depth with this.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "I was in a similar online relationship when I was 14, though we never met in person. I do know this person was the age they said (as opposed to a predatory old man.) And there were similar struggles and deceptions between my parents and me, as well as his parents and him.\n\nThe biggest problem you have is the photos because that's actually illegal. And your daughter needs to know that and understand that.\n\nBut the stricter your restrictions become, the more she's going to feel compelled to go around your back to contact this boy. and if not him, it could be a boy in her class she ends up having sex with. \n\nBoth you and your wife need to stop taking it personally. It's not about you. She may have lied to you but that is what happens when restrictions are too intense, she is going to lie and she frankly is going to do what she wants because she's getting something out of this relationship.\n\nI know this is easier said than done, but in my opinion, it's more productive to set her up for success. Don't put her in a situation where she feels compelled to lie to you. She's likely to have friends in her life you don't approve of and at 15, there's not a whole lot you can do to stop it. \n\nWhat I would suggest is to put it out in the open and let her continue the relationship without the secrecy. You can still monitor her and keep her safe, but it's much easier to do that if she's not feeling like everything needs to be a secret.",

Many of her family lives in poverty because of mental health issues, which I fear she might also suffer from. I recently found out she vapes & smokes pot, is sexually active with multiple different boys and ditches school to smoke. We raised her in a steady home, with two attentive parents- we\u2019ve payed so much to get through school, with prep courses, tutoring, etc... she has Life360 and what we thought was good supervision. She procrastinates and truly does not care about her education- for years, she will do nothing for an entire semester, but somehow always pulls through at the end and get decent grades. I feel so betrayed, and so mad. I took her phone & car for the end of the month. She thinks this is way too strict. I honestly am sick of the lies, and I just want the best for her. Is this too strict of a punishment?",

Suddenly having a huge reaction and taking away major things out of anger doesn\u2019t create consistency for her and just makes the wedge between you bigger.

        "content": "This is a long story, but I\u2019ll try to keep it as brief as possible. Throwaway account as I\u2019m quite active on my main account. \n\nThree years ago, my stepson was pressured by a girl he had a crush on to send her an inappropriate picture. When he did, she freaked out and told her mom. This is how we, his four parents, found out. \n\nSome context - we have a good relationship with my stepson\u2019s other parents. His stepdad and I work in the same industry and share stories over IG message of people we both know. His mom always invites me in when I go to pick him up. She and my husband co-parent together well. We\u2019re very lucky. I\u2019ve known my stepson since he was six. We are very close. In fact, he\u2019s very close to all of his parents, though he often fights with his mom. \n\nHis dad and I are progressive open minded parents. His mom comes from a repressed religious background and comes with her own trauma (not that my husband and I don\u2019t, no judgment here). Because of this, she sometimes decides to parent in certain ways we disagree with. She\u2019s a loving and caring mother but sometimes impatient in ways that might push away a teenager. He loves his mom and is such an emotionally mature kid in that he understands why she is the way she is, but gets impatient with her a lot. They also fight a lot. He\u2019d much rather play video games than clean his room. Typical teenage stuff. She\u2019s doing the best she can, I think, but could probably benefit from working through some of her issues in therapy. But honestly, couldn\u2019t we all?\n\nWhen the last inappropriate picture issue happened, some consequences happened and some boundaries were set in place. We talked to him about how those types of pictures could land in serious trouble legally. He seemed to understand. He\u2019s quite respectful when we talk about consent and boundaries and seems to understand those things completely. This is where the problem may have started though. \n\nHe and his little girlfriend have been together since the beginning of the school year. He has confided in his dad and I that she suffers from some mental health issues stemming from trauma, though he declined to tell us specifics as it was \u201cher story to tell.\u201d We told him that made sense. He said he always lets her initiate their conversations and hangouts to her comfort level. All of this seemed great and we told him that was a good thing to do. We mostly feel lucky that he trusts us to tell us things. We let him ask questions about sex and other things, try to be transparent in our answers. We know sex education is important and try our best to be open and also truthful. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t feel like he can be open with his mom. He feels like she judges him for all of his feelings and questions. She has also long had a lock on his phone where he can\u2019t download apps without permission and the phone shuts off for everything except calling emergency contacts after ten. So recently, she decided for his birthday to finally upgrade him to a new phone. She was attempting to set up new restrictions on the new phone but couldn\u2019t figure it out. She asked him to leave it on the kitchen counter plugged in overnight so she could fix it in the morning. He apparently stayed up all night standing near the kitchen and acting weird. She kept waking up to see him checking on the phone or standing near the kitchen. \n\nOf course, she confronted him about it. When she told us this story, she said she had never looked through his phone without his permission, which I believe. But his behavior sent up red flags for her. She ended up looking through his phone and saw texts to this girl saying, \u201cI need you to delete the pictures I sent you. I already deleted yours.\u201d It seems he was waiting up all night for her to text back. When confronted, he admitted he\u2019d sent inappropriate pictures. \n\nObviously his mom immediately took his phone away. \n\nHe has said she had approached it first and with consent. He said they both had set boundaries. I don\u2019t want to teach him that sexual exploitation is bad but obviously pictures are a huge huge huge legal no-no. In all likelihood, his mother is going to essentially buy him a brick phone for emergencies. We\u2019ve told her we will back her up on boundaries she sets for him. Turns out he has lied to her about several other text related boundaries as well. \n\nHere is where my concern is - I know it\u2019s statistically proven that not allowing children to create their own boundaries and learn how to self-regulate creates bad self-management as an adult. We want him to know his privacy is important, that learning about sex in a healthy way is good, and to teach him about honesty. We also can see that our lesson from last time didn\u2019t work but don\u2019t want him to withdraw from us as parents. The phone choice is up to his mom as she is the one who pays for it. We disagree with her on a lot of things but honestly can\u2019t disagree with his. \n\nShe and him have mutually decided that he should start going to therapy, alone. This was actually apparently a conversation that started before this incident because he confided that he thinks he may be suffering from depression. That would make sense as his dad also has depression. \n\nI guess long story short - how should we approach this? What are the next steps? Are we handling things appropriately? I plan to allow my husband to navigate this conversation with him and to have him tell our son that while I know what happened, I\u2019m not going to talk to hook another it unless he wants to talk. His dad is such an emotionally mature person that I know he\u2019ll handle this a well as he can. We just want to help our kids become a strong, sensible, kind, healthy and emotionally developed kid. We think he\u2019s on the right track, but we may just need to help him along in certain ways.",

        "title": "My (M35) Partner (F34) has Postpartum Depression but refuses any help",
        "content": "Background: Me and my partner have been together for 10 years, last year in August we had our first child, our daughter who we love.\nThe first month, was great, I was off work for 4 weeks as I had 2 weeks of statutory paternity leave plus 2 weeks on holiday I took which my employers were kind enough to let me take. We made a good team and we found the newborn stage actually quite easy (I know we got very lucky with a sleepy and chilled out little girl).\nThe issues started when I had to go back to work. I work 9-5 Monday to Friday as the main breadwinner my partner is home alone with the baby and has been for the past 15 months.\nWe moved to the area we live now which is rural because she liked the peace and quiet and scenery, it was a bigger house for a family and it was a few minutes\u2019 walk from a nursery and school. However she doesn\u2019t drive so is reliant on me to get to places as public transport isn\u2019t great here.\n \nI have made posts about the difficulties my partner and I have been having and many of the helpful comments bring up PPD.\n \nShe has had depression previously related to work stress, she had therapy and had medication at the time and she had made a recovery. Unfortunately in the UK if you have had mental health issues this is logged on your record which caused issues further down the line.\n \nPart of the reason we left where we lived before we moved to the rural area, was that my partner was being stalked, and when she reported this to the police they downplayed it all and said they could see that she had previously had mental health issues and was she sure she wasn\u2019t misinterpreting things she was seeing and experiencing.\n \nWhen we had our daughter it was in the thick of Covid, so my partner had to be at the hospital by herself the whole time, I was only allowed to be there during the actual birth and in the recovery room afterwards.\nThe whole experience was traumatic for this reason, for a couple of reasons, she was having an elective C-section and had to wait 7 hours on her own, then in the actual C section she started to regain feeling as they were stitching her back up and then the aftercare at the hospital was terrible and the midwives treated the new mothers on the ward quite badly, I\u2019m sure because visitors were not allowed, they could get away with a lot. My partner had to stay in hospital for 2 nights and during the time she heard the midwives talking badly about her and some of the other new mums on the ward and when she confronted them, they gaslit her and said is she sure she wasn\u2019t hearing things, and continued to be quite nasty to her. She was smart enough to ask them to call me to explain their concerns about her mental health, which when she said that none of them wanted to call me to explain their concerns to me.\n \nSince the start of 2021, my partner has been struggling more and more with being a stay at home mum, she is bored and struggling to cope. She is angry 75% of the time.\nI know how hard it is to look after a baby/toddler all day every day, but the issue we are having is that she has been getting very angry lately, saying I don\u2019t do anything to help or support her, she feels she is doing it all on her own and she might as well be living on her own. I am frustrated because in my point of view, I pull my weight and do my fair share and to be accused of doing nothing doesn\u2019t feel great, especially when I am up and doing household and childcare duties from when I get up to when I go to bed with no time to do anything I enjoy and not much time or involvement to do anything as a couple.\n \nShe has said she is bored being stuck in all day with our daughter and gets pissed off if we don\u2019t go out and do something every day, she says things like she regrets our relationship, I am boring, I have no personality. When she is bringing up these issues, sometimes I won\u2019t really respond as no matter what I say it\u2019s not the right answer, if I point out what I do its dismissed, if I ask what else can I do for her to take the pressure off her, she says I should know that.\n \nI am no saint, I am emotionally overwhelmed so I shut down or I get defensive sometimes, it gets too much and I say things like whatever, yeah yeah, im such a  terrible person, I know I am dismissing her and I am working on staying calm and not getting defensive like that.\n \nFor my part, I look after our daughter from 6am when she gets up, I feed her, play with her, get her ready brush her teeth, put away the laundry get myself ready for work then go to work (hour drive) when I get home I take over again feeding her dinner, playing with her, giving her a bath, putting her to bed. Then once she\u2019s in bed I clean up the kitchen and put the laundry to wash. I hoover at the weekend or if its particularly messy in the week. The only job I don\u2019t do is clean the bathrooms which my partner does every couple of weeks (not because I won\u2019t if she needed me to I would do it as well, I just have so much on my plate I don\u2019t always remember to do everything unless it is particularly dirty). At the weekend I am solely responsible for caring for our daughter.\n \nIt is affecting me as well. I enjoy watching football (soccer) but I can\u2019t really watch my teams games, or I will be accused of not doing anything with her, so I don\u2019t bother any more, the same with video games, I used to enjoy them, but rarely play for more than a couple of hours a week or two. If I am downstairs doing something, whether it be cleaning/playing with my daughter or whatever, my partner will accuse me of playing video games and accuse me of lying when I say I am doing something else and that I am addicted to them and can\u2019t tear myself away from them, I only play them if I have done everything else I needed to do and she\u2019s out at an appointment or out with a friend and our daughter is having a nap or is at my parents, if I want to play them normally it causes her to get angry at me.\n \nI used to go to the gym a lot pre covid and pre baby, and was in a lot better shape, but I feel like I haven\u2019t got the time to take a couple of hours away from the house a couple times a week to go to the gym, she is already talking about not feeling supported and not feeling like she\u2019s getting enough help and about being bored, so I can\u2019t afford to take time away from the house. what I am trying to say is I have no scope for having hobbies and interests and its getting me down, my only downtime is my drive to and from work where I listen to podcasts.\n \nAnother issue we have had is in the bedroom, we have only had sexual intimacy 4 times in the whole of this year, it is something  I had brought up as an issue, but now she says I am always talking about sex and being too sexual with her, I am more attracted to her than ever and I tell her this regularly and try and flirt and be playful, I do try and initiate regularly but it does get me down that she doesn\u2019t want me in that way (not since the back end of last year after our daughter was born). Its important to me and it does bother me, but I realise that this issue is secondary to the issues in the relationship, I fully understand that this aspect is not the priority and her wellbeing  needs to be looked after first and foremost before we can tackle this issue. I just can\u2019t help how I feel, I feel unloved and as she shows me no physical affection or intimacy on top of not actually being nice to me most of the time, but I realise I need to push this down and try to ignore my feelings on this.\n \nI really feel that I can no longer discuss anything with her honestly and openly, she no longer respects me or appreciates me and she doesn\u2019t have any love or patience in her heart for me. any time I talk about things bothering me if it puts any responsibility on to her, she is angry and accuses me of having a dig at her, I already use the \u201cI\u201d statements instead of \u201cyou\u201d but this doesn\u2019t work. She only seems to have contempt and criticism for me.\n \nMore importantly, as our daughter is getting older, she is getting bored being stuck in all day and testing her boundaries and I am worried that my partner is especially not coping with this change as she is starting to resent our daughter and she doesn\u2019t seem like she wants to interact with her and play with her and teach her things, I feel I can\u2019t ask what shes done with our daughter today without her thinking im accusing her of neglecting her and her getting angry at me. my partner is bored, our daughter is probably bored but she does not want to take our daughter out even for a walk, as its \u201cnot scenic enough\u201d which also makes me think of depression.\n \nI have suggested to her that she might have some kind of PPD, I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s anything wrong with her but she might just need a bit of help by talking to someone or she might just need a little bit of medication to help her feel a bit more herself. She has dismissed this completely, she accuses me of calling her crazy and she says she doesn\u2019t want it to go on her record so it can be used against her next time she has to call the police or go into hospital, like I have mentioned at the top.\nShe knows she is depressed and angry but she thinks she is justified in being angry but still refuses to get any help with it.\n \nWhat can I do to get her the help and support she needs without pushing her away? How can I have the kind of difficult conversations that are needed in relationships, without her getting angry and dismissive of me? How can I be more supportive and helpful to take the pressure off her? She is clearly hurting and I get that she is not communicating that in the nicest and most productive way but maybe I\u2019m an asshole and I haven\u2019t been listening for the past year and she has run out of patience.\nI know she is hurting, but how can I stop her hurting me without making her feel like I\u2019m having a go at her? She has said she regrets ever meeting me and question the relationship often, if I stand up to her by setting boundaries about how I\u2019m treated, if I try to enforce those boundaries, I can see her following through with leaving and trying to take our daughter (I fear this the most as she isn\u2019t coping now with my help so I dread to think what will happen if she tries to do it alone \u2013 her only family is her mother who isn\u2019t a reliable support system for her and she doesn\u2019t have many friends she can rely on).\n \nThank you for reading it all if you got that far and for any suggestions or support.\n \nTLDR: My partner is a SAHM and is bored and is angry most of the time with me and not coping with looking after our daughter, she says I don\u2019t support her or help around the house but I know I do a lot around the house and with our daughter when I am not working. The anger is so bad and causes her to criticise and insult me and the relationship and she seems to resent our daughter.\n \nI have suggested she talk to someone for how she is feeling but she refuses any help due to issues with mental health issues being used against her by hospital staff and police in the past.\n \nHow can I support her and help her get through this, how can I stop her from lashing out at me with her anger without pushing her away and causing her to follow through with leaving as she would leave to spite me or call my bluff if I try to enforce a boundary.",

Her health is deteriorating but she is holding up with chemotherapy and lots of love from our son who is enamored with her and takes great care of her needs and comfort.He does get sad from time to time because he can see her slowly wilting yet he tries his best to support he in her final moments and we couldn\u00b4t be more proud. Things have been going better in his educational environment as well since we got to come to terms with the school district and we received a public apology on behalf of the staff concerning the unfortunate incident with his clothes,. Things have been smooth sailing for a while when it comes to our family life despite of the occasional ups and down.\n\nHowever this time around a rather pressing issue has sprung that has caused Max (Our son) great confusion. May I remind that me and my husband are a homosexual couple and our son is a self proclaimed homosexual 14 , soon to be 15, years old  since the age of 9, way  before we adopted him through the foster care system. Due to his tough upbringing he has been under watch for the past years and is monitored by mental health professionals along our side.\n\n So the past few days he had been acting stand offish and rather avoidant with us , we could  tell something had happened to him but he refused to talk. My husband and I got very worried, we thought he could have dealt with a traumatic experience while we were missing or we were at work and I hate to admit but it got us in a bit of a paranoid state. His therapist suggested we wait until Maxy was ready to talk on his own and thankfully he did talk to us yesterday. He came to me very reluctantly and he expressed his fear of abandonement asking me whether we would abandon him if he did something bad. I reassured him that there was no way we would ever do that, he requested to be held and he started to describe an incident shivering and crying.\n\n Turns out he had experienced a sexual moment with one of his teammates while they were play fighting during  judo practice. I asked him whether he felt forced or if that person tried to do something to him he didn\u00b4t want to at the moment or at all but he burst into tears and admitted he did want it and liked it and he knows that it\u00b4s bad he felt that way. I explained to him that there is nothing wrong with liking it and that it\u00b4s normal at his age to start having sexual interest towards other people.  May I add he was often cursed at and sometimes beaten in the past for demonstrating sexual behaviours as a child especially towards boys so in many ways he has connected that behaviour with something forbidden and wrong. I reassured him plenty that we won\u00b4t put him back in the foster care system and suggested he talks about it with his therapist which he refused. \n\nWe consulted our own but we didn\u00b4t get any pointers as to how to handle the situation except wait it out until Max is ready to address it again. My husband is worried about his well being and he wants to know more about that boy from practice, they weren\u00b4t really friends, but that kid is also a preteen and we wouldn\u00b4t want to out him to his parents ( whether experimenting or indentifying as homosexual, bisexual etc) since we don\u00b4t know their opinions on such matters and it may cause trouble to the child\u00b4s life.\n\nSo now we are facing a difficult task , we do our best to reassure our son and we have talked countless of times about healthy bounderies in order to prepare him for a future healthy sex life but it seems like it hasn\u00b4t been enough. We had the safe sex talk in case things went further but we are worried, considering his reaction, how this is going to develop and not knowing the boy he is interested in all that well we feel very on edge about his safety. I would like some advice from fellow parents on how to handle the subject of sexuality in this tricky situation because just waiting and observing from the side lines considering the trauma Maxy has been through seems absurd. Where is the silver line between being a protective parent and mendling with their personal affairs? Puberty is hard to handle...",

        "content": "My experience is from the 'mother of daughters' perspective but this is relevant to any kid. Everyone needs to know about sexual health. We have gotten somewhat better about discussing the menstrual cycle but that is almost completely focused on menstruating. Very few kids are taught about ovulation which, I would argue, is considerably more important. Once a month, your \"menstruation cycle having\" kid very well might feel indescribably, unrelentingly horny for a few days. Seriously, it is hard to describe to someone who doesn't menstruate. During ovulation, if you don't know what is happening to your body, you can make life altering stupid decisions. \n\nTalk to your kids about ovulation. Teach them to use apps (or a written calendar if you don't like technology) to track their cycles every month so that they know not only when they are going to menstruate but also when they are ovulating. My two have been saved from some poor choices by looking at their app and saying, \"oh, I'm ovulating. I'm going to wait a few days and if I still want to do this then I'll consider it\".\n\nEdit: also important to note that ovulation can be an amazingly good time but they have to be smart about it.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Side note: teach your kids about irregular periods and that ovulation is not an exact count. Apps and calendars cannot accurately tell you when you're ovulating. AFAIK the only accurate way are ovulation tests, though temping and other ways have been shown to be fairly reliable as well.\n\nEdit: also teach them about how sperm can survive for several days (I think 5-7 maybe?).

I mean like so she grows up feeling good about her herself and not repressed\n\nOkay, so this is a throwaway, as I don't know how this will be received here, and also family know my main account, so there's that too lol.\n\nMy daughter is only 5, and has just started school. In my eyes, I want to start helping her grow up feeling good about herself, and importantly set out boundaries and a sense of self around sexuality, consent, and positivity around sex as she grows up. I have already overheard kids that are only a couple of years older talking about sex and boys/girls when I've taken her to the park\n\nOur daughter is an only child in a loving family with both parents. Normally (I might be wrong here, but all online advice is for mums), this is taken up by mum; however, my wife always uses cutesy words for body parts, confusing euphemisms etc. \n\nNothing I say to her sticks, as it reverts back as soon as she speak to mum I know she's only 5, but I think these are the building blocks to avoid bad stuff happening in teen years. I'm worried that she isn't going grow up with a positive understanding of her body and sexuality because my wife is so apethetic to the subject.\n\nMy wife's no prude, so I don't really get it. I know she had an awful childhood, an outrageously uneducated promiscuous period as teenager (ended up in dangerous abusive situations) and suffers life long mental health problems as a result.\n\nI am no prude either. I believe that teenagers should experiment, have fun, and enjoy the prime of their lives doing stupid stuff, relatively safely - if that makes any sense at all. I don't think it's a complete oxymoron. I just want to make sure when my daughter gets to that age she had a good grounding on the subject, can think for herself, and stay safe while experiencing whatever she wants to from a place of positivity and empowerment.\n\nHow the hell do I do that a) as a father with no real world experience of being a woman,  b) without it being wierd or creepy c) without my wife just reverting to \"front bumkin\" the next day.\n\nOr am I overthinking this? Am I being a total dickhead? I just want to do the right thing. This parenting thing is tough lol",

As a typical insecure teenager, I remember comparing my body to theirs and feeling like garbage.

She is also sweet and kind and funny. She has unfortunately had to deal with some bullying in her short life and it has made her insecure, and on top of that the pandemic took a toll on her mental health and she now has social anxiety as well. She has always had \u201ccrushes\u201d on boys since kindergarten. The first day of school comes and after she gets home we have a conversation. It goes like this:\n\nDaughter: \u201cA boy at school told me he likes me.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cDo you like him back?\u201d\n\nDaughter: \u201cIdk, I don\u2019t know him very well\u201d\n\nMe: *silently cheers in parent for her mature response* \u201cwell what did you say?\u201d \n\nDaughter: \u201cI got quiet for a second and then just said, Okay, and went back to my work\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cThats okay honey, it\u2019s good for you to take time before you decide if you like some one. Sometimes someone may like you and you may not like them back. Just remember to be kind, but set boundaries for yourself.\u201d\n\nDaughter: \u201cI don\u2019t think I like boys anymore, I think I like girls. What if I\u2019m gay? I think dad will be mad at me if I\u2019m gay and other people will judge me and make fun of me.\u201d\n\nPause in the story to add that I\u2019m divorced from dad, bisexual, and identify as Poly (although currently monogamous with her step-dad). \n\nMe: \u201cYou might like girls, or guys, or both or maybe even neither. Your only 8 and have plenty of time to work that out, but even if you do like girls, that\u2019s okay. Your dad will understand and I\u2019ll be here to support you no matter what. If people are going to judge you for something so silly, those aren\u2019t people we want to be friends with anyways.\u201d\n\nThere are two thing for me as a parent, the first is wondering if anyone else\u2019s kids are questioning their sexuality this young? I knew I was Bi when I was 12 but 8 seems crazy young to me. \n\nThe second is she told me the next day she had a conversation with some boys in her class and told them she decided she doesn\u2019t like boys and only likes girls. I know she has plenty of time to decide and I meant what I said. I also know that people are idiots and young children can be especially mean. I don\u2019t want to discourage her in anyway or make her feel like she should hide anything, but I\u2019m also concerned that by telling people she is going to open herself up to bullying. I also feel like she may not actually know her sexuality this young and that maybe she should only talk about it with people she trusts for now until she has time to decide for sure. \n\nI feel like this is an important topic and I don\u2019t want to mess her up mentally or make her feel unsupported in anyway, but I also want to protect her. She seems to be very nervous about it and has brought it up at least once everyday.",

However I have other bi friends who knew from the get go. So it\u2019s not unheard of.\n\nMy son recently asked me if he *has* to marry a lady, I said no you can marry a man if you want to or no one at all, it\u2019s up to you. And we had a discussion about how some people like the opposite gender, some the same gender and some like all genders. He accepted that and was fine about it. We also have books that include same sex couples and have watched movies like Out, that is specifically about a man telling his parents that he has a boyfriend. Not just because my son asked, it\u2019s just something we\u2019ve always done because I\u2019ve always wanted my kids to feel comfortable if they are LGBT, I would hate them to feel ashamed or that they have to hide it.

Our 14 yo daughter is super depressed and diagnosed with BPD.  We've been working with therapists and psychologists for about a year now.  One of the greatest advantages I feel we have is my daughter is super transparent with me (most of the times) and comes to me when she does something wrong, harmful, or otherwise.  I know a lot of parents would probably kill for that...  \n\nI've never punished her for anything she disclosed to me.   I feel if she brings it to me, all is fair.  We had issues with her in the past misappropriately using Discord (online relationships / sexual relationships)  and grounded her from her phone for about 5 months due to it. We gave her a flip phone she could still text and call on.  It was actually a beautiful 5 months, no drama from social media or issues with friends.   She did well with it.  \n\nIn a bout of trust, I allowed her to get Discord back about 2 months ago because she said she was involved with a lot of mental health groups (which I still trust to be true). \n\nToday, her mom was snooping on her phone and found she's been carrying on an online relationship again.  I gave her the chance to fess up 3 times and she lied to me every time.  Now I have no clue what to do.

You are right to be disappointed and she is hiding it because she needs her own thing right now. \n\nI would be like you and be confused at how to proceed. \n\nI say if she is still in front of you, you dont need to worry. \nWhen you find a good moment, be crystal clear to her about whats bothering you and what she thinks you should do in your position?

        "title": "Our Son wore a Gay Rights shirt to School and it wasn\u00b4t perceived well.",
        "content": "For context , my husband and I are a married gay couple in our mid 40s and our son has recently turned 14. We did adopt him from foster care after a couple of years of fostering him while he was younger during which he has been always identifying as a homosexual . According to other care takers he previously had , as young as 8 years old he has been stating that he is romantically interested in other boys.\n\nWe had to fight a custody battle with the court which left us wounded and exhausted until we managed to adopt him due to the fact that there was a problem with his biological parents and some specific mental health professionals that questioned our eligibility to parent a child that identifies as a homosexual given that we are also a homosexual couple and that could affect the child\u00b4s sexual and emotional development.\n\nIt has been a long difficult journey for all of us that left us scarred yet we managed to make it through and we have been a strong happy family ever since. Since then my husband is especially loving and protective of our son and to this day he won\u00b4t have anyone talking bad our mistreating our child.He s been teaching him how to stand up for himself, how to accept himself no matter what anyone says and reassures him that we both accept him and love him as he is. They have a very beautiful connection, he d take him for outdoorsy activities like paintball and rock climbing, they play video games and he gets him all the fashionable cool clothes he wants. It\u00b4s fair to say our son is spoiled with love and affection , he is free to choose what he wants to wear, what activities he wants to participate in and we trust that he makes good choices.\n\nSo the other day, given it was pride month, they returned home with a brand new rainbow t shirt with Gay rights written all over it in huge neon letters. Maxy (our son) seemed very excited and he ran up to me to show me his \u00b4\u00b4 cool new shirt\u00b4\u00b4. I asked him whether he knew what it was about to which he replied that of course he knew since he is not a baby and he asked to wear it to school the next day.\n\nPersonally I was skceptical, I was afraid this would put him in a vulnerable position given that he is a preteen and children at that age tend to be rather cruel with comments and mockery. We haven\u00b4t had the need to discuss Maxy s sexuality with the school or the teachers up to now since it\u00b4s something personal and knowing how we have been treated by the education system ( nothing major just side eyed and looked at as strange speciments at parent -teacher meetings since we are the only homosexual couple there) I didn\u00b4t expect them to take it necessarily on a good note or knowing how to handle it.\n\nMy husband supported his choice saying that if he feels comfortable wearing it then that is all that matters. I insisted we have a talk about discrimination with Maxy which he had already faced in the past and sort out his feelings on the matter. Personally I adviced him that he didn\u00b4t need to share more than he felt comfortable sharing with people , after all this shirt promoted gay rights so if he wanted to start a conversation with his classmates he didn\u00b4t need to out himself , he could simply talk as an ally , or a child having gay parents. ( Though now I m not so sure that was the right move, maybe I put too much of a negative light on the subject and I should have handled it better.)\n\nMaxy seemed very cut throat , he said he was not embarassed and that he was very certain about who he was, something that surprised me considering his age. Even though he has been talking about his interest in boys for years I did not expect him to have such a clear image of his identity that young. It\u00b4s important to note that he chose the shirt himself, it was custom made and he really liked the design, he mentioned he was really proud of his queer family and he wanted to show off his cool clothes.\n\nThe next day we got a phonecall from the principal calling us in. Maxy had been sent home for violating dress code and they wanted to talk to us about his inappropriate get out. In short we were told that Maxy was going around school \u00b4\u00b4having fights\u00b4\u00b4 with children about gay rights and flaunting his get out. Probing a bit I found out that he had just gotten in an argument with a classmate and they just had a disagreement, they didn\u00b4t throw hands or antyhing.\n\nAfterwards the teacher that reported his behaviour flat out accused us of \u00b4\u00b4pushing our agenda\u00b4\u00b4 on Max and dressing him up as a moving billboard and dooming his future. I was dumbfounded , this whole event triggered the court battle trauma and I felt so overwhelmed. My husband was simply furious at her for speaking like that about our family and putting our son on the spot just for wearing a rainbow shirt he liked. They went as far as to threaten us with social services saying this was a case worthy of being \u00b4\u00b4examined\u00b4\u00b4. I m personally at a loss, I don\u00b4t know what the school will do or whether they will accuse us of exploiting our child but after all Maxy has been through this is such a cruel and unfair treatment for him.\n\nI m upset and really worried about our child s well being. I do not understand why our family is being targeted like that, I can\u00b4t stand seeing my husband and our child suffering, I really want to be able to handle this situation the best way possible involving Maxy the least possible to protect him. I would like some advice on how to address this situation, I did explain how and why it happened but they seemed rather keen on having an expert \u00b4\u00b4be the judge\u00b4\u00b4.\n\nOur son is already under watch by specialists due to his difficult past so they shouldn\u00b4t have any right to bring anyone else to our door. I just don\u00b4t want him to go through this hell again, and I m worried about my husband as well, he might not show it but he is a deeply sensitive man and I know how much being accused of bad parenting and exploitation is hurting him, he is also afraid we might lose Max and so am I with the threats we receive with situations like this.\n\nI just want our family to have a chance to be happy, I don\u00b4t expect us to do everything perfectly but I think Max has a right to be himself as he sees fit. How do I help my son understand that he has done no harm by being who he is , how can I be sure we are not unintentionally pushing anything on him? This whole situation has got me doubting myself as well, I love our son and I love my husband more than life, I just want to find a way to make them feel loved , secure and deal with the problems without stressing them out.\n\nTLDR The school our gay son goes to accused us of pushing our agenda on our child because of a specific gay rights shirt he wore at school. I want to handle the situation with the principal witout stressing our child or my husband since they have been through a lot.",

When I say a lot, I mean this girl lived with us during quarantine for 4 months, spends every weekend with us, and probably 2 nights a week. I have become very close with her and consider her part of the family.\n\nShe has had a pretty traumatic life in her short 14 years, and her home life is not great. In the 18 months I have known her,  she has grown to trust me and confided in me quite a bit. She told me recently that her older brother, age 18, has been violently raping her for several years now. It happens several times a week, and that is part of why she tries to stay away from her house as much as she can. \n\nI struggled with myself for a bit because I didn't want her to feel I had betrayed her confidence, but knew I had to report it and get her out of there. I made the call yesterday. Her mom hasn't asked her any questions, immediately believed the brother and claims she is lying to get attention and start drama. \n\nNow she is out of the house but very upset with both me and my daughter.

        "content": "I've had legal custody of my sixteen year old brother for a little under a year now. I've been responsible for him unofficially since he was a newborn, so this is not a new arrangement; it just happens to be the first period in our lives where the agreement has been on paper. In all but name, I am his parent. But I've never felt more at my wit's end raising him than I do right now.\n\nMy brother was sexually exploited as a small child and it recently emerged that he has been abused repeatedly as an adolescent as well. This happened when he was in my care. I'm a failure as a parent and I know it, but I will do anything to pull this back and make it right. I cannot understand how I missed this, or how I could have failed him to this extent. I made efforts to search his devices wherever possible and took steps to discern where he has been going, and who he has been going out with, but it wasn't enough and I haven't been able to protect him. It has come as a shock; I thought we both were coping despite previous setbacks and our current arrangement was working for both of us.\n\nHe has grappled with depression and did have a slight relapse before Christmas; I believed substance abuse was to blame at the time. Aside from this, I presumed we were coping very well. We've been working alongside his social worker, he is in therapy, and generally, he has appeared more comfortable in himself. He has been managing his temper considerably well. He appeared to be dealing with the abuse coming to light with resilience. He cooperated with the police in giving an account of the abuse, and readily surrendered his devices. He has been attending therapy without arguments. He has been communicating with me when he felt overwhelmed.\n\nHowever, since returning to school almost two weeks ago, we've fought daily. He was attending online classes due to the pandemic, and he just returned to face-to-face learning. He performs adequately at school when he applies himself, but homework is a consistent battle. He insists that he'll finish it later, but later never comes. His workload got on top of him during online schooling and he has more to catch up on than he thought; yet he prioritises going out with friends, gaming, texting, or getting high. I have done everything in my power to counter this but it really is beyond my control at this stage, and considering the bigger picture, it seems petty that homework is the catalyst for our major disputes lately.\n\nAs I type, he is spending the night at a friend's house having stormed out, again. I don't know which friend. I don't know where. I don't know what he is doing. He refuses to answer the phone or respond to texts. I called his social worker at 11; this is the agreed upon procedure when he violates curfew. Every time he fails to return home, they tell me they'll check back in the morning, and suggest I call the police if I can't make contact.\n\nBut then what? He's sixteen and almost my size now. I can't restrain him. I can't force him to stay in the house. I can't force him to do anything, and I don't want to force him, I want to communicate with him. I can search his room, I can confiscate drugs, I can search his devices, I can switch off the WiFi when it's time to work or sleep. But it all infuriates him and he'll leave the house in a rage. Then I'll sit up all night sick to my stomach until I know he's alright. If I call the police, I know he might get confrontational with them and risk arrest. It wouldn't be the first time he's gotten into trouble.\n\nHe was sneaking out of our Father's house at night when he was twelve years old, and I've done all I can to combat it over the years. It was easy when he was small enough that I could put my arms around him and talk until he calmed down, but that really isn't an option anymore.\n\nI can't spend another night sitting up in fear that I'll get a phone call saying something has happened to him. I've been sick with stress and I'm starting to feel constantly unwell. My heartbeat is consistently irregular and I'm not even in my thirties. I love my brother more than life itself. I adore him. But I can't keep this up. I'm not enough for him, and I feel his issues are beyond my capabilities. I am terrified something will happen to him and I'll not be able to live with myself if it does.\n\nThere are more concerns - I'm troubled about the material he consumes on the internet, for one. And both of our parents are attempting to re-establish contact with him. Both were abusive and the reason he is in my care. Our Father will likely be taking us to court for custody again soon. But these are problems I can't begin to tackle tonight. I'm overwhelmed - there are too many obstacles with this boy. I have two years left in which time I can legally do something to help him, but that time is running out fast. I love him deeply, but I feel out of my depth. He is completely off the rails, and I have no idea what to do. I've been parenting him since I was a child myself and I need help. Last time he was in foster care he felt rejected and our relationship was strained for months, but I feel I can't cope much longer, particularly if we keep taking these steps backwards in progress.\n\nWhat can I do? How can I help him? How can I establish normal boundaries when he has endured pain that is so beyond normal? He's a good kid when he isn't aggressive - he is thoughtful, kind, funny, intelligent, and deeply sensitive. I love him more than I've loved anyone or anything else in this life, but I can't continue like this.\n\nUpdate as of Monday evening; he came home late on Sunday and seemed in a darker mood. We had a conversation about school that didn't go positively, and he went to bed. When I woke up, he had already left the house. He'd text me saying he was going to school early, but I had a gut feeling he was lying. I got in the car and drove around to find him. He wasn't far away and agreed to get in the car.\n\nHe's been struggling more than I thought with his circumstances; one of his friends has been bullying him for a few months. He hasn't told many people about his circumstances, but this friend has been quite unkind about his situation, and particularly his lack of a relationship with our Father. He has quite a low opinion of himself at the moment and seems to have internalised a lot of the unkind things that were said. We've got an appointment with his therapist this week, and I've called his social worker to see if we can get him some more support with his mental health.\n\nI'm just glad he's talking to me, and I hope without this so-called friend in his life, he'll start to feel a little happier. He has a good group of boys who come around often, and they're great kids we've known for a while. I'm hoping he'll start to focus on these friends and get less caught up in the opinions of one nasty little bully. It can be easy to forget that teenage boys are hiding a lot of sensitivity behind the bravado. I'm glad he's learning to express how he's really feeling.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Honestly, show him this post. Tell him how much you love him and always will no matter what the future holds. He\u2019s been through some shit, you both have. He might not be able to look at the big picture right now, so show him a little one, him and you. Him and you against the world. Yes you are his parent legally but you don\u2019t have to be his parent to raise him, he might just need a sibling right now, not another person in authority. He has a case worker and teachers and a therapist and parents, he might just need you. Yelling and fighting never work, especially when it comes to school work, for that I suggest you tell him you just want 20 minutes of his time, 20 min to look at assignments and that\u2019s it. Sit with him. Hang out with him if you can. As a teacher, I hope his teachers are aware of his situation and if they are not I suggest reaching out to the school and explain that he is under your care and you have recently received full custody but there are on going proceedings and I promise that will have some if not all relax a bit on him, give him extra time or a chance to make up assignments. Sometimes, all you can do is love, it\u2019s hard and it\u2019s frustrating when you want a different life for them and you want them to want that too. In the end we cannot make people want what we want we can only show them that when they are ready you are willing to be there.",

        "content": "Has anyone had the up and down emotions of raising someone elses child? \n\nTLDR- I feel im in over my head with a 17 year old who refuses to do anything for themselves, and consistently blames my husband and myself for his childhood issues. \n\nWe are 28 and 29 years old, raising a 3 year old and 17 year old. I am also currently 16 weeks pregnant. We have a 3 year old biological child together. 2 years ago my husbands nephew called us and asked if he could come stay with us. he was 14 at the time. He had been left alone with no water, no power, and no food for days. We went and got him that day and he has been living with us ever since. His mother noticed after 3 days of him staying with us. He does not want to be here, and has made that extremely clear. Yet we dont know what to do because if we have him go back to his mom we know he is just going to end up just like her. But that's the choice he wants to make for his life?\n\nOur nephew  is extremely troubled. He expresses very odd ideals and behaviors in society that simply just dont make sense.  He blames my husband and I for \"being to hard on him\" by simply telling him to get up and go to school. \n\n And I am starting to get extremely concerned and to be completely honest, starting to live in fear. He has a 50 pound unaltered dog (who he refuses to neuter), and my pregnancy is extremely high risk. I am on bedrest and not able to life more than 5 pounds or put more than 5 lbs of force on my abdomen. The risk is miscarriage and preterm labor. This has been made clear and it is extremely dangerous and we could lose this baby. I was coming home the other day, and he was outside and released his psycho dog as i got out of my car. The dog knocked me over, and actually hurt me. (im only 110 pounds so a 50 pound dog running at you can really hurt someone like me) And the look in his eyes was pure satisfaction and he grinned. not a normal grin you guys, like an evil grin. I thought i was crazy, I was like theres no way he did that on purpose he knows how dangerous it is for me. So i said something \"hey man you cant just release your dog like that, that was 150 pounds of force on my abdomen and he actually just hurt me really bad\"\n\nand his response was \"well i guess that would be one less problem for you to deal with\" and that scared me to my core. Im fearful he is trying to hurt me and the baby. \n\nIm frustrated and feel very done with this right now. Its starting to effect my mental health, my husbands mental health (hes an enabler, and he is in counseling trying to learn how to be productive to these kinds of people, as his whole family is drug addicts) and our marriage as well. My husband has the mentality of \"hes been through a lot, lets continue to be patient with him, show him grace, and it will pay off\" (sexual, physical, mental, and emotional abuse from his mother) He has been in vigorous counseling, but refuses to tell us what any of his diagnosis' are and refuses to go to counseling with us as a family unit. also does not tell us what meds he is on, and since he started a new one his behavior has become violent and his ideals are just out of whack.\n\n\"well if you guys hadnt ripped me away from everything i knew, I wouldnt be so sad.\" \n\n\"the reason i am the way i am is because you guys dont do anything for me\"\n\n\\*strongly believes that the nazi party should have won the war and Hitler was in the right, yet claims he isnt racist against jewish people\\* Kid is literally obsessed with Hitler and Nazi germany.\n\n\"well if you guys actually got me my birth certificate i would be able to go get my license and go get a job\" (we told him all he has to do is order one online, hasnt done it)\n\n\"it took you a whole year to get me into counseling and I will never forgive you for that\" (With corona, it was very hard to find  counselor that would take his insurance, and that was accepting new patients)\n\n\"you made me switch schools\"\n\n\"I have no friends because of you guys\"\n\n\"I dont even get my own room here\"\n\n\"Ive been asking you for a week to get me laundry soap\"\n\n\"I dont get any freedom here\"\n\n\"I dont care where we move as long as I have my own bedroom for once.\"\n\n\"you guys are the ones stopping me from getting a job and doing well in school\"\n\nIm frustrated, and at a breaking point of \"honestly man if its so god damn awful here why did you call us and ask if you could live here? this is what structure and stability is like.\" very woe is me attitude.\n\nAdvice much needed, words of encouragement needed. \n\nWe are moving across the country in 2 weeks. And to be completely honest here with my own feelings, im terrified to take him, id be staying at home with him and his crazy dog and my son living in fear. Right now i dont want to continue this living situation. He has been living with us coming up on 3 years now and his behavior has become violent and an endanger to me, my 3 year old, and now my unborn child. Its almost like he wants my husband all to himself, and blames me for taking his uncle away from him. And im the reason he went through what he went through.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "He needs more help than you can offer him. You won't see his respect no matter how much you two give him. He needs a very structured lifestyle to correct the issues he has which he is literally genetically altered to have by the way you described his mother. Get him help and hopefully out of your home and into somewhere that can help him learn to become a well rounded young man. You and your husband played your part for as long as you can, but at this point he is a flight risk and it's not worth battling a soon to be legal adult while your raise a 3 (probably 4 or getting close) and a newborn in just a few short months.",

But we both view it completely differently and need to figure out how to handle it as a team. \n\nMy upbringing was to view it as something to not be shared with everyone. I have only had one partner my whole life and am currently married to said person. I was brought up that when you have sex with someone you are also doing so with everyone they have had it with. This is why stis are so rampant and why everyone for the most part has some form of herpes. I was brought up to cherish it, share it with those you love and not treat it as something to do when you're board, lonely, and looking for self worth. \n\nThe main point only when you know someone, trust someone full heartedly and feel that they are the one that you want to spend the rest of your life with.\n\nMy partner on the other hand believes the opposite. They believe that a 15 year old will do whatever they want and believes in promiscuity is fine, everyone is doing it. My partner has been with about 10 partners and views it differently.\n\nSome background, they where kicked out of the house at a young age and sent to live with grandparents after losing virginity. This has caused a hugely negative impact on there relationship with thier family, self worth problems, etc. Views sex as something to pass the time rather than something special.\n\nNow that thats out of the way the next thing is viewpoints on sex workers (weather online. In-person, on a pole, etc) are viewpoints different as well. I dont want to tell my children that as long as thier happy, go for it is a healthy approach. My spouse on the other hand thinks there is nothing wrong with it.\n\nHow do you guys suggest we talk about it, and what are your viewpoints on the topic. Would like to hear the viewpoints of all because maybe I'm a prude, or sexually immature about the topic. \n\nI do not want to lose a relationship with my children, but I also do not want to promote sexual promiscuity. I dont want to tell my kids thinking ill kick them out of my house if they knock someone up or get pregnant, but I don't want to promote it either.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the matter, how did you deal with the same issues, how did it work out and what would you do differently if you could go back and change what you did, said, etc.\n\nI hope that this will be a healthy discussion and that I can take something away from this that will help in the future. Who knows what the future holds.\n\nThanks to all who participated in the discussion.",

That\u2019s a decision you can make for yourself, but, your husband\u2019s upbringing seems to have also been sex negative, and it ruined his relationship with his family. So it seems pretty unhealthy to replicate the situation that he grew up in.\n\nAre there things your husband could do to make it clearer to you that sex negativity led to his parents being abusive and ultimately estranged?\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned about STIs, bad decisions, poor consent behavior (is your kid a girl or a boy?), then know that educating your children about these things does not have to be done with a sex negative framing.",

        "content": "Vent/rant/ maybe long\n\nTLDR: annoyed with teen\n\n So, my teen (18, non-binary, AFAB, still in high school) has been dealing with depression and anxiety for some time now. They\u2019re taking meds and seeing a therapist. They also developed IBS at some point in the past couple years, also being treated for.  Like, I\u2019ve literally spent 100s of dollars trying to make sure they have a good mental health support system and resources in case they need them. I have been massively open and accepting regarding gender and sexuality concerns. Like, they don\u2019t have any idea how privileged they are to be in a family that just rolls with stuff. \n\nI love them very much, but I\u2019m incredibly frustrated and irritated with them right now. \n\n1) they keep on having issues with friends. Fine, teens.  Whatever. But it\u2019s stupid issues that\u2019s partially their own doing. Instead of listening to their friends and engaging with them, they seem to ignore their friends and center their own problems. \n\n2) when approaching me with a sensitive conversation they ALWAYS do it at incredibly inappropriate times. \n\nExamples: tells me they don\u2019t want to go to summer camp? That they picked out themselves? Two days after I paid for it confirmed they wanted to go, made sure they knew the point of no return had passed. They went to summer camp. \ncome out to me as non-binary, right before I had to go to work. Let me know that they wanted to use he/him pronouns and take testosterone? Pulled me aside when I had company over after a D&D game. Let me know that, in fact, they did not want he/him pronouns or testosterone? Same situation, 6 weeks later. Which, y\u2019all, as accepting as I am some information still needs processing time. \n\nWants to quit their part time job, that they actually have a good time at? Let\u2019s me know while we\u2019re waiting in line to get the dogs vaccinated. Gets upset when I tell them that this is an inappropriate place and time for this conversation. \n\n3) the job thing. They got a seasonal job in November, and were fortunately kept on after season ended. Only once or twice a week, but that\u2019s fine. Better than nothing. But yesterday they said they were having a depressive episode and asked if it was ok that they quit their job. That, btw, they hadn\u2019t been to in a couple weeks due to Covid quarantine. They hadn\u2019t got anywhere except to take they dogs to get vaccinated yesterday. Which is appropriate, because Covid. After they got upset that I shut them down for trying to have a sensitive conversation in the middle of Tractor Supply, they proceeded to complain that I was never supportive of them and that\u2019s why they didn\u2019t like doing things with me. \n\nWell I fucking had it. Without raising my voice, \u201cI\u2019m not going to support you quitting your part time job that you haven\u2019t been to in almost 3 weeks, because I\u2019m not going to support self destructive, unhealthy behavior. We can continue with this conversation later, but this isn\u2019t the place or time for it\u201d. Cue the silent treatment.\n\n4) they complain about never going anywhere, but flat out won\u2019t get themselves places. We\u2019re like a 10 minute walk from the mall. No, I\u2019m not driving you. The weather\u2019s nice, you can walk. Then they get upset at me. \n\n5) their therapist, their psychiatrist, and me have all said that when they\u2019re feeling sad that they\u2019re inside for an extended period of time or stressed that they should go for a walk, maybe get some fresh air. Do they? No. Do they end up feeling worse? Yes.\n\nI get that some of this is probably about control, but I have had it with some of this emotionally self destructive behavior. And yes, I know I\u2019ve likely encouraged it over the years, but Jesus. \u201cSupportive\u201d doesn\u2019t mean being encouraging about every single thing. It means also telling them when they making a bad or unwise decision.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "I think the choosing of inappropiate time (guests over, waiting in line) to tell things might be a way to inform you about something important, but avoid the discussion and eventual follow-up questions.

Might be that they just don\u2019t want to discuss it, but still want to let you know what\u2019s going on.",

        "content": "I am a parent and in my opinion, our current curriculum sucks. In fact, people within the education system for a long time have also been arguing that the current XIX-century way of teaching simply doesn't correspond to the realities of the XXI century. Indeed, the system slightly changes, but not fast enough to impact our kids' generation.\n\nWhat exactly do I mean? A list of missed things could never be complete, so as a starter I'd note:\n\n* personal finance (budgets, credit cards, etc.),\n* cooperation and communication (teamwork, delegation, negotiation, resolving conflicts),\n* mindset stuff like the value of mistakes, creativity, logic, and thinking in general,\n* many other things like health, self-care, and more. Let alone tricky sexual topic.\n\nWhat do you do with them?   \nEducate your kids yourself?   \nJust leave it as a default, 'we have somehow figured it out and our kids should, too'?   \nOr direct them to various online courses and programs? There are many of that kind but seems none of them covers all the missed areas and thus relying on online vocational education we should switch from one solution to another (BTW, if you know a comprehensive resource to rely on please let me know!)\n\nP.S.

        "content": "<<<<WALL OF TEXT>>>>\n\nOr it FEELS complicated, lol. I definitely suffer from some over thinking/anxiety and have gone back and forth on this. This has been years in the making, I don't know how to keep this short.\n\nMy daughter is 14 and in the 8th grade. She started band in the 5th grade and chose the French Horn, the most difficult and expensive instrument in the band. I think she has a natural talent and she also put in a decent amount of work (but by no means stressing herself) and she has done well. She got into Honors band in 7th and 8th grade and in 7th grade got into some all-district type events. If she really put herself into it, I believe she could be exceptional.\n\nCOVID hasn't helped a single thing. \"Real\" band hasn't met in a very long time, we lost her amazing tutor due to COVID lockdowns/his wife being pregnant and she basically just stopped playing. She's due a more advanced instrument and I've been telling her for about 9 months that we will get her one (OMG they're so expensive) but she has to prove she wants to progress in band. Well, that's been an uphill battle. She's been skipping band zooms, missing honors band rehearsals and NEVER practices. If I  ask her to I get pushback and maybe she'll do 5-10 minutes of warmup and quit or she'll just tell me no. But even prior to COVID she wasn't really giving it 100%. She's in regular and honors band this year and I haven't heard her practice a single piece of music.\n\nA few weeks ago it was time to choose her HS classes and she told me she was quitting band and wanted to take art. We had a surprisingly calm conversation about it and she told me it wasn't fun and she was over it. I asked if a new tutor would help, different instrument, etc and she held firm. I accepted her decision and we turned in her class sheet to the school.\n\nUntil now. The high school band director reached out to me, we got to talking and I explained daughter was considering leaving band and my mixed feelings on that. The Band Dir talked to her and worked some kind of magic because now my daughter wants to play the mellophone and march. Hooray, right?? I initially was very pleased but now I'm not so sure. We recently attended a \"welcome\" meeting and I'm having so many doubts. (more on that later)\n\nOur school music program is its crown jewel. They are highly competitive and pretty hardcore. They meet I think 5 hours per week after school during march season, weekends, there are mandatory band camps in summer, they have strict academic standards and behavioral standards. The Band Dir is amazing but is also known as a bit of a drill sergeant.  A lot of this is attractive to me, but my concerns are this:\n\nConcern #1: Daughter has been having some behavioral issues at home. It isn't a COVID thing, has been around before that, but I believe COVID has maybe amplified some of it. Bad attitude, extreme disrespect, bullying her brother and at least one time she got on a kid at the bus stop, she skipped 60 (!!!!) zooms during the 2nd quarter, was borderline failing most of her classes and can be an absolute nightmare. She makes questionable decisions and falls into new \"friendships\" with people online easily (no adults, nothing sexual, but we've nipped all of that, she was sneaking onto social media and zooms with \"friends\" during school time.) She also lacks a lot of common sense and her decision making is not great. She smashed her cell phones this summer in a tantrum and it looks like it got run over by a car, she is not always in control of her emotions. She is deeply immature for her age. Her brother is 12 and I trust him more than her in pretty much every way. She runs very hot and cold, which I know can be standard for teen girls but I also wonder if we aren't dealing with some other stuff too (mental health issues run in both of our families). I have her on a wait list for a new counselor. It's been incredibly volatile at times and frustrating. She has put me in tears. She can be incredibly cruel (but can also be very sweet.)\n\nConcern #2: cost. God, I feel like such a piece of trash even mentioning this bit because I want to give my children every opportunity, but this cost is significant. The joining fee just to be in marching band is $900, MINIMUM. COVID has messed up fundraising which usually subsidizes cost, so this could go up to $1500. On top of this it's about $70-100 for certain mandatory supplies. Also throw in that they have been invited to the Rose Bowl to perform. Originally this would have happened this year and daughter was not eligible, but it's been pushed due to COVID and now she can go. The cost of that trip is probably $2500-3000 and I have to throw down deposits ASAP if she wants to go. Also, as part of the contract we sign, parents agree to perform mandatory volunteer (lol) hours to fundraise. There is a schedule and it's probably a 20+ hour requirement. Oh..and she will need a new french horn for concert band to the tune of $3000-5000 (her grandparents may assist with this part).\n\nLast night I was pretty cranky and told her straight that if I don't see effort from her, band isn't happening. I said she needs to proves she wants this because it's a huge commitment for her, for us in  terms of finances/volunteering/taking her to games/practice and this isn't just something she can be half way on. She, surprisingly, didn't scream at me, but did say she wants to join band. \n\nIf she were putting in the effort, I'd find a way to make this happen (that is a TON of money for us). If it were only a few hundred, I'd take a chance, but she's asking me to take a huge risk on this given her recent track record with band/school/attitude. I am concerned of her getting benched for attitude/grades. \n\nBut on the other hand, maybe the structure and comraderies and social aspect is exactly what she needs to get her back on track. I've had concerns for awhile that my daughter is just lonely and trying to fit (hence some questionable 'friend' issues for the last 3 years). I think there are some esteem issues. We're trying to find things to help her and get her involved in things and I feel like we're constantly spinning our wheels. Husband legitimately asked if we should send her to military school a few months ago because her attitude was so bad (it's been evening out a little) and this could provide some \"rules\" and structure for her. The band kids are known for being well behaved and having good grades -- both of which are things we are desperately seeking. Going to the Rose Bowl is also one of those one in a lifetime things that is pretty darn cool. \n\nI want my girl to succeed. Before puberty she was a bright, compassionate and intuitive girl. I think some of that is still buried in there and I hope that much of this is just puberty and will pass. I could write a book on the hell the last few years have been with her outside the band issue -- and yes, I'm absolutely trying to get her in with a new therapist. The last one was not a good fit, daughter was always very chatty and friendly with her, but it went nowhere. No sex, no drugs, but absolutely a pattern of behavior and choices that has us concerned. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: My teenager is a hot mess right now, has been lazy on band and now has a renewed interest in joining marching band. The financial and time commitment are extremely high and my trust in my daughter over the last few years has been obliterated due to multiple factors. Do we take the chance and let her do it??",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Phew, those costs with joining are WAY more than my experience was, so I absolutely understand cost being part of the equation and wanting to see effort first. \n\nBut just to give my experience being in marching band- It really encouraged me to be better. I was an upright bass player in orchestra/Bass guitar player in jazz band, but wanted to do marching band so picked up alto sax and the pressure to do as well as my peers made me learn QUICK. In my experience, the kids in marching band were more dedicated than the kids in \"regular\" band for the most part. I got exercise because of all that practice, I was too busy to be getting into trouble, that afterschool practice and band camps got lots of playing in to make up for not playing as much at home. I made a lot of friends, I had a lot of fun. It really livened up what was getting to be boring classroom band instruction for me. \n\nI'm guessing rentals aren't a thing near you?? No one owned a mellophone at my school just borrowed it and most people rented their concert instruments from shops all over the state.",

Here\u2019s a little background before I get into it:\n\n(TW)\nI grew up in a family where there was a lot of drug abuse, all of us kids were abused emotionally and physically. My older brother and I were sexually assaulted by multiple people throughout our lives. \nOn top of that I have bipolar disorder, im high functioning autistic, I have anxiety disorders, and developed DID at a young age. \n\nI\u2019m a 22 y/o bio mom with a sweet, smart, and silly kiddo. \nI got pregnant when I was 17, and gave birth when I was 18. He was adopted by his paternal grandparents because at the time I had him I wasn\u2019t emotionally stable, I wasn\u2019t financially stable, and I had no way to give him the resources he would eventually need. I didn\u2019t want to keep on with my family\u2019s cycle of abuse and not being accountable for their mental health and how that effects their kids. \n\nHe is 4 now; and it\u2019s an open adoption. I see him yearly on his birthday, I call, I send cards and presents for him and his other adopted siblings. I love going clothes shopping for him and getting him books, because when I visit he has me read to him when he\u2019s in the mood for it. He doesn\u2019t know that I\u2019m his \u201cmom\u201d because it\u2019s a concept he\u2019s struggling with right now- but he does know I\u2019m \u201chis special\u201d.\nI miss him like crazy, but I can see that he\u2019s thriving and doing wonderful. He is also being screened for autism, he goes to swim lessons, his communication skills are advanced for his age and he loves his siblings too. \n\nDespite all of this sometimes I feel like I made the wrong choice. It was worse in the beginning when he was first adopted. I was told that Being a parent to a child means doing what is best for them, even if it\u2019s those hard choices you don\u2019t want to make but you know it is the better option. \nAnd I know that despite how much I\u2019ve grown since I was just a silly teenager, and even in the last 6 months- I\u2019m still not ready for a child financially and I\u2019m still working on the mental/emotional part.\n\nI go through all of the \u201cwhat if\u2019s\u201d of him hating me, or feeling unloved, any question you can really have about what might happen to your own child when they aren\u2019t raised by you.\n\nA large chunk of me is consistently confident I made the right choice just by seeing who he is and how he is doing at his age. How happy he is and how safe and cared for. \n\nA small part of me says I\u2019ve permanently messed up a child by letting him be openly adopted and not practically living next door to see him every day and reassure him that I\u2019ll always love him. \n\nI\u2019m not a perfect person, I definitely have a lot of growing up to do and mistakes to make up for and behaviors to correct. \n\nI guess I want to know how you feel about adoption? In my shoes was that a choice you could or would make? Did I permanently mess up the one person in this world that means the most to me? Am I just letting people psych me out of what was the best decision I made for him?",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "I personally would never have an open adoption. If I chose adoption it would be closed.  We can discuss that if you want but since it's not the choice you made I'm not sure it matters what I would have done. \n\nThe reservations you are having about him loving you are your emotions. Not his. You made a risk assessment and decided to do what was best for him. Him knowing you love him isn't about him. It's about you. If you do nothing else he will know you love him because you put him first. As long as you continue to put him first that won't be a concern. \n\nYou made a hard choice.  It will continue to be hard as you get snap shots of his life. Know you did what you thought was best and that's all any parent can hope for. We all second guess ourselves. All we can do is manage moving forward and be the best version of yourself for the both of you.",

        "title": "How do I have the puberty and sex talk with a pre-teen who may not be ready for it?",
        "content": "TL;DR Need to have serious discussions about puberty and possibly sex with my pre-teen, who is very skittish about growing up. Unsure about the right path to take...\n\n\\--------\n\nI need to have the Sex Talk with my son (12M). I know that sitting down and having \"The Talk\" is not the recommended way to teach kids about sexuality, but that's just how things have shaken out with my kid. While puberty hasn't started full-force with him yet, there are some minor physical changes (thicker leg hair, more muscle tone). He needs to know the details of what is going to happen over the next few years, both in terms of physical development and the emotional and sexual changes.  I need to have one good, comprehensive conversation with him that touches on as much as I can. I don't think he could handle multiple \"sessions\". I fully expect him to cry and/or have a nervous breakdown because I'm forcing him to think or talk about puberty and sex. \n\nHe is very fearful and anxious about growing up. He hates when I point out that his pants are too short for him or that I can't rest my head comfortably on his when he asks for a hug. He still thinks two characters on tv kissing is gross. He has gotten the puberty talk from his teachers the past few years in school, but he doesn't like it. Last spring his 6th grade health teacher had them do a remote learning assignment  (powerpoints and vocabulary lists) for male and female anatomy. He had a breakdown when he saw the assignment, and cried for about an hour. I had to email the teacher to get him excused because he was in so much distress over it. She was very sympathetic and understanding, but I was not happy about it.\n\nHe knows the very basics of sex. When he was around Kindergarten or first grade, I got him an age appropriate book on human development and read it with him. It had an accurate description of sexual intercourse and where babies come from, in addition to talking about a variety of other things relevant for little kids (body parts, \"good touch bad touch\", families, non-heterosexual relationships, etc.) But he was very uncomfortable, and we've never had a direct conversation about sex or reproduction since. I make a point of talking to him about once a year regarding physical and sexual abuse, bullying, and coming to us for help, but it's more of a one-way lecture, and he's very uncomfortable throughout.\n\nOn the other hand, there are a lot of things about sex that he understands on an intuitive level. He's always been interested in the news, politics, and the movie business, so back in 2017 when the MeToo stuff came out, we had a lot of conversations about Harvey Weinstein and all the other predators who were in the news at the time. It was very difficult to have frank but age appropriate conversations about those topics without actually saying \"Sex\" or \"Rape\". But he did understand, and would sometimes comment on things like unequal power dynamics and gender issues without me prompting him. He's really into Harry Potter, so talking about JKR and transphobia this summer was an interesting time.\n\nMy dilemma is twofold: Would it be better for me to force a conversation about these issues, no matter how distressing or traumatic it is at the time, or should I let him just grow into his body on his own, even though he'll be confused and possibly ashamed (because he doesn't understand what's normal)? And secondly, how do I approach this in a way that is as easy as possible for him?  I'm thinking of finding one or two good websites or YouTube channels that have accurate information, and sitting with him to make sure he actually reads it and doesn't run away. I don't know where to start looking, though. \n\nI'm also unsure of what information he \"needs to know\" vs. what I can let him explore on his own as he grows up. My initial instinct is to talk about puberty and development in boys, go over the basics of sex again, sexual and romantic feelings, briefly touch on sexual orientation and then talk about consent and relationships (although I don't think he'll be ready for that for a very, very long time). Not sure if a discussion of STDs and birth control is going too far, depending on how clinical I can make it. \n\nThanks for reading my word vomit...",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "What you need to do is talk to him about why the idea of growing up and hitting puberty scares him so much. \n\nMy 11 year old (12 in December) is nervous about some parts of it, too. His biggest worry is that his personality will change. He's a very sensitive kid, in touch with his emotions, he likes having in-depth conversations about a large variety of topics, and he can express himself quite well compared to what's expected from a kid his age. He's scared of losing these qualities and turning into a stereotypical quiet, grumpy and/or potty-mouthed teenager. He also used to have a friend who underwent a big personality change after hitting puberty, so it has been on his mind even more since then. When it comes to the physical changes, he's mostly looking forward to them, though he's worried about what happens to his singing voice once his voice starts changing. He's someone who worries about a lot of things and doesn't take change all too well in general. \n\nAnyway, what I'm trying to say is, there's gotta be a reason why your son cries for an hour when he has to learn some anatomy stuff for health class, or why he has been blocking these conversations since he was really, really young. I'm not saying anything necessarily \"happened to him\", but it definitely sounds like he's really, really anxious about something. Either it's something directly related to puberty and sex, or it's one of the indirect consequences (for example not being that close to you anymore). Maybe he doesn't want to grow up in general and feels much safer being little and feeling protected. Especially in such a chaotic, fast-track world, leaving the safe \"bubble\" of home and childhood can be scary. Of course, now that he's hitting puberty, gets more responsibilities and has entered the social minefield of middle school, he probably really notices this. He feels like he's being thrown into the \"real world\" and doesn't have this same feeling of \"Everything is going to be okay, my mommy and daddy are there for me\" anymore, that he had at age 6, for example. \n\nEither way, it's time for a long conversation about *this topic*. You can't start having open conversations about sex and puberty until you have addressed his anxiety.\n\nIn case you won't get anywhere with these conversations, I'd recommend getting him a sex Ed book that covers puberty and the basics of sex and masturbation for 10-12 year olds. Let him read it by himself, and on his own terms. That way, it will be less uncomfortable, because it's less direct. Give him a little book with blank pages, that he can write questions in. If he has a question, he can drop the book off in your bedroom, and you will then write him an answer. One of my friends on here does something like that with her 12 year old, who also isn't super comfortable with talking about these topics. It seems to work very well for them, so it might help your son at least a little bit.",

        "title": "Daughters in nicu and I can only see her once a week feel like an awful parent",
        "content": "**TW domestic violence**\n\nI don\u2019t even know where to start but this will be a long story. I had my daughter at 28 weeks 2 weeks ago and she\u2019s currently in nicu. I can only see her once a week and it\u2019s killing me, I feel like such a bad mum. To avoid confusion as I know this audience is predominantly American, I\u2019m English. I\u2019ve never told my full story but I will try too as I think it will help. \n\nI was born 32 years ago addicted to heroin, I was in hospital for weeks whilst I was put through withdrawal. My mum was and is a heroin addict, I never knew my father and my mum didn\u2019t know either (she was working as a prostitute to support her habit so it\u2019s likely he was a \u201cclient\u201d.) my mum and my Nan were estranged. However when I was born, social services managed to contact my Nan and informed her of my birth. I was sent to live with my Nan who had custody of me all of my life. She was amazing, I consider her my mum and called her mum but to avoid confusion il refer to her as my Nan. She worked full time and provided an amazing childhood for me, she made sure I stayed in school and even helped me through uni as her dream was to see me graduate.\n\nAt 20, I met my husband whilst at uni. He WAS amazing. He was so supportive of me and he was lovely, my Nan loved him. I graduated at 21 (the same time as him) when we graduated we both went to live with my Nan to save up for a deposit for a mortgage. At 23, we moved out but still lived local to my Nan. I was working as a legal secretary and he was working as a quantity surveyor and we had finally saved enough to buy a home. \n\nAt 24 we got married and had our first child when we were 25 (who is now 7) I returned to work 8 months after his birth and things were amazing still. At 27 I had our second child (who is now 5) this time I became pregnant again unexpectedly very soon after and I was suffering very bad with post natal depression. I was put on antidepressants as a result. My waters broke early and I got sepsis and I had to have an emergency c-section at 26 weeks. She lived for one day but unfortunately, the infection took over her body and she died in nicu. This devastated me and I\u2019m still heartbroken, and this is where things started to turn bad in our relationship. \n\nMy husband blamed me for her death because I was taking anti depressants even though my doctor said it was safe and says it wasn\u2019t a factor at all in her death. Although I can\u2019t help feeling guilty as he has got it into my head over these years that it was my fault. \n\nHe began controlling me. It\u2019s better if I just bullet point what he did and what I wasn\u2019t allowed to do:\n\n\u2022He would force me to have sex with him if I didn\u2019t want to have sex. He forced me to have sex 5 days after my c-section which was 4 days after my daughters death.\n\n\u2022He wouldn\u2019t let me return to work as he thought I was cheating.\n\n\u2022He began beating me for small things like not having his dinner done on time or not having the house cleaned to his liking. He didn\u2019t do this in front of the children initially but then he started to do it in front of them despite them screaming at him to stop. I ended up in a&e several times but I always told them fiction about how it happened. He also used to put his cigarettes out on me.\n\n\u2022He would accuse me of cheating if I went out alone even to the shops with the kids to the point were I just did not go out because I was afraid of his accusations because he would beat me.\n\n\u2022I wasn\u2019t allowed to see any friends, he estranged me from them all and replied to their texts being nasty to the point were they didn\u2019t want to be friends with me anyway.\n\n\u2022I was only allowed to see my Nan with him present.\n\n\u2022He had complete financial control, I had no money. He paid all the bills and groceries, I wasn\u2019t allowed to have any input. I had to beg him to buy the children clothes. When my Nan gave me money for birthdays etc even when she gave the kids money for their birthdays, he would take it off of me/them.\n\n\u2022He would cheat on me and video the sexual encounters and make me watch them.\n\n\u2022He told me if I tried to leave him he would get custody of the children and kill them in their sleep.\n\n\u2022He got me pregnant a further two times when I told him I didn\u2019t want another baby. He wouldn\u2019t let me be on birth control and he wouldn\u2019t have protective sex with me. He would force me to have sex or I would just submit because it was easier than getting beat then raped. He wanted me to be pregnant because in his mind if I was pregnant, then I couldn\u2019t cheat or leave him. As soon as I had my 1.5 year old he made me have unprotected sex with him. I begged him not to get me pregnant as I had a c-section and my doctor told me not to get pregnant for atleast another year as my uterus tissue was thin and I would need another c-section due to having 2 already. Despite this he still got me pregnant and put my health at risk which he thought was funny. \n\nMy Nan knew something was up but I never admitted it to her but she just knew. She begged me to move in with her and bring the kids. She offered me money to get out of it. She tried her best to get me out of the situation but I was too stupid and stubborn to listen to her and it\u2019s my biggest regret because she died knowing the situation I was in. She died a year ago and left me a large sum of money from her house sale. When I got this money, I got it taken from me by my husband who said he put it into our house to reduce mortgage payments but I have no idea if he really did this or just kept the money. \n\nI have a 7 year old, a 5 year old a 1.5 year old and a newborn who is in nicu because of prematurity and is expected to be there until late November at the earliest.\n\n4 months ago I decided I had to leave, I was pregnant and he was abusing me and broke my ribs in front of my children. I tried for several weeks to leave but I couldn\u2019t as I had no money. \n\nI was desperately looking for his bank card or any money and in his underwear draw, I found an envelope containing \u00a32000 in cash. I quickly packed a bag for me and each of our children, a supermarket carrier bag. I took the cash, the children and our possessions and I left. \n\nI got on a train and went to its final destination which was 100 miles away from our home town (where we were living) we stayed in a hotel whilst I looked for somewhere to live. I was able to put a deposit down to rent a 2 bedroom flat which was all I could afford which we are in now and I don\u2019t care that we haven\u2019t got much space I\u2019m just so thankful I\u2019m away from him and safe I love this new place because it\u2019s safe.\n\nI admitted the children to a new school and the fresh start was going well. I had to claim benefits because I didn\u2019t have an income and I couldn\u2019t  get a job as I was pregnant and had a young child. The benefits mean that the rent on this place is paid and although I don\u2019t have a lot, I have money to at-least survive and I\u2019m so thankful to the gouvernements support system for that.\n\nWhen we got on the train, I chucked my phone away and I got a new phone and sim. I haven\u2019t heard from    \nhim, he doesn\u2019t know where I am. He reported me missing and the police made contact with me, they visited and they went to him and told him I was safe but informed him that they couldn\u2019t disclose my location but just told him that me and the children were safe. They advised him to take legal action if he wanted to see the children but told him that\u2019s all he could do. He hasn\u2019t (to my knowledge) taken any legal action because I haven\u2019t received anything. To my knowledge he doesn\u2019t know where I am, he has no way of knowing either nor does he have any way of messaging me. Of course everyday I live in fear that somehow he\u2019s found out. I even found someone on social media that was advertising their dog for free (a German shepherd) and I took him in primarily for protection. He is an amazing dog and so protective of me and my children and makes me worry less.\n\n\nI have no one around here, no friends nothing. I have an uncle and cousins who live in Australia but I\u2019ve never met them and I\u2019m not in contact with them either (I don\u2019t even know how to contact them.) \n\nMy neighbour is helpful but she herself has 4 children (one who has cerebral palsy) and she works full time as a single mum so she\u2019s very busy as you can imagine. She looked after my children whilst I gave birth two weeks ago. I barely know her but she came round when I moved in and told me to ask if I needed anything. When my waters broke early 2 weeks ago, I had no other choice but to ask her to look after my children. She did so for 3 days whilst I was in hospital which resulted in her having to take time off work and loose pay so she was not happy with this.\n\nI self discharged 2 days after birth because I knew I needed to be at home and couldn\u2019t keep expecting her to take time off to look after my children. My baby girl in nicu is thankfully fine and doing so so well, she\u2019s not even on any oxygen.\n\nI intend to start legal proceedings with my ex partner as soon as I can afford to, to divorce him and to get my share of the house so I can move on and rent/but somewhere more suitable. I intend to start work as soon as my newborn is six months old and can be put in to childcare.\n\nHowever I can\u2019t visit her at the moment, only once per week. My kids are at school during the day apart from my 1.5 year old and due to Covid, she isn\u2019t allowed in the hospital at all. My child\u2019s school has a nursery attached to it and I spoke to them about putting her in there but the prices are far too high and I can only afford one day per week which is \u00a335. This means whilst she is at nursery (on Tuesdays) I have from 9-3 to visit my daughter in nicu. I spent 2 days with her after she was born and have seen her twice since.\n\nI don\u2019t really even know what she looks like, of course I phone everyday to get updates that\u2019s how I know she is doing well. I wanted to use my milk but obviously I can\u2019t so she\u2019s having formula, I can\u2019t cuddle her, I can\u2019t nurture her, nothing. I feel like such a bad mum. I spend most days inside just crying looking at the few photos I have of her. I\u2019m broken. It\u2019s not just with her, I feel so sorry for my children at home too. They\u2019ve seen a lot of abuse between my husband and me. It got to the point where my two eldest would stay up till 1am because they were scared he was going to \u201ckill me\u201d in their words and they\u2019d try to get me to share their beds by pretending they were sick. They also pulled him off of me a lot of times, mainly when I was loosing consciousness and I would hear them say \u201cget off my mummy\u201d it broke my heart. I know I\u2019m away from that situation now but the trauma I suspect, will stay with them forever. I just feel they deserve so much better. I\u2019ve even considered adoption (of course I do not want too at all but I just feel they deserve a better mummy.) I\u2019m not going to give them up of course, but I just sometimes think it would be kinder on them to do so because they deserve so much better than me.",

        "content": "This is long so tldr is that my teenage son is refusing to come down for the court ordered summer visitation and he wont talk to me much at all anymore. \n\nI dont know what to do. I'm heart broken and depressed. I think my oldest child hates me now and theres nothing I can do about it. \n\nMy first born lived with me until he was 3.5 years old. Right just before he was 3 I had left for training for a job that didn't work out and I left him with my mom for that time. His father wanted nothing to do with him during his first few years and had barely started seeing his son so I didnt feel right leaving our son with him solely. I was gone 1 month and 6 days in my attempt to build a better life for my son and I. \n\nBeing gone from my young child like that did a number on me and i was a mess by the time I was able to get home to him. A few weeks after returning home I was sexually assaulted. I was not doing well and my mother continued to bulk of the care of my son. I had turned 18 about 2 or 3 months prior to these things happening. \n\nWhile i was trying to recover mentally, my mom sent my son to live with his dad against my wishes. She told me it was best for him and I believed her. He immediately cut as much contact with my son and I as he could. He even went as far as literally forcing me to sign papers only allowing me to see our son every other weekend.\n\nFrom there I spiralled pretty bad and started seeing a therapist regularly and got on meds. Once I hit 19 I got on some medications that were starting to help. I started going to the community college. And I got a vehicle. As soon as I started doing better I started pushing for more time with our son. My ex took him and left the city. Every few months they would contact me and let me see him. I never knew the address and when i did find out where they lived they would move. They would constantly change their phone number and I couldnt afford a lawyer. After a few years of this hell they moved back to tucson.\n\n I used the documentation I had stating every other weekend to force them to allow me visitation. This was going well until our son started telling me things like his father told him his step mother was his real mother, that I didn't really love him or want him. I started to repair my relationship with my son and show him and tell him how much I loved him and wanted him. \n\nWhen my son was almost 10 he told me he didnt want to kill himself but that he wanted something else to kill him. I took him to a behavioral health place to get him help. They spoke to him with me and then alone. They gave me a referral and a paper stating that he was being abused at his dads and that he was showing symptoms of suicidal ideation. \n\nHis father refused to allow therapy and since we technically still have joint legal decision making they wouldn't see him without consent of both parents. Then my ex said they were moving out of state. \n\nI borrowed money and found a cheap lawyer. My son came over again and his father made him take a cell phone. I found bruises on his arms and took pictures. My son told me how his step mom would punch him or grab him and sometimes made him bleed from the pinches. \n\nAfter he returned to his father I found the cell phone in his room. I went through it and found countless texts between two adults about drug deals and selling pills. His father or step mom doing the selling and people texting to buy. This was the phone that was left in my kids care. I made a police report. I printed screen shots of all the texts and gave everything to my lawyer. \n\nWhen court happened my lawyer didnt submit any of the evidence I had compiled against my ex. This included threatening texts from my ex about letting them move or he would disappear again with our son and other things. \n\nDue to a clerical error my mom still had my portion of custody (I was 15 when I had my son). So that messed up the court hearing and they wouldnt talk to me because apparently I was not the legal guardian at this time even though I had visitation papers. The court let my ex move with our son as a temporary thing and I got everything transferred into my name. \n\nMy lawyer continued to tell me he would submit the documents eventually (before the next court date) blah blah blah. And he didn't. I lost another court hearing which ended up with me only getting a total of like 4 weeks a year with our son. \n\nI borrowed more money and hired a better lawyer. She ended up getting me most of his school breaks but by that time he was in school and the courts deemed a move of households and schools wouldn't be fair to my son. So I was stuck. \n\nEvery time my son came out to see me I had to repair my relationship with him all over again and when we finally got to a good point he would have to go back to his fathers house. \n\nHe was supposed to come here for 10 weeks this summer. This is in the court papers. My son refused to fly so we agreed to come and get him and drive. He refused to come at all and stated he wouldnt even leave his bedroom. His father told me I had to agree to only 4 weeks and that's it or I wouldnt see him. \n\nI called my son on the cell phone that my husband and I pay for and asked him why he doesnt want to come here. My son said he doesnt wanna be stuck in a \"2 bedroom studio in the ghetto\" and that hes realized all of the lies ive told him \"over the years\". I know I have never lied to him about anything except things like santa or the easter bunny. \n\nWe have had some financial issues during his time here where we weren't able to do everything we planned but ive tried making up for that with quality time spent together. \n\nSince all of this he wont tell me what he believes ive lied about. The police In his city wont help without a court order stating that they have to. I called them. My son won say anything more to me except \"I love you and miss you too\" and only in response to my messages. He wont talk to me at all beyond that. \n\nI explained to him that we pay for his phone so that he and I can have a relationship with each other. That got me a couple short responses and then it was back to silence with the exception of the love you miss you too. \n\nHe wont talk to me, he wont let me talk to him. My lawyer said I could file papers holding his dad in contempt and force the issue but im afraid doing that will just hurt my son if I force him down here. \n\nI cry every day and this has been going on since early to mid May. My younger son is heart broken. I hide as much as I can from my younger son though because I dont want him to know how hurt I am. My oldest doesnt really know much about that either. \n\nMy husband wants to cut my oldests phone service temporarily as punishment. We havent sent his birthday gift to him because we always give it to him in person when he comes down for the summer. He even refused to come down for his brothers birthday. \n\nI'm so lost and I would really appreciate some advice.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "This is a really sad story. I would absolutely not cut this child's phone service. If he's in an abusive home, he needs contact with the outside world that isn't tied to his abusers. And there's nothing to punish him for. Yes he is making you sad, but if what you say is true this is the result of years of parental alienation efforts on his father's part. He's an abused child. He's acting out on a person who he considers somewhat safe, I'd guess. Don't cut him off because of that. \n\nSend him his present. Stay low key in contact. Send a funny pic once in a while, or a pic of his brother. Just say hi, no obligation to write back just thinking of you. A few times a month, don't be overly in touch but let him know you are still there. \n\nThings may change as he gets older. Just keep on being there for him even if it's not in person right now.",

She came over for a visit, her mom and my wife and I were chatting in the lounge room while the kids played.\n\nWe first noticed inappropriate signs when the she took him into the cubby house and covered it with a blanket, and then it was quiet and we could hear kissing noises. She'd poke her head out being cheeky and saying she's having a baby.\n\nHer mother explained her daughter knows about the \"birds and the bees\" . Whereas my son doesn't know anything about that stuff yet.\n\nLater the kids went into my sons room, us parents were having a good chat and realised it was a bit quiet after a while. My wife went to the door and heard her say \"just get it out\". My wife went into the room and was stunned! They were laying in the bed together, his pants were down and she was playing with his penis.\n\nShe immediately stopped them, we later sat down with our son and tried to have a talk. He won't tell us anything, we haven't been approaching it in a bad way or anything, we know it's not their fault, she seems to be wanting to explore it a lot. But I'm sure a lot more went on because they were in there for a while, we just thought they were playing with their toys.\n\nEvery time they catch up now, she keeps trying to explore with him, mostly just kissing and holding hands. We don't let them be alone without supervision anymore. \n\nWe don't know what to do, I feel like he's waaaay too young for any of this, he calls her his girlfiend and in a serious way. I feel like he shouldn't have to worry about this stuff for another 10 years. I worry it will can effect his mental health, especially if he has to go through break ups already. He's 5!\n\nAnyone else been through anything like this, or have any advice?",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "How close are you to the girl's parents? You're approaching things perfectly with your son, but that sort of behaviour is raising some massive red flags for the girl. If you're close enough to the parents maybe see if you can suggest counselling for the daughter - children experiment but not typically to that extent at that age.",

        "title": "I should have listened to my gut instincts",
        "content": "I posted here exactly 200 days ago about my stepson confessing his love to my daughter. You can see the original post through my profile, it\u2019s very detailed.  I had also posted the same topic on the Stepparents sub and the majority of the responses I got were that there wasn\u2019t anything gross or creepy about my stepson telling my daughter he loved her. In fact every adult we talked to about this incident wrote it off to \u201cnormal teenage boy hormones\u201d. I vehemently disagreed, but decided to heed all of the advice we got from outside sources (not just Reddit) and move past it. I shouldn\u2019t have done that. Here is the update with the basic pertinent background information included for those that don\u2019t recall.\n\nHusband and I have been married/together for almost 15 years. We were both previously married and he brought two sons (ages 19 and 17 years old) into the marriage and I brought two daughters (ages 20 and 18 years old). We have one son together who is 12 years old. Up until two years ago, both of his sons lived with their mother in another state and my daughters and our young son lived with us. His youngest son (17 years old, turning 18 years old in 26 days) moved in with us two years ago. It has been a very rocky road for everyone adjusting to him living here. Before moving in, he was homeschooled his whole life and VERY much sheltered from the real world by his mother, as much as humanly possible. He is extremely socially awkward and has no idea how to make friends or interact with people whatsoever, despite our best efforts to help him. Because he and my 18 year old daughter were in the same grade (Juniors when he moved in, they just graduated in June), she basically became \u201cresponsible\u201d for him as his only friend inside and outside of school. She has hated it all along and I don\u2019t blame her, but my husband feels sorry for his son because he is incapable of having the social skills that most kids that age have. \n\nThis past winter, our family was in turmoil after stepson sent a text to my daughter one night telling her he was in love with her. Understandably, every ounce of trust she had in him was destroyed and she felt violated and disgusted. My immediate reaction was that stepson needed to get out of this house and move back with his mother because my daughter would never feel comfortable around him again and neither would I. EVERY adult we talked to about this said that I was making a bigger deal out of it than needed to be and that we needed to address the situation and move on from it. So despite my instincts telling me otherwise, that is what we did.\n\nTwo days ago, my daughter texted me asking me to come to her room immediately. When I go upstairs she is sobbing hysterically and tells me (and shows me) that stepson had placed his phone in her room while she was in the shower and was recording video of her getting dressed after she went back to her room from the bathroom. She went though his phone and found he has been doing this for quite some time because there were NUMEROUS videos of her changing and undressing dating back to at least 6 months ago. He had been putting his phone in there while she was showering and then after she leaves her room once she dresses, he would sneak in and grab his phone back. Many videos of her completely naked.\n\nI told husband the kid needed to get the fuck out of my house NOW. That even I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with him here. Husband once again played the \u201che\u2019s my son, I can\u2019t just throw him out\u201d card. I said bullshit to that, stepson is a mentally ill pervert and I will not have him in this house as long as my daughter or I are here. That trust is gone and he absolutely disgusts me now. I took his phone from my daughter and he will NOT be getting it back. Now husband and I are at major odds because although husband admits what he did is sick and unacceptable, he\u2019s responsible for him as a minor and can\u2019t just throw him out and get rid of him like trash, even by sending him back to his mother.\n\nThe next morning, husband had time to sleep on it and realized I was right, we need to protect my daughter and she is at risk as long as stepson stays in this house. Within 8 hours of the incident I took my daughter and left the state for a week of vacation that had already been planned, though we were not supposed to leave for a few more days. In the meantime, husband spoke with stepsons mother and she agreed he needs to go back to her. He has a stepsister there too, so I am truly concerned for that household as well. I wanted to call the police, press charges, but he is a minor and my daughter is 18 so husband was of the impression that it would basically be like pressing charges on HIM since stepson is not yet 18. I have purchased a one-way ticket back to his mother\u2019s, he will be gone before we get home from vacation. She is going to get him some mental health treatment , if that\u2019s what he needs. I cannot and will not ever trust stepson again. He is not showing he is remorseful about what he did, he\u2019s remorseful he got caught. He has continued to lie about EVERYTHING since getting caught. He admitted he did it, but said it was only a few times and only started to do it recently. I have video evidence that proves otherwise. \n\nSo basically what I want to say is, if you ever have a situation like the one we had 200 days ago, don\u2019t blow it off and chalk it up to hormones or let anyone tell you it\u2019s not unnatural or unusual. I wish I had listened to my gut at the time. I hate to think how much more this could have progressed if we hadn\u2019t found the camera. My daughter is going to need a LOT of therapy to overcome this. He is a sexual predator plain and simple.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "If he's been recording her for this long, it's likely some of those videos have been transferred from his phone to a computer or external hard drive already. They could also be backed up remotely (iCloud for example). I would have his other electronics searched before he's able to leave with them. I'd hate for him to a) keep them or b) share them publicly as revenge.",

        "content": "I don't even know where to start here.  I may be overthinking it because of my current state of stress.\n\nMy son and his best friend (both sixteen, nearly seventeen) dated for a short while after being friends for a long time.  Then after the breakup, they reconciled.  Both have minor mental health issues (depression) that at times have been worse than others.  B They are exceptionally close.\n\nMy son came to us a few months ago, after we moved out of state, and said that his friend wanted to visit some time this summer.  We said sure, and he said \"how about late July?\" and we said sure.\n\nSince that happened, our lives have literally fallen apart in a big way.  My husband had a mental health breakdown and was put on a medication that made him extremely violent (with me, not the kids), to the point that he was arrested and I had to get a temporary restraining order.  Because of this, CPS got involved.  He also lost his job because of it and we have both been unemployed for months and are dangerously close to homelessness.  However, overall, trying to look on the bright side, things are good and improved in many ways- no more violence (he was taken off the meds) and CPS is really pleased with our progress, compliance and initiative to change and improve.  Everyone in the home is getting mental health help as needed and everyone is happy and healthy for the most part.  Husband does struggle and so do I, especially with the court stuff, CPS, and finances hanging over our heads.  But we are handling it all really well.\n\nHowever, with all of this, I TOTALLY wasn't thinking about my son's friend coming.  Until two weeks ago when he said \"She bought her ticket, nonrefundable!\"  I was totally in shock.  Her mother is one of the most overbearing, strict parents I've ever met.  It was implausible to me that a ticket would have been purchased without her mother even confirming a visit with me.  I haven't spoken to this woman in a year and a half.\n\nSo, I called her.  She confirmed that the tickets had been purchased.  She also told me that the kids are planning on having sex and that she is holding my son personally responsible if this happens.  She said that it would 'remove her daughter's value' and that her daughter has worked too hard in therapy the past year to lose her virginity to a boy she isn't even dating any more.  She said that her daughter's therapist does not necessarily agree with her on this.  I don't either.  But I also don't want my son going down for something like this.  And I don't want to be responsible for it happening under my roof.\n\nI'm also not sure if I should tell her about the open court case and CPS case.  There is nothing unseemly happening in our home, no drug or alcohol abuse, no physical or emotional abuse.  CPS is finishing up the mandatory period they have to be involved, but believe everyone to be safe.  Our home is overwhelmingly a happy and safe place.  But, these are factors that are at play right now.\n\nI'm angry with my son for not telling me about their plan.  We are an open family and discuss sex and relationships freely.  I had asked him outright and he lied to me.  I was shocked to hear her mother tell me their plan.\n\nMy husband wants to cancel the trip.  I'm not so sure.  These are good kids who are just KIDS and have both been through so much and have looked forward to this a lot.\n\nPlease, I can't take anything else right now so if you are in judgment of me, please move along.  Any sincere advice is much appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA spoke with son and he says she has these plans but he has told her he isn't interested in a sexual relationship with her.",

I had gastric bypass over 2 years ago and lost nearly 400 lbs. Now, relearning to eat was eye opening. We eat at home most of the time and get something out maybe once a week and sometimes once every two weeks.\n\nSince I barely eat since surgery I love love love to cook. I dunno why but it's satisfying to see people enjoy something I create instead of actually eating it myself. I've gotten quite good at cooking healthy delicious meals. Daughter has always been interested in culinary so it's been good bonding as well.\n\nHowever, she is 13. And, everything has to be sweet or extra beyond max. She gets up in the morning to get ready for school and she will make a 4 ounce coffee and put at the very least a cup if not more of creamer. Today for lunch she made a grilled cheese. No biggie. But, she spread extra butter on it when I was done and then grated fresh parmesan on top. I get what she was going for but she didn't stop there even after I commented that maybe the parm was excessive. She made another one after that and ate it too. \n\nI was visibly upset that she was ignoring me and wife whispered for me to just let it go. Wtf?! Why?

        "content": "This ended up being tremendously long, and if you made it to the end I appreciate you more than you know. Brevity has never been my strong suit, and I honestly could not explain our situation without certain details.\n\n\nOn mobile and did a big chunk of this using speech to text, was such an exhausting process that I did a shit job proofreading. I'm also impatient and desperate to hear what anyone else has to say.\n\n\nHey guys! I've had a reddit account for 6 years, but made my first throwaway ever today in order to make this post.\nAnyway,  quick backstory. Mom to Dear Daughter, 15, and Dear Son, 10, us 3 living with my SO of 5 years.(Two living together)\n\nSO has no bio kids, nor do we plan to have any. He has happily taken on co-parenting with me. DD and DS's bio dad passed away 9 years ago, when DD was 6. I have had her with a regular therapist pretty much ever since her father's passing. She had the same one until two years ago and we relocated to a much larger town compared to where we'd been living.\n\n\nDD has always suffered from some mental health issues. When she was younger it was separation anxiety, social anxiety, as well as general troubles making and forming lasting friendships with her peers. As a grade-schooler she was extremely small, definitely a follower, and often the target of bullying. \n\n\nShe doesn't have many extracurricular activities. Many she's tried and given up on shortly after. One thing she has always stuck with has been her art.  She would literally stay in her room and charge 24 hours a day if we allowed her. All allowance/xmas/birthday monies are spent on high end markers and tablets. \n\n\nShe is passionate about LGBT rights. In fact she announced herself to be Bi around sixth grade, and then gay later that year. This was long before the onset of puberty, and she's yet to have any type of romantic attraction with anyone to this day. I tried telling her that it wasn't necessary to decide or her claim on any sexual orientation so early in life. I realize that some people are keenly aware of Their Own by this age and before and all I can say is that I know my daughter and I don't think that is the case. She has since claimed a lot more of her own authentic identity. Currently she no longer advertises her sexual orientation at all, and has told be she doesn't know and hasn't decided. I include this information not because I care either way but I don't want it to show her penchant for... I don't know...embracing the idea of being different. That being oppressed, to be what some view as damaged, is something that can make her unique and special. \n\n\nThis year she moved from her middle school on to being a freshman at a HUGE high school. She has formed friendships are they tight group of girls who are very much like her an absolutely good kids. Sweet and relatively innocent doe their age,  and in no hurry to grow up too fast as I see so many others doing. She has other friend groups as well.  She is still alive with her local GSA (Gay Straight Alliance) as well as a group who meets weeks for Dungeons and Dragons campaigns that take all day long. I love it. It was finally starting to seem as though she was coming into her and honestly thriving. She has also been seeing a therapist who has a straight office in the high school.\n\n\nDD has always had a tendency to play up her mental issues. Often her demeanor will change like hitting a switch as soon as she was in any therapists office, or inexplicably the day/hours leading up to a session, she would wax mopey, etc. \n\n\nI explained this to her current therapist when she first started seeing her (not able DD was present) and we seemed to be on the same page, that therapist would consider and factor DD's histrionic tendencies. She alluded that this behavior pattern was not something that was uncommon to see in teens.\n\n\nI've been told by multiple people who are close to us both that she manipulates me like no other. It's rarely malicious, or even conscious, but she knows what to do to get what she wants. She also Harbor some resentment for SO even though he loves her dearly. He is also the stricter out of the two of us, only because he wants to instill the kids with the same values he was brought on, and wants to make sure they become hard-working responsible members of society and all that. To her he just gets in the way of her and What She Wants...which was a lot easier to obtain when it was just us three \"against the world.\"\n\n \nI recently caught DD in a relatively big ongoing lie and then another lie + a deception on top of that. I grounded her more severely than she ever has been. Two weeks with no cell phone, no activities outside of school, and for the second time ever I temporarily confiscated her art supplies. It's one of the few consequences I can impose that she actually cares about. \n\n\nOne week into this grounding I get a call from her counselor, it's urgent. DD reported to this week's session saying she was having thoughts of committing suicide, and she even had have a plan in place to do it. Pills somehow she didn't know which ones. We don't have any narcotics in our home,  only it's drugs,  which I realize can be misused as well. \n\n\nOn her therapist recommendation I took her to the emergency room where they admitted her to hey Jupiter orbital health ward for 5 days. Basically they had her on lockdown when she went to group therapy and talk to a psychiatrist daily, they talked more about school she gave use when she was feeling depressed and anxious, etc. etc. \n\n\nIn the meantime I was having frank conversations with school therapist about my suspicions.  Therapist is now saying basically DD couldn't possibly be manipulating or exaggerating the situation. Therapisqt basically says what would DD possibly have to gain by threatening suicide if she was not being genuine? \n\n\nI don't see how this is even a question. DD  \nknows it's the hot button, hold the phones Trump card.\u00a0So she would be escaping the consequences of her current punishment (so she thought, but actually i put it effectively on pause) She would be getting to miss school for a week. Those reasons alone I would consider sufficient gain for her to cry suicide.\u00a0\n\n\nBut even on a more basic level. What does someone with Munchhausen have to gain by feigning physical symptoms? The attention and concern of others. Actually if I'm going to draw that parallel I would have to say I feel that DD has one part of that syndrome but also a sort of mental hypochondria, in that she's convinced herself she *should* be mentally unwell,\u00a0 and togethers those serve to manifest her depression. That sad, I believe that she genuinely does experience depression and anxiety. I feel like all these perpetuate one another.\u00a0\nI realize being a teenager\u00a0is incredibly and inexplicably difficult, at least from their vantagepoibts. I also know that a person can experience depression for no discernible reason.\u00a0\n\n\nShe does seem to like to present as angsty, troubled (especially in front of mental health professionals). A vague mention of her Mental Health is her go to excuse. Even though it really works that's her first line of defense. She's also always at it with the self-depreciating humor. It's part of how she identifies herself.\n\n\nBut if you could only see her during the times she not putting on (what I believe to be) a show for anyone. What I think is her true self, with all her many defenses down. She giggles with her brother or with friends until she's gasping for air. She dances and does funny voices. Her old Russian Lady is spot-on and truly oh, she can and will stay in character for hours just to annoy / entertain us. DD is also a moody B. And cops an attitude and gets sulky and pouty ONLY when she doesn't get what she wants, or has to do something she doesn't want to do. And even then she's over it as soon as it begins. These selfish tendencies had always been a problem, but they went into overdrive with the arrival of puberty. I was starting to suspect that we had surmounted the worst and she was on her way to actual maturity.\u00a0\n\n\nWe have heart to hearts and she never mentions being sad or upset. We talk openly and honestly about the past. About her dad. About her relationships with me and DH and with her friends. If she keep something from me it's because she's afraid of getting into trouble. I made it a point she make sure she knows she is allowed to have her feelings and won't get in trouble for feeling them. I'm pretty sure she shares the brunt of her problems and worries with me, they seem mild and infrequent, rarely ever devastating, even to her.\u00a0\n\n\nObviously I am not the professional here, so forgive for my armchair diagnosis. As you said I do my my daughter, and this is all just my opinion. My...feeling, I guess.\u00a0\n\n\nPlease believe me,  my children are my everything and if I sincerely felt that my daughter is the kind of mental anguish that\u00a0 would drive her to that brink, I would be stop at nothing to focus on changing that.\u00a0\n\n\nIf I am wrong and way off base with this,\u00a0 I realize the stakes are such that it definitely at the very least warrants this inpatient stay along with my support.\n\n\nShe was discharged a few days ago and has been acting happy as a clam ever since. My suspicion is this is because she got her \"attention quota\" for the time being, and then some.\n\n\nI just would like to hear from anyone who has had any experience with a similar situation. Ultimately I would like to remove her from therapy if it's just going to perpetuate this behavior, which I believe it will. if someone has a better suggestion I would absolutely love to hear it. The same goes with any inside or personal thoughts on my situation. Thank you so much in advance!\n\n\nTldr: I strongly suspect teenage daughter is being disingenuous about her mental health in order to gain attention. At my wit's end and don't know where to go from here.  I feel like I look like a shit parent if I even suggest that I don't believe her. \n\n\nEdit: SO many mistakes.  I'm sure there are many more. \n\n.",

Was she able to access art supplies at the hospital? How much attention did she get once the claim came out? Was everyone hysterical and worried? Or calm and \"professional\" about taking her to the hospital?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other thing I do agree with is overload her with attention now that she is out - by treating this as a serious threat to her life - which it could be. Ensure that she is not left at home alone. Do not allow access to sharp objects, if she needs asprin - I'd ask a few more questions than you normally would ask a child before giving it to her - and watching her take it - even checking her mouth - before locking the medicine back up. Treat her like someone who has just admitted they have thoughts of suicide by being supportive - yet very very watchful. If she complains about the lack of privacy - explain to her \"I have to keep you safe\". Either way - you're doing the right thing, because if she is manipulating the situation, she'll quickly learn how boring and tedious it is, and if she's not - well you're keeping her safe.",

        "content": "My daughter just turned 5 and is at a great age to start developing friendships and spend time with friends.  The problem, though, is I can't seem to get the parents to ever call me back/consent to a play date.\n\nThe thing is, I'm a normal guy with a warm, gregarious disposition.  I don't think I'm being weird about it or anything.  So for instance, my daughter just recently made a really good friend in pre-school, is always talking about her, etc.  So I struck up a conversation with the parent of said friend in the parking lot of the school and mentioned that our girls were friends, and that maybe we should get them together for a play date.  The parent said \"sure.\"  We exchanged numbers and at spaced out intervals I dropped a text to see if the kids might get together at the park or something.  I asked twice over maybe 2 weeks, and the parent mentioned they were busy and never made a counter offer (aka, never said anything like \"Hey we're free Monday afternoon!\")  So I took that as a sign and gave up.\n\nThis seems to keep happening, sometimes with just no reply by text what so ever.  Am I doing this wrong?  I'll admit that ever since my eldest daughter was born, my wife and I have had near 0 social life.  Our eldest daughter had severe health issues so being primary caretaker and working a job and retraining my skills left me with 0 time to socialize or \"make parent friends.\"\n\nI can't tell whether parents now a days are just shut ins or if maybe it has something to do with the fact that I'm a father, and most primary caretakers are mothers and would prefer to just hang out with other mothers.  My wife is way more shy than I am, but she's actually had mothers come up to HER to arrange play dates in the past.  Maybe there's a better angle to this that I'm not really seeing?\n\nI'm not a weirdo or anything.  I have a lot of positive relationships and developed friendships with my customers through work and employees despite being too busy lately to develop conventional friendships.  I have a great relationship with my wife, and we've been together since we were 15.\n\nAnyway, it's not a huge deal, but its just frustrating, and I want my daughter to have more 1 on 1 time with friends outside of the context of school so that she can hone her social skills.  Any ideas?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the ideas guys, it was really helpful.  Advice so far for anyone just tuning in: \n\n1. Try to take the responsibility and the thought process on yourself and come up with the details (time, date, place) yourself,  It makes it easier for other people who also have busy lives.\n2. Make the play date at a public place first, like a park (was already the plan in my case, but good idea for anyone tuning in).\n3. Multiple friend playdates that also include food.  A birthday party with friends from school/gymnastics etc,  Gives you a good chance to get to know all of the parents rather than during the hustle and bustle between pick up and drop off at pre-school.\n4. Don't also invite the parents?  This seems to be some people's advice, but at least in our area, this would be considered something a serial killer might recommend.  I imagine it really matters whether an area has a \"community culture\" or not.\n5. If you are a father, many women will think you are trying to hit on them under the guise of trying to be an engaged parent.  This really surprised me, but hearing it repeated often here sort of made it hit home for me.  It makes me sad, but ya gotta live in the world that is, not in the world as you wished it was.  So rather than navigating around this sort of \"masculine original sin,\" I think I'm better off just trying to ferret out the primary care taker dads out there and stick with that.  One way around it might be if kid's-friend-in-question is being raised by, like, a 70 year old grandma and no one can confuse your friendliness or parenting with a sexual advance.\n\nAnyway, thanks for the perspectives!  My 1 hour morning-Reddit-and-Coffee session is over.  I appreciate the pointers.",

        "title": "Looking for mental health resources for me (32f) and my son (10)",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm looking for online resources, advice, personal experience stories, support...anything really to help my family navigate my sons mental health. \n\nI will start by giving some background. I am 32 and have had depression from 17 years onward. I've been seeing the same therapist on and off for the last 10 years when post partum depression almost killed me. My husband has had an anxiety/panic attack disorder since he was a child, about the same age as our son. My dads side has a history of suicide and my inlaws side has a history of violent mental health moments. I was sexually molested as a child (family member, now deceased) and several times as an adult (strangers). \n\nDue to PCOS, an onslaught of antidepressants and self medicating leading to unemployment I didn't know I was pregnant for close to 7 months. My son definitely had a tumultuous fetal life, with limited nutrients, stress, and intoxicants. I was very unhealthy but stopped everything as soon as I found out I was pregnant and tried to recover healthy habits quickly. \n\nMy son was born and I experienced wicked post partum. The first moment I walked into the bedroom with him after leaving the hospital I was on the floor sobbing. A feeling of hopelessness consumed me for 3 years, when I finally started to feel like I could be close with my son. In the meanwhile he and I had an amazing support system in my family and my I laws. My son is and always has been loved more than life by our families and us, though I had a very hard time expressing it and I constantly think I'm a failing parent due to my resistance to him when he was born.\n\nHe's 10 now, just turned 10. He's been expressing anxiety here and there for a year or so and my husband has tried to relate. Last night at 10pm he came downstairs and told me (my husband was at a friends) that lately he's been experiencing a lot of sadness and isolated feelings. That he doesnt feel like he makes anyone happy, that he's always nervous, that people pick on him (this isn't new and we've met with the school a few times and I document all his school complaints). I asked him if he feels safe with me and his dad (he said yes), I asked him if anything happened where he was hurt in any way and other than verbal teasing he said no. I tried to think of any mitigating factors and how he's been coping. I asked him if he was hurting himself or had thoughts of suicide, he said no. He says he feels really scared at night to the point where he feels frozen in bed. That he has an imaginary friend (a ball with stars?!?) and he's grateful his cat sleeps in his room. All this seems like it was bound to come up eventually and now that it has I feel completely unprepared. The kicker though, is that last night he says he always feels like whenever he's alone \"something\" seems close by and it scares the shit out of him. He says he feels like someone is always watching him. When he was younger (3ish) he would say that someone was close by and even named it but over time it stopped coming up. \n\nWe're looking into him switching school now. I have told him that his family is not judging him and we want to help him and make him feel less isolated and scared. I plan on putting him in some form of play therapy asap. I'm really feeling lost though and a sense of urgency and am struggling. I want him to feel safe and secure, valued and loved. He's not and I don't know what I can do RIGHT NOW to help him. I am open to all suggestions, advice, ect. Sorry for the long post. Please no judgements. I will answer any questions to the best of my ability.\n\nAbout his home life now: lived in the same house for 6 years, which we own. We have pets, can do better with routines but for arguments sake we aren't struggling and the home is nice and comfortable. We generally eat vegetarian at home and spend some time outdoors but can improve. My son mainly sticks to reading and video games for hobbies.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "ohmygosh!\n\n\nYou all need some help and support!   I would suggest you redouble your efforts at getting that asap.  A nice Christmas present.\n\nAt 10 and given all of your history, if I could ever so respectfully recommend not so  much \"Play\" therapy, but therapy with a vey experienced child psychologist, who can make the determination of the type of therapy would work best for him and all of you, this sounds very much like family therapy too.\n\nAlso, with his consent and involvement, talking with  the school people so they are aware and involved to help smooth those edges is a good idea, too.\n\nGood  luck, take it slow, put one foot in front of the other, but get started on finding a good psychologist now.",

        "title": "Is it too early to think about sex ed?",
        "content": "TL;DR\n\nMy son is three and I'm considering writing a guidebook for him about sex/dating so that when he is old enough for the talk he can have my experience at his disposal even if I am not there.  And I would like thoughts and ideas from the community at large \n\nFull rant\n\nI am the (male) non custodial parent of a three year old boy.  His mother and I get along well, so no issues there.    The thing is, due to several factors in my life (high risk work, mental and physical health issues, political climate, etcetera), I worry I might not be alive when he becomes a teenager.   While I trust his mother to do her best, (she is a highly competent person and loving parent) I am afraid that there are certain things she cannot understand and relate to, and that this lack of understanding could potentially have a ruinous effect on our son's outlook on dating (and therefore sex.)\n\nThe thing is, while his homelife is much less toxic than mine was, and his mother, stepfather, and I work as a team to make sure he is healthy, happy, and strong, I still worry about his future.    He is so much like me.   The way he thinks, the way he talks, his physical appearance how quickly he has developed . . . and his emotional reactions.   All just like me.   And I worry that while he doesn't experience the abuse I did as a child, the inability of his other parents to understand how he operates emotionally will stymie their ability to help him develop healthy means to cope with unhealthy emotional responses.\n\nAs a teenager, I developed a lot of unhealthy expectations of relationships.   This made dating a nightmare, which (due to lack of effective guidance) caused me to develop an unhealthy attitude towards women that I was not consciously aware of until well into my twenties.   (Eventually, I figured it out, made adjustments, and am much better now.)   I want to make sure that my son not only avoids the emotional trauma I experienced, but also avoids being toxic towards anyone he dates.   Neither of his other parents understands rejection in dating because neither of them experienced it much, if at all.   Neither of then really understands bipolar disorder, because they haven't lived it nor have they educated themselves on the subject.  (Of the three of us, I am the only one who has any understanding of psychology or has even been to college. . . and I dropped out).   Furthermore, sex ed in schools doesn't cover things like consent, responsible dating, laws related towards sex, or how to value oneself.   \n\nSo I am considering writing a \"book\" containing every bit of wisdom I have acquired through education and experience.   Things I intend to cover:\n\n1) Consent (in depth)\n2) How to respect women\n3) How expectations shape our experience\n4) Why to date someone and why not to\n5) How to cope with rejection\n6) Sexual orientation and how to respect it\n7) How to have a healthy relationship with oneself\n8) Laws in relation to sex and sexuality\n9) How to pick up potential dating partners\n10) The importance of masturbation\n11) How to be a good relationship partner\n12) And yes, even how to be a skilled/considerate lover.   (That shit is important too.)\n\nReally, even if I haven't managed to die on the job or end up in prison for something stupid like losing my temper in public, it might be good to just be able to hand him a notebook when he hits thirteen or fourteen.\n\nIs there anything I missed that should go in there?   I want to make sure that he is equipped to walk into adulthood as a genuine force of positivity.",

        "content": "I am a father of a 22 year old college student. She is very successful, has good grades, and a bright future. She graduates in the spring. College has been very hard on her between pressure to do well as well as a sexual assault that happened her freshman year. \n\nHer mother and I put her in therapy her sophomore year  (which she requested) and found a good psychiatrist for her. She was diagnosed with major depression, anxiety, and unstable mood/borderline bipolar disorder. For about two years the therapy and medication seemed to be working and we have seen a huge improvement in her mood. \n\nRecently, in the past month however things have seemed to be regressing. She\u2019s had two suicide attempts in the past month, one where she was sent to the ER for overdose \u2014 she did not react well to this and kept demanding to go home. Then last week she almost overdosed on another one of her medications, was told to go to the ER and refused. She also refused to see her psychiatrist after the incident. We also believe she has developed substance abuse issues and have offered to pull her from school for a semester or two but she refuses stating she wants to graduate on time and \u201cdoing nothing would make everything worse\u201d. \n\nShe\u2019s becoming belligerent towards the therapy and thinks that it\u2019s not working and that the medications are making her worse than better. This concerns me because I\u2019m scared she\u2019s going to cut the meds cold and quit therapy. Because she\u2019s an adult I do not know how to handle the situation as she becomes aggressive and angry when her mother and I try to weigh in and help and shuts down. She says the medications make her feel sleepy and zombie-like and blames them for her suicide attempts. She also believes that everyone is angry at her for such attempts. \n\nTl;dr: Adult daughter with multiple mental health problems is beginning to regress and is starting to show signs of wanting to stop medication and treatment altogether. I don\u2019t want to lose my daughter. Please help. \n\nEdit: it should say in the past month, not year.

People become suicidal when they lose all hope, not because they want to die. \n\nI don't know if you are even able to approach her about something like this, but maybe you can find her inpatient treatment somewhere where they specialize in trauma or cptsd. A lot of sufferers of complex ptsd are initially misdiagnosed. You also mentioned that she was sexually assaulted, so it may be worth reading up on. \n\nIf she is not improving in therapy, it may be that her therapist isn't trauma-informed.\n\nI am sorry she's suffering like this.",

I don't want to say too much about the specific situation, but those of you who suspected she is going through something major suspected correctly. She told my husband she was sexually assaulted at a party recently and has been \"messed up\" ever since. It doesn't excuse all of her behavior, but it obviously makes us all a hell of a lot more sympathetic. My husband is working with his family members to make sure she gets the help she needs (vague to protect details). I feel awful that I immediately went to anger instead of concern, and it is a good reminder to be open-hearted.\n\nThis will seem petty in compassion, but we also discovered that she tried to steal our Nintendo Switch from us (her mom found it in her suitcase and told us it must have \"fallen\" in...even though they were at a hotel). She also tried to claim that my necklace was hers and that we have the same one (it was custom). So we're trying to figure out how to separate what happened to her and dealing with that with kindness, compassion, and support...while also holding her accountable for her behavior, over time. Easier said than done, especially because her mom is an ostrich about this issue. But at least we have a baseline for what is going on. Obviously her safety and mental health are paramount, and come before the behavioral fall out from the situation.\n\nFor the time being, she won't be spending time with our daughter.

        "content": "Hey guys. I decided to sign up for reddit for some advice on a new issue in my family. I turned here for the anonymity, for my childs sake. \n\nMy 17 y/o daughter recently had a miscarriage. About a week ago, she cried out to me from the bathroom that her period had been extremely heavy, to the point that there was something off, she also hadn't been due for it. \n\nWe decided to go to the ER, they took her blood as well as urine. Once back in the room the doctor informed us that she was indeed pregnant, and that they would perform an ultrasound on her.\n\nAfter the ultrasound the doctor informed us that no child was visible and that my daughter had a miscarriage. It was all within maybe 20 minutes. Such an intense flurry of different emotions at once, we were due back on the 5 day mark for them to draw blood and make sure her HCG levels had gone down and they did. \n\nEver since then she's been super depressed and guilty and I feel her pain. All she wants to do is sit in her room, she graduated from HS a semester early and is ready to go to college this fall, she hasn't left the house and she hasn't had a phone for a few months since she broke it. Im just worried about her she struggled with her mental health in the past, and has been suicidal, she hasn't even asked to see her boyfriend. She was about 7 weeks and has told me she had no idea. My father told her it was a blessing in disguise and she let him have it, she didn't want a child, but she didn't want to lose one either. I have tried to make her feel better, I myself had a miscarriage as a teen and knowing that its only been a week I am aware it will take time Im just so worried about her. I don't know the usual age of the children we talk about on this sub but maybe some other mom has been through this and has advice to offer?\n\nAnd before anybody judges me, my daughter hadn't ever made me aware that she was sexually active although it is something that I commonly ask, she is on the pill and I've purchased condoms for her.",

        "content": "I apologize for the wall of text, I'm on my phone at work with no access to a PC. Also, post was removed from /r/Relationships and I was recommended to post it here.\n\nI live in a foreign country with my family due to my husband and I work. The past couple of months I noticed that my daughter is not the same, she has been spending so much time in her bedroom, I don't blame her, there's not much to do where we live, but it is unusual behaviour since she always knows how to keep herself busy and have fun. She was also extremely hot tempered and would cry for no obvious reasons. I thought it was hormones/homesickness, etc... I even thought of sending her and the children back home to stay with my mother. \n\nShe would also keep her phone hidden from, this I could not find an explanation for, so I went through her phone. I found explicit content on snapchat chats between her and this 37 year old guy. She had no idea what sexual intercourse was and he taught her everything, even showed her porn videos, most of which were weird kinks and young girls being beaten. He constantly tells her how much her likes young girls!!!! He used fear to keep her going, and would constantly tell her hid the snapchat chat so her parents wouldn't see it. She is wrapped around his finger that every time he was not happy with her, she would send him nude pictures of her (I'm not sure if she did though because snapchat deletes photos once sent, but his reactions on the chat and specific requests (wear this, show me that, I love your breasts...) would tell me that she sent him nude pictures.) I also found video requests from him with specific instructions on how she should act. As a reward he would send her nude pictures of him (porn websites are blocked where we live so he is her only source)\n\nWhat scares me the most is that he painted this image to her that he's not a bad guy at all. He told her that he's a \"sex coach\", I don't even know if such thing exists. He constantly warns her about talking to other men or sending nude pictures of herself to them, and that he only asks her to send them so he can coach her so that she's ready for it when we go back home (adultery is illegal where we live), so she really really thinks that he's a good guy. She's absolutely clueless on how perverted this guy is. And she is also scared, I could tell from their interactions that she was not enjoying it and only sends him photos so he can assess her physique and coach her for life when she goes back home.\n\nThis guy lives in Italy from what I gathered, he didn't give her any personal information. Not even his face. I tried contacting the authorities in Italy so we can work this out, but they told me since its happening in another country, there's not much they can do because it can be legal where we live. \n\nI am mortified. I took her phone, I told her because she has to focus on her school, she didn't mind or throw a fit. Then a few days later her snapchat was logged out from. Which means she logged in from another phone. I'm monitoring her closely, the isolation and anger that she had is no longer there but I'm afraid she has a hidden phone somewhere. I can tell that she's damaged mentally from their interactions, so the last thing I want to do is confront her. I read a few months ago about a teenager who committed suicide when his parents found out he was watching porn. I know its extreme to think this way but I don't want to damage her more. I feel like there is a way to wave this whole thing away without having \"the talk\", I want to talk to her soon, but without confronting her. He used the fear approach with her all the time, thats why I can't bring myself to confront her so that she doesn't get even more paranoid.\n\nPlease I need help. I think I'm cross-posting this post to a legal subreddit, to see if we can prosecute this guy. But what do I do with her? I'm afraid they're still talking, only less than they used to because I took her phone.\n\nTldr: 13 year old daughter has been sexually talking with a 37 year old man. Sending nude pictures and erotic videos whenever he'd request. I took her phone but did not talk to her about it. I believe she's mentally damaged because when she had her phone, she showed symptoms of isolation and depression. I believe she's talking to him again with a secret phone. Looked through her bedroom and school locker, NOTHING. I don't want to cause further mental damage to her by confronting her. I'm wondering if there's a way we can get her back to safety without scaring her and further damaging her mental health.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "If she didn't know what intercourse was prior to this then maybe that's the best place to start. If you don't want her to know you've seen the messages then you could sit her down under the guise of a \"sex talk\" and go from there. \n\nDepending on the relationship you guys have, this conversation could naturally lead to this subject. My mum had a sit down with me at a younger age than that. She was raped by her father's friend at a young age and her parents never believed her. Our relationship has always been really open and in our talk she covered what was and wasn't appropriate interaction between someone my age and an adult (obviously based on her experience). She talked a bit about grooming etc which could be a great way for your conversation to develop naturally.\n\n Let her know there are people out there who will pull all sorts of tricks to get what they can from young girls and boys and that fear is a method of control. Also let her know to never be ashamed if someone has put her in a situation that is bad and she can always come to you no matter what. Make sure she knows she won't be in trouble and that you're always there for her.\n\nI know 100% I could have gone to my mum in this situation. Although probably would have taken me a couple of days to think about it first. Once she knows for sure that she's not in any trouble she will come to.you or her dad. Being away from friends and family, she has probably gotten caught up in a 'new friend' and things have escalated from there. I have no idea how to go forward from that point, but if you go to the police with anything, I wpuld probably let her know but also down play it a little on her end, she's probably going to feel all kinda of upset and horrified once it comes out.\n\nI hope this is some kind of help for something.

        "content": "When my daughter asked for my help to get her on birth control I was just glad she was being responsible with her health as she was just starting high school.\nWhen she asked me what she had to know before and during having sex and she was 15, I thought oh well, if she's going to anyway... Tried to let her know I wouldn't get in the way\nbut to consider all the things that might not make it a good idea, but otherwise told her how I imagined a sex life should ideally start and maintain so that she'd be as safe as a sexually active\nteenager can be. And I accepted there was definitely someone she intended to use that wisdom with. She has since mentioned a boyfriend here and there. Not a surprise.\n\nHowever we had never met the boyfriend, and it's much more of a surprise to learn that he is a 27yo adult leaving in a neighborhood nearby. He is apparently an engineer living alone in a house he bought recently.\nLikes the same music, TV shows, video games and outdoors stuff as her. Just doesn't acknowledge anything is off here.\n\nI started to talk to her about how they were going to cut all contact, and she told me she didn't want to and we couldn't force her to. I told her I didn't want to just let her see it but he was going to jail\nfor this and she told me to try and we'll see about that.\n\nI have a friend who's a criminal lawyer and I gave her a call. Bad news. She told me I have no say in my daughter's sex life, and either what happens is illegal and I can report it, or legal and I'll just have to\nlet it be my daughter's problem. In this case, she is 15 and consenting so it's legal. She brainstormed with me a few other angles to press charges on him. She asked if she spent nights at his house (obviously without\ntelling me) but no, she had a few unsupervised nights out that I suspect she spent with him but it was not under his control and we had approved the night (aware that she'd see her boyfriend but trusting we had taught\nher to be safe.) She asked if he was waiting to pick her up outside her school but apparently not. She asked if he was giving her gifts that would make her depend less on us (and therefore undermine our authority and\ndepend more on him) but I didn't notice anything. She might have gotten a couple of jewelry, though their \"relationship\" covered Christmas and her birthday so apparently it's questionably abusive gifts. In other words\nshe was trying to find ways to show the boyfriend is overriding our authority on our daughter but we couldn't find something a court typically acknowledges. I'd need to find out dirt on him that isn't related to his\n\"relationship\" with her, it could be enough just to demonstrate he displays obscene characteristics. That would enable to come to court and say he's voluntarily endangering her with his corrupting lifestyle.\n\nBut so far, my friend says I have nothing, laws are just what they are.\n\nSo I went to have another discussion with her, acknowledging that maybe, indeed the legal route wouldn't have the effect I thought. But we could still force them apart, by just sending her away and force her, by our\nlegitimate authority, to stay there. She told me he would follow her and that would be the same as here. I told her we could buy him out to break up with her. She told me good luck with that. I told her we can have\nconstant surveillance on her by driving her from/to places and grounding her to the house. She told me that's the same as denying her a life, and if we do that we can forget about her being honest with us, she'll just\ntell us what we want to hear and lie her way into getting her life back, never forgetting we locked her up in the house. In a nutshell, it looks like she won't accept we just tell her to separate from him.\n\nI took her mobile and decided to look through it, and I noticed that actually this guy is not completely on the same page as her. He said in their latest messages, clearly after she told him they were caught, that he\nwouldn't help her destroy her relationship with us, her parents. That he will not encourage her to escalate a conflict. That if we say we will force her to break up, he will comply to our will rather than let her fight\nus on it. He also says that when she'll be 18 we will have less control on her life and we will be the ones to be forced to accept a lot of what she wants if we want a loving relationship with her, but before 18 it's\nthe other way around and he will not help her destroy our loving relationship. So he told her she can go back to him after she's 18 and so if she wants, and all he can do now is promise her that he will be patient and\nfaithful to her in the meantime, and not expecting the same from her nor that she will necessarily go back to him.\n\nI'm starting to think that looking at the situation from a distance, this guy is a little reasonable in this issue, a lot more than my daughter at least, and there may be some value talking it out with him directly\nrather than just trying to submit my daughter into obediance. That would have to be me alone talking with him though, because if my husband was involved there would be no talking and the person in prison would be\nmy husband soon.\n\nThink that in this horrible situation, the least bad I can try for is to talk to her \"boyfriend\" about how they must separate?\n\n---\n\n**Short update:** I'm overwhelmed and thankful for all the attempt to help me. This is really appreciated. But I can't answer literally everwhere so I have to pick where I do. I promise I read everything direclty responding to me though. I'm doing this short update to give an idea where we're at now.\n\nThe police, as my friend predicted, is taking it a lot like \"it is not our job to find for you something illegal about two persons who want to have sex legally.\" Apparently the law says at what age justice is interested to know, and beyond it it's not and they are tired to have to give explanations.\n\nBut I have since become terrified that the nuke approach would break something too big with my daughter and I's relationship. Okay she didn't want to tell me about her boyfriend but beside her love life, we were so close and loving! I gave her her mobile back, apologized for reading it, and told her we need to be open to each other about the situation, but it's making everything complicated as her dad will not be calm about it when he knows.\n\nI called the boyfriend and he was surprisingly well-spoken, polite and understanding. He confirmed that he did not want to help our daughter antagonize us and he would break up with her if that's what it boils down to. But we agreed that my daughter is not stupid: if we decide to make him break up with her she will see it as her parents forcing the separation even if he agrees to it. I've decided to wait and see a little for now and not try to separate them until further decision, so that my daughter won't hold it against me. We've actually hugged and talked about good times again, that we had together, that she had with her friends, that she had with him. It's... not like one would imagine. It's confusing.\n\nI invited the guy to have a meal with us, but not dinner. Too soon to involve her father that I don't want behind bars. We're all free for lunch today so that's when we'll have him. I will ask him why he's dating someone so young and what he thinks about their difference of place in life and maturity. Also what about women his age.\n\nI don't know what next but I hope my daughter will realize it is all legitimate conversation and food for thoughts.",

        "content": "Anger is a dark and almost constant shadow but last night I hit my 13 year old son. Hard. I slapped him 4 times across his face. Later I found there was blood in his mouth.\n\n\nI dont want to justify because there is no justification for what I did. But I do want to tell you what happened, I think there are 3 reasons. I need to get it off my chest. I need to be villified. I need help.\n\n\nThe day was nice, our family of 4 [wife \"A\", oldest son \"K\" 13, youngest son \"R\" 9 and me mid 40s] were sitting watching TV. The boys started arguing and jumping on my wife [who was ill] and not listening to her requests to stop.\n\n\nI felt my irritation rise. \"Will you guys just STOP! Do what your other is asking, you know she is now well!\" Then the oldest turned to me challenging, shouting at his brother and using foul language.\n\n\nMy irritation progresses to mild anger. Threats of punishment [taking away privilages eg XBOX etc] only partly get him to stop. My wife wants him to try some new clothes we bought for xmas and he keeps saying \"no\" then \"ok, i WILL!\". I need to leave the room, I go to the bathroom.\n\n\nWhen i return my wife is still asking him to try the new clothes on and he is still saying \"I will\".  No longer at mild anger. Just anger now. So I shout at him to \"get up and try on the clothes!\". He responds with shouts and comments like \"what are you going to f***ing do about it?\". Im telling him \"thats enough, go to your room\", his response is \"no, you cant make me, what can you do? Ill do what I f***ing want\"\n\n\nIve left anger and am now enraged. We get into a shouting match, the atmosphere is hirrid, my wife is trying to calm me down, R is crying, K and I are shouting at each other. His next comment is the one that I reacted to with violence. And I hit him. Hard. Harder than I think. Not just once, 3, 4 times across the face. He doesnt back down and keeps going. At some point I had him by the throat. My wife is screaming at us to stop. R is traumatised, sobbing. My wife tells K to get out of the house after she cannot get him to stop screaming and shouting.\n\n\nK goes to our neighbour wanting to phone the police but the neighbour brings him back saying he needs to talk it out with me and his mother. My wife is too angry with K and they start arguing again, then he leaves and doesnt come back for over an hour. Its a very cold winter night and all he had on was his jumper.\n\n\nI cannot look at him, nor he at me. He goes to bed without another word or look to each other. This morning he leaves for school. He will be back in a copuple of hours and I dont know how to talk this out. I dont know if I deserve to talk this out with him.\n\n\nIts the first time I have ever done that and the shame and guilt are destroying me. I haven't cried since the death of my father 10 years ago. But today I haven't stopped. I'm ashamed of myself and my self pity. I don't know what to do.\n\n\n................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n\n\nUPDATE\n    \n\nThank you. For sharing your own experiences, for sharing your outrage, your advice and your compassion.\n\n\nI read the majority of the replies before some were deleted so I have seen the full force of emotion, and I'm glad of it.\n\n\nI want to describe my/our situation a little more if I may. Please try to understand I am not trying to excuse, only describe because some questions have been asked.\n\n\nWe live in the UK. Child protection laws are as stringent as you would expect of a civilised culture, so yes this incident does fall under the jurisdiction of the law.\n\n\nK has braces, when I hit him I caused his check to bleed. I did not strangle or choke him, but I did grab him by the throat for more than a second but I think less than 3. I cannot say I did it gently, I honestly don't know how hard. There are no physical marks, bruises, swelling or cuts. But I do know I hurt him. \n\n\nMy own up bringing is complicated [a euphemism for abusive], for the most part verbal and emotional, sometimes physical by both parents [some instances I think deservedly so - my own behaviour was unacceptable at times] and for a short time sexual by older step siblings. Again, not an excuse, I am a grown man, I know right from wrong, I know the consequences of abuse which is why this incident has affected me so much. That's not the man I want to be, its not the father I want to be and its not the husband I want to be.\n\n\nOur family unit is happy for the most part, we have arguments and disagreements as much as any other family, and the boys are like Tom and Jerry at times, but I wouldn't describe it as out of the ordinary. Its difficult to say that, I don't think anyone really knows the full extent of unreported incidents of abuse like the behaviour I put my family through the previous night.\n\n\nI have shouted and I do shout more than I think is reasonable or warranted. I have never reacted like this though. It was shocking for me, so I am pained to think how it affected my family.\n\n\nWe love each other, I/we make a point of telling each member of my family members I love them many times every day, but more than that, I try to show how I love them. We hug and kiss each other every morning and last thing each night.\n\n\nMy son K, one of the things I love most about him is his fierce independence and self reliance. R is a very loving and kind soul and my wife A is a woman of exceptional virtue.\n\n\nFor my own part, I am not a drinker or rather very occasional drinker. Never on my own and for the most part only small amount when I do - for example I haven't had any alcohol for several months. The last time took me nearly 3 weeks to drink a 75cl bottle of red wine. I do sometimes smoke pot, again rarely and lightly. However, that hasn't always been the case [both alcohol and drugs which I did abuse as a teen/young man] but that changes before my wife and I were together.\n\n\nMy anger has always concerned me and several years ago I decided to better myself and eventually came upon Stoicism and Buddhism, including varoius meditation practices and physical exercises. I have tried to make myself wiser, stronger and better. Although I am a far more capable husband and father than I would have been in my younger days, the events of the prevoius night showed that I have not succeeded on my own.\n\n\nSo, we have all sat down and discussed as a family, and I thank you for the advice on how to approach this.\n\n\nI started with saying that there was nothing to be worried about in this discussion, honesty was what we needed. Most of the conversation was geared toward K but every one was included. I apologised for my actions, the shouting, the slaps to K and grabbing him by the throat [explicitly]. I made apologies to each family member in turn for the wrongs I had done them. I made it clear that I know it was not OK in any way and I do not want forgiveness until I prove myself.\n\n\nWe agreed to use a \"safeword\" in future that anyone can invoke. The safeword means that everyone stops right then and goes to their own place in the house. For a min of 10 mins but that we return to the main living area when we are ready. The safeword is to be used before anyone gets to the point where the safeword is ignored, so before the shouting and anger rise out of control.\n\n\nI have been in touch with my doctor who is my gateway into the relevant mental health support agencies, and explained to my family that I will be taking whatever courses and actions are suggested.\n\n\nWe have discussed the controlling nature of our interactions with the children, we need to let them be children and show them what it means to live a good/virtuous life of meaning. Act like the parents we want to be and we will become those parents and and example our children want to follow.\n\n\nIt was humbling and difficult to be shown love and understanding that I don't feel I deserve. I cried as I spoke. I meant what I said. I will fight for my family and prove my love with my actions.\n\n\nI have spoken to the neighbours. Asked them for help, they have some experience with mental health agencies and told me how to access the resources I need. They have given me contacts to use.\n\n\nSome things were missed in the conversation [it was emotional so I just missed it] but I will pick this up again tonight when everyone gets back home. I need to make sure any future incident is reported to the police and I will ask my family and neighbours to do that. I also need to make sure K feels he can go to someone specific if he feels in danger, I need to have that conversation with the neighbours as well. Until I learn to control myself better I will leave the house to calm down if I need to - crucially before any shouting or anger rises.\n\n\nThank you all, for taking the time to read about this horrid incident. Thank you all for responding. Thanks you all for your help.",

The way you all manage issues needs some work so they don't escalate again.\n\n1. Seek out individual Anger Management. It has little to do with you hitting your son, but the fact that you say that anger has always been within you, you need to learn how to manage it so you don't overflow again. There are AA-like meetings in the US and abroad (unsure where you're located) through various groups - [this is one](http://emotionsanonymous.org/).\n\n1. When you have both of these set up, apologize and explain to him how you want to help yourself and your family. Apologizing now may not have an effect on him, but you can try; however, I think having the above two things in place will make your words have more meaning.\n\nGood luck.",

        "title": "Evidence-based Guidelines for Preventing Child Abuse: Spread the word",
        "content": "As an educator who deals with the mental health and social development of children, seeing the particularly horrific Iceland case in the headlines made me feel the need to make a thread to discuss how we as a society can truly address this enormous issue. The guidelines presented below were informed by the widely-acclaimed abuse prevention program of organization Darkness to Light as well as peer-reviewed studies by Cushman (2005), Andrzejewski (2006), Newberry (2007), Stronach (2008) and several others.\n\n\n\n=========\nChild Abuse\n=========\n\n\n\nChild sexual abuse is an extremely tricky problem to combat, largely because of the unparalleled level of emotion involved in cases and the secretive nature of the crimes. One of the biggest problems is that there are few concrete facts and definitions associated with the problem out there, so let's get a few basic ones out of the way first:\n\n1. A pedophile is someone who desires explicit sexual contact with pre-pubescent children. This is defined as physical contact with the breasts, buttocks or genitals (clothed or unclothed), oral contact with a child on any part of their body, and/or coercing a child to perform explicit sexual acts on themselves or someone else.\n    \n2. The \"bathing suit area\" refers to the area of a child's body that should always be deemed off-limits to the touches of others. The concrete rule must be: No physical contact between an adult and a child, or a child and another child, should involve the bathing suit area outside of a strict and supervised medical context.\n\n3. Most child sexual abuse is committed by people known by the child and their family. Parents, siblings, uncles/aunts and family friends are the most frequent perpetrators. \"Stranger Danger\" is a myth.\n\n4. \"Grooming\" is a term that refers to an older child or adult attempting to integrate themselves into a potential victim's life to facilitate an abusive scenario. It manifests as gift-giving, special favors, frequent unwanted touching, and continuous attempts to gain access to a specific child above and beyond what would normally be accepted. It does NOT refer to general gestures of friendliness towards a child or non-sexual, non-intimate physical contact UNLESS that contact is constant and causes the child distress.\n\n5. Secrecy is an enormous component of what allows these acts to go unreported. Pedophiles always seek to isolate their targets both physically and emotionally from their families and peers.\n\n\nThe solution, in my mind, is for both parents and educators to teach children in kindergarten the three R's:\n\n1. **Recognize** that no one can touch where their bathing suit covers.\n\n2. **Resist** anyone trying to touch them in that area. If it\u2019s an adult or an older child: run, kick, scream. If it\u2019s someone their age: call for an adult immediately.\n\n3. **Report** to a parent or teacher anything upsetting that they did, or were asked to do, with the absolute assurance that they will not face any negative consequences for sharing. They must be aware that this applies even if they promised to keep it \u201csecret.\u201d\n\n\nIn addition, children should be taught that it's always okay to kindly ask someone to stop touching them if they aren't comfortable with the touch. This empowers children by recognizing their ability to consent to touch they enjoy while rejecting touch that makes them uncomfortable.\n\n\nEqually important to combating this problem is emphasizing what sort of contact ISN'T a danger to children, and merely distracts us from the true threats. Just as we must enforce that the \"bad touches\" need to be reported and punished, we must also protect the legitimacy of \"good touches.\" A parent kissing their child on the lips should never be the cause of controversy, as it was in June's David Beckham fiasco. Nor should we allow male childcare workers to be profiled and attacked by parents and coworkers for consensual contact that isn't sexually explicit (hugs, tickles and touches outside of the bathing suit area, etc).\n\n\nGentle, silly, affectionate and nurturing physical contact between children and the adults around them is a very important part of their social and emotional development, and viewing them with reckless suspicion benefits no one. Even if we are uncomfortable with our children talking with strangers at the park, or engaging in consensual horseplay with a male teacher, we must recognize that these are minor personal issues with our own comfort and not actual threats to our children's safety.\n\n\nWith these concrete guidelines, the tactics abusers rely on will be far less reliable thanks to an informed child population and adults who evaluate actual threats more effectively.\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these topics and the guidelines presented? Have you implemented similar guidelines within your community? If not, how do you think you could work towards doing so?",

        "content": "Hey everyone. This is a throwaway account - I'm new to reddit regardless so I wasn't sure if this was the right place to share it, but anyway.\n\n\n\nI'm 21 years old and 4 months ago I moved out of my parents place into a lovely 3 bedroomed house with my 28 year old boyfriend. We've been together for just over 2 years. Between us both we had a lot of savings so we pretty much managed to decorate the house and get it perfect within the first month. \n\n\n\n\nMy boyfriend works full time and has a pretty good job, and I on the other hand am about to finish a degree in English language. I finish this degree in January, my classmates finished their degrees in June but the reason I am late is because I had to take a few months out of education due to mental health issues. For my entire life I've had some degree of mental health issue due to a borderline abusive upbringing thanks to my parents and I was also sexually abused by a cousin. I'm currently in therapy and for the past year it has worked wonders.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo 2 months ago we made the decision to start trying for a baby. I know people will think I'm young but I'm not here to validate my decisions to anyone (I also said this to my parents, ironically) We're financially stable and I always wanted my first child at a young age. It fits incredibly well with my finishing my degree in January too because I intend to take a year out to care for my baby and then develop a career using my degree after this.\n\n\n\n\nI found out I was pregnant last week. It was a massive shock because I was paranoid that it'd take me months or years to get pregnant. Clearly, it hasn't.\nWhen I saw the positive pregnancy test I couldn't have been happier, it was like no feeling I can explain. My boyfriend felt the same way. \n\n\n\n\n\nA week or so before I even found out that I was pregnant I had asked my mom if she'd like to be a grandma and her response was \"Well, I guess so.\" - Not too great of a response. My dads response was even worse, he told me not to bother having a child yet and he left it at that.\n\n\n\n\nSo as you can see I had to bite the bullet and just tell them when I found out. My moms initial reaction was 'you've got to be joking' which then moved on to 'I can't believe this' and then 'We're not sure if you're ready.' My dads response was far worse, he walked out of the room and hasn't spoken to me since I told him. My mom is also acting weird with me and sort of edges around me.\n\n\n\n\nTheir reactions have really upset me. I have more than enough experience with children, to which I'll explain now.\n\n\n\nMy parents had another child when I was 16, a little girl. My dad has always worked full time running a business so he was rarely ever at home and my mom started suffering post natal depression so the care of my baby sister was 100% on me. From the age of 16 I learned how to do everything for her and to this day I still see her as my own child.\n\n\n\n\nI do A LOT for my parents regarding my younger sister, whether that be taking her on days out or her sleeping over at my house twice a week - so it's utterly offensive that they have both made out that I would be a sh*t mother and that I know nothing. When I was a teenager I would have to cancel going out to see friends to look after my baby sister, but I never once felt resentful because I just loved/love her so damn much, caring for her full time however meant that I never had much of a social life.\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't know what to say anymore. I've been in tears writing this because everyone else is happy for us aside from my own parents. It's been this way my entire life, they have so little faith in me that it's unbelievable. \n\n\n\n\nPlease offer me advice.\n\n\n\nThank you.",

I know it's painful when your parents are not supportive so its time to turn your attention to healing from past hurt and focus on your baby and your younger sister/daughter. It's not easy but once you stop trying to get the response you want from them the less you will care.\nYou don't have to prove yourself to them or anyone.",

        "content": "Let me start with a little back story. My soon to be husband and myself have been fighting his ex girlfriend in a pretty nasty custody battle up until last December when final order came back. \n\nHis ex had accused him of sexually abusing his then 3 year old daughter. However, an investigation turned up that not only was there no proof, but the story had changed multiple times. DD (dear daughter) was subjected to a forensic interview and TWO play therapists. The first place therapist refused to treat her anymore and wrote in her report that she had \"serious concerns of mom pathologizing child.\" \n\nAfter DH (dear husband) had been cleared multiple times by many social workers, our DHS social worker wanted to pursue charges against mom for psychological abuse but could not because of lack of evidence. Come to find out that mom has been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder twice in her 24 years of life. \n\nWe hired a guardian en litum and halfway through his report, mom was accepted to Texas AM and announced her decision to move from Colorado to Corpus Christi with DD. Even though the guardian en litum recommended in his final report that DD should remain in this state with her father, the judge ruled she was allowed to move to Texas with her mother. \n\nWe received about 80 overnights a year and have DD right now for summer vacation and mom is responsible for all travel expenses. \n\nSince my DD has been with us, I have serious concerns for her metal health. She's an all around happy and good kid but she's incredibly manipulative,  just like her mother. All kids lie, but she lies randomly and for her own personal gain, A LOT. the other day she told me she likes getting hurt because it gets her attention. \n\nMy question is; How can we teach her that this is wrong in an age appropriate manner? I'm so concerned she's inherited her mother's mental illness.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Learning to be manipulative and borderline personality disorder are two different things.  Who knows, she may have issues with mental illness, but that will play out eventually.  Right now she needs to learn that she can actually trust you enough to be honest and forthright with you about her needs without resorting to manipulation.  My mother would lie just to get her way as easily as possible, and I was well into my 20s before I understood that this is not the way everyone is, and that it was damaging my relationships.  It is scary and hard to be upfront when you are unsure about how the other person will react.  Her mother's behavior has taught her that people are unpredictable, so she has to do whatever she can to protect herself and control the situation, including lying whenever it suits her.  \n\nYou help her by modeling honesty, honoring her feelings and needs when she is honest with you, and talking to her about how she can handle things differently when you do catch her in a lie.  \n\nIf you only have her for a fraction of the year, make the most of what you can teach her when she is with you.  It will help her learn that not everyone is like her mother, and trust and the truth will make her happier in the long run.",

        "content": "So this weekend was the first time I actually sat down my 7 and 8 year old daughters (separately) to discuss sex, because I came across some google searches that indicated they were curious. What a time to be alive. \n\nWe spoke a bit and the highlights were:\n\n* Sex may seem gross now but one day it won't be so we have to talk about it sometimes. It may seem weird and awkward to discuss with your mom but it's normal and important. (I may have also said \"sex sex sex sex sex sex sex! see it's not weird, it's okay to say and get used to,\" which resulted in some serious cringing on their part but oh well.) \n\n* Sex is something that people do when they love and respect each other\n\n* Every kid in the history of ever has been curious about this (I shared my own anecdote here) and all of the kids they know will be having some variation of this talk with their parents.\n\n* These kids will also be curious and may talk to them about it or even want to touch them but THEY are in control of their bodies and what they hear. They can say \"hey I don't want to talk about this,\" or \"Don't touch me,\" because they own their bodies and their space. \n\n* They should keep these conversations private for now because sex is a private thing and not something to discuss with everyone, particularly classmates.\n\n* Most importantly - no more googling because you're not going to get the answers you're looking for. Ask me and if needed we can google together. \n\n* EDIT - Also said sex is required to make babies\n\nNext steps:\n\n* Went buck on amazon and bought several books. They will have access to these books. We have mom and me journals that we write back and forth to each other in and I let them know that if they were scared to use their words to ask, they could write their questions and I would respond. I am debating the value of reading these books together (vs separately and then asking for questions).\n\n* Stressing the importance of having an adult (me or aunt) to speak to but to be sure that whatever adult they trust shares our views on sex (NOT grandma, as both have some seriously antiquated and shamey views).\n\nOne of the things that keeps coming up in my google searches for how to approach these conversations is to always use opportunities as they present themselves, so if you're watching a movie together that includes a sex scene, to pause and discuss. Umm what does that look like? Do I narrate the scene? Do I say ok they're having sex any questions cool now that I made this the worst moment of our days, let's resume? How does that conversation start and what does it look like? \n\nWhat has worked for you? My goal is to have young women (preferably age 17.5+) who enjoy sex without shame but protect themselves physically and emotionally. Oh and talk to their mom (or someone, but preferably me), about questions/birth control/general sexual and reproductive health concerns. Thoughts?\n\nShould we read these books together? Or should I let them read, marinate on the info, and then reconvene? \n\nAny suggestions for good resources? So far all I can find is super vague or unrealistic advice OR super preachy, mostly abstinence-focused advice.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "I personally ditched the \"sex is something people who love each other do\" mentality because I have seen it lead to some bad situations for teenagers. Too often people confuse a crush, lust and love and make decisions based on what they think they should do. I've tried to my best to make it clear that sex does not equal love and love does not mean you have to have sex. That someone who really cares about you will not pressure you to do anything you are uncomfortable with, and that you should only have sex when you feel ready and with a partner who is also ready, and that means not just liking somone, but being able to talk to each other about protection, birth control, likes and dislikes and boundaries. Just my two cents on that topic.",

        "content": "So, we\u2019ve had legal guardianship of our 7th grader for 2 school years now. He came to us from a level 3 placement in a group home which is one level below a prtf placement (secure). We had major issues transitioning him to the local mental health system and getting services in place through the school for his 504-behavior plan. We had to call the school board to even get the school to reopen it.\n\nHe was supposed to be placed in day treatment but was unable to be placed in day treatment initially because of Medicaid issues. It took nearly 2 years to get Medicaid fixed and transitioned to our locale. We finally got that taken care of and took it upon ourselves to get his evaluation done because it\u2019s now nearing the end of the year and we know the school will drag their feet in completing an internal evaluation.\n\nSo, for 2 full school years now he has NOT gotten day treatment or any of the other services he was supposed to get and his grades are suffering. His evaluation indicates that he is suffering from PTSD, bipolar disorder in partial remission, conduct disorder, sleep disorder, and gender dysphoria. (He identifies as a different gender at random or sexual orientation at random and was molested prior to going to a group home and while at the group home.)\nSo, I\u2019ve done the IEP thing before and the 504 behavior plans with other kids. It has NEVER been this difficult. I am afraid they are just going to pass him along to the next grade without addressing his academic issues. He\u2019s functioning at 4th grade level in math and can\u2019t keep up consistently.\n\nI\u2019ve never gotten this far without having things addressed. Has anyone had to do anything else to get the necessary services for a child in school. His psychiatrist feels an IEP would be more appropriate considering the effects severe trauma has had on his brain and his significant issues with math and his issues with story recall. (He often has trouble relating events correctly. His reality is not always consistent with everyone else, obviously not to the point of delusion, but to the point it affects his life.)\n\nWhat\u2019s the next step?\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas?\n\nEdited to format for reading ease.",

I don't say this because I think the school is bad or because you aren't working on making progress. I say this because the best way to make sure your child gets the full services he needs is to get an expert involved.  And honestly, if the school system is ready, willing and able to provide for his needs, a lawyer shouldn't cost an outrageous amount of money. And if the school system isn't ready, willing and able, you'll probably be able to recover at least the attorney's fees if you have to go to court.",

My father denies it totally, and my sister and I (and my mother) believe my father. Well, I think I do, but enough to leave him alone with my future children?\n\nBoth my aunt and uncle accuse him, but they both have a history of drug abuse, lying and low key mental health issues. They say it happened at a time when my father was dating my mother also.\n\nBoth my sister and I agree that we were never sexually abused at all growing up, I feel I have very strong memories of my childhood. But I do remember my parents were always openly sexual and I have memories from my childhood that looking back equates to a swinging lifestyle. We were always haphazardly shuffled away. \n\nMore recently, fixing my fathers computer, I have come across some rather unsavoury pornography, not child or minor related, that shocked me.\n\nI guess I'm looking for some guidance on how to bring up children around a grandparent that you don't completely trust. \n\nThe good news is that he is domestically incapable of looking after himself and cannot make toast or use a microwave. No disability, just a pampered male chauvinist. So he is way down te babysitting list for that reason anyway.",

If your child is interested in birth control, and you are supportive (and I truly hope you will consider being supportive), discuss long-acting reversible options(LARCs, like nexplanon, for example) that provide exceptional protection for several years. Cost for month-to-month options may increase and become inaccessible for young people. LARCs are also extremely effective because they eliminate user-error issues. \n\n2. Review your state's laws regarding things like emergency contraception. For example, where I live, it can be purchased without an ID or prescription \"in the aisle\" (we say \"in the aisle\" as opposed to \"over the counter\" because young people think \"over the counter\" means you have to go to the pharmacy counter) \n\n3. It is an unfortunate reality that many young people are terrified to speak to their parents about sexual health; if you can, please create spaces where these conversations are a normal part of your relationship. I work with teens on a daily basis around these issues. When they do not have resources, they will act in desperation: hide a pregnancy and seek no prenatal care, run away, or seek unsafe terminations.

        "content": "I am looking for advice from people who have had to inform grandparents that communication needs to stop between them.\n\nI have been divorced for about five years now. I have full custody but am allowing visitation between Mom and myself to be 50/50, so I have the ability to take him whenever I want. Because of the closeness my son has with his Mom and Grandparents, I don't intervene on visitation unless it is absolutely necessary.\n\nThe underlying problem is that the Mom has a history of lying, and the Grandma has a history of taking every situation and turning it into a negative. Mom and Grandparents have a rocky relationship - and that's putting it gently. I am often contacted by the Grandma about how Mom is essentially being a bad parent/not thinking of her child first.\n\nThe reason why I don't tell the grandparents to shove off is because they were with us when my son had a BMT that meant relocating halfway across the country for six months, so I have always given them the opportunity to contact me.\n\nMost recently, Grandma suggested that my son be evaluated for sexual abuse based on two specific things he's done. Mother pushed for it and I didn't want to be the person to come off as being in denial, so I OK'd it ... despite thinking that the signs weren't too alarming.\n\nLast Thursday, I get a call from the Grandma about how Mom has been naming people specifically who could be a suspect - as well as other situations on why she's a bad influence/parent. I reach out to Mom, and she denies it and is actually able to disprove some of Grandma's other accusations (remember, it's never *just one thing*). Between the two, I never know who has the right answer and normally in these situations, I just ignore it ... but with a situation this severe, I have to address it.\n\nSo, the assessment happens and it is determined that no abuse has happened (thankfully!). I'm now at a point that for the health of my relationship with my fiance, I need to tell the Grandma to no longer call me unless there are safety concerns that she has actual evidence of; otherwise, she will need to reach out to Mom. Because Mom and Grandma's relationship is terrible (as in, they have apparently yelled at each other in front of my child), I'm not expecting it to go well.\n\nSpeaking of my fiance, because of Grandma's history of venting about Mom to me, they is absolutely fed up with Grandma. She wants me to take action and completely cut her off. I can't do that, because if there is a safety concern related to Mom, I want to know about it. My solution is that Grandma can email, but no calls. However, she is so upset that this doesn't seem like an acceptable option. I completely understand where she's coming from, but to cut contact completely is something that I think could do more harm if something were to actually happen. \n\nSo, I'm looking for advice/tips/etc. on people who have had to do this ... or something similar. I often try to keep a diplomatic approach to try and keep both sides happy. But that's not happening here, I will essentially be telling Grandma to stop calling and to direct any issues with Mom.",

Pediatrician, National advice-only hotline, then child protective services, brief call to suspect only to tell her to cease all attempts to see us or contact us, and also went to police. Sincerely, thank you all for your comments and prayers.  It remains to be seen what the bureaucracy will do.  There is no physical evidence (exam revealed no tearing, bruising, etc.) and with the only accuser being age 2, all agencies consulted have made statements reflecting how little they will be able to do.  CPS said since I am preventing (abuser's) further access to the children, the case does not meet their guidelines for further action.  So all depends on law enforcement (they will refer to a special child unit that uses dolls and playtime to interview victims) and, of course, God. We will NEVER leave a child alone with this person for a second, not even in the next room.  We will call a local nonprofit counseling agency tomorrow morning.***\n\nI suspect my mom of repeatedly molesting my infant daughters.  It is entirely possible that I am crazy (it runs in the family) so I could be mistaken.  My list of suspicions is below. My questions are: Who do I call and what happens if I do?  Will my kids be taken away? Will my mom (my kids' only living grandparent) go to jail?  Would that make it better or worse for my kids, considering everyone would find out? What if she is innocent and my suspicious mind is about to ruin our family relationships?  Details:\n\n1) Today in the bathroom my 2 year old told my wife that her vagina \"hurts.\" She said, \"Grandma hurt me.\" My wife asked \"how?\" and my daughter answered by holding up a pointing finger, as if to say she was hurt in the vagina with a finger. My wife says she did not prompt her, but only asked, \"What's the matter?\"\n2) My 7 year old daughter was in the room and freaked the hell out, screaming, \"No she didn't!! I was there the whole time! She fell! She hurt her vagina when she fell!\" What the heck kind of reaction is that?  My instinct is that she was told to lie.\n3) We have frequently noticed that when grandma babysits, there will be diaper rash. Sometimes the vaginal area is red, raw, irritated-looking. On my older daughter, when she was a baby, one time her vagina opening was large, like someone had reamed it out with a finger or two.  My wife and I convinced ourselves we were crazy or mistaken and told no one.\n4) Older daughter lies about every little thing, even very trivial matters.\n5) Older daughter's emotions are always on edge. She cries, screams at us, and does not seem to act her age. Lies, sneaks and hides food, cries every single day between 2 and 5 times. Tantrums at age 7. Slams doors like a teenager.\n6) Older daughter once got very upset when we explained the private nature of her body and asked if anyone at school, Sunday school, or in the family had ever hurt her or touched her in a way that made her feel bad. She lost it and said that if we talked about that, then someone would come and take her away and make her live in a different house.\n7) For past 7 years we have dealt with our suspicions by telling ourselves that it is totally unbelievable that a woman would do that, that an elderly 67 year old woman would do that, that my mom would do that to anyone, especially to her own grandkids.  Considered moving out of state and not giving anyone our new address. Decided instead to prevent one-on-one time.  Grandma has exhibited a pattern of seeking out one-on-one time, volunteering for diaper duty and rushing away with the baby so that we have to follow her. She complains that we do not come over or let her babysit often enough. She repeatedly demands to be on the school's list of \"authorized to pick up child\" for the older one (she is not on the list).\n8) I walked in on an odd scene: grandma watching TV in bed, laying down, giving my then-5-year-old daughter a bouncey horsey ride directly on grandmother's crotch, while both laughed. If this was innocent, why did mom practically throw my daughter off of her when she saw me walk in?  On that weekend, mom asked to have my daughter spend the night in her room. She whined and manipulated and pleaded, making me say no four times.\n9) Our 2 year old has been crying a lot lately.  She eats almost nothing now and likes to find quiet corners where she can be alone. At mealtime she goes behind her bed and cries loudly for 10 minutes and won't answer any questions. That is why my wife asked her what was the matter today, because she seems to cry \"all day.\"\n10) Mom and I have never been emotionally close, but I have 10 good reasons to suspect that she is a closeted lesbian who had many female \"friends\" including a years long romantic and sexual relationship with her own first cousin. I am not equating homosexuality to pedophilia, merely noting that it is logical to me that my mom would be sexually interested in females.\n11) Another family member has told me a 2nd hand rumor that my mom was abused by my uncle when they were kids.  Supposedly my uncle repeatedly violated both his sisters, and my mom held down the little one so he could. And the little one cried and screamed for her mama, who never came and must have known and allowed it. I take that with a grain of salt because the story was told by the little one (my aunt) when she was 50 and in a mental health facility against her will.\n12) My 7 yr old has stated that no one loves her, no one likes her or listens to her, that it would be easier to be dead, and that she cannot wait to get out of here when she turns 18.\n\nWhat should I do?\nA) Confront mom? Maybe she is innocent and will convince me?\nB) Call the police?\nC) Call child protective services?\nD) Cut off all contact with mom?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all comments. Would also like to hear from anyone who has dealt with police or CPS on something similar.  Just read my state agency's website and am freaked out. They may determine that we \"failed to protect\" her. Also concerned a doctor may want an invasive exam, further injuring/traumatizing, while we standby by and tell the child to allow it. Damn. Feel like moving across the country and trying to forget.\n\nEdit2/update:  please see top of this original post for the conclusion. Thanks again, so so much!!",

        "content": "Social media is a staple in the lives of people around the globe.  It is how we connect with other people, get the latest information, and share our thoughts and feelings with other people.  We have become addicted to our technology, especially social media networks.  Before the 1970s, social networking was unheard of.  CompuServe was one of the first sites used to communicate with others outside of using email.  It was set up for business professionals to be able to share files and receive information on the latest news and events happening.  In the 1980s, it became a public domain where anyone could be a part of discussion boards and communicate with others.   By the 1990s, there was a huge leap in the use of technology.  Yahoo was created as an email and instant messaging site, Amazon was selling books, and companies were trying to get computers into every household possible.  The 2000s brought about the social media sites that we are most familiar with such as MySpace, LinkedIn, and Facebook.  Facebook started as a domain for Harvard students, but in 2006, it became a public domain and has grown to be the most widely used social media site in the world (Digital Trends Staff).  Social networking sites began as a way for adults to get in touch or keep in touch with their work place and friends.  Today, it is open to everyone and the primary users are children and teenagers.  The Pew Research Center found that seventy three percent of teens with the ability to be online are using social media sites (Lenhart 4).  Out of this large percentage, there are many teens that are facing the negative effects of the presence of social media.  Social media can be an efficient way to network and communicate as an adult, but children and teens face life long struggles by growing up in this technologically advanced age.  By looking at the many studies done on this subject we find that the overuse of social media can cause communication and social anxieties, low self-esteem from bullying, and an addiction to technology.  Parents need to be wary and children need to be informed of the negative effects that social media is having because they can cause lasting harm to the emotional and intellectual state of a young person.\n\tThe first negative effect from social media is the addiction to technology.  We are constantly bombarded with emails, text messages, and status updates that make us feel like we can\u2019t be away from our phones or computers for more than a few seconds.  Matt Richtel\u2019s article \u201cHooked on Technology, and Paying a Price\u201d states \u201cresearchers worry that constant digital stimulation like this creates attention problems for children with brains that are still developing, who already struggle to set priorities and resist impulses\u201d (Richtel 386).  Adults are better at handling this amount of information than children are.  They have had time to practice priority making and staying on task because many adults did not grow up with much of the technology available today.  Children will learn to rely heavily on the information they get and emotional ties they make through the Internet, and that can start problems such as short attention spans and social anxieties.  Being hooked on technology can also distance people from one another.  Richtel quotes Mr. Nass from Stanford saying, \u201cThe way we become more human is by paying attention to each other.  It shows how much you care\u201d (Richtel 387).  If children are brought up only befriending others through social media or other online avenues, they lose a sense of empathy and belonging that comes through in-person interaction.  Relying heavily on technology as the sole source of communication can stunt a child\u2019s intellectual and emotional growth. \n\tIt has been shown that adolescents that use technology as their main form of communication can develop social anxiety and fears of face-to-face communication.  A social anxiety will take effect when needing to communicate with others in person.  In more severe cases it could take effect at the thought of having to have a face-to-face conversation.  In her study about social anxieties, Tamyra Pierce said that the symptoms of this phobia can \u201coften include anxiety, depression and an overall uncomfortable feeling that influences one\u2019s ability to interact in social situations\u201d (Pierce 1.3).  This anxiety is often a result of being able to hide behind a computer for most of their communication.  Social media has given shy children and teens a way to stay away from excessive personal interaction in their everyday lives.  Pierce quotes another study on this subject in stating that \u201cfor socially anxious individuals, communicating with others on the Internet in a text-based manner may allow them to avoid aspects of social situations they fear while at the same time to partially meet their needs for interpersonal contact and relationship\u201d (Pierce 1.3).  This could be viewed as a positive aspect of social media because it is giving them a way to communicate where they were not able to before, but if an individual does not face their fear then they will struggle with it for the rest of their lives.    \n\tSocial media sites have created a sense of belonging in adolescents due to the friendships they have made on the Internet.  If they have a social anxiety, adolescents are likely to find refuge in these friendships because they can make them without any actual contact.  Researchers have made an effort to focus their studies on the changing nature of friendship due to technology.  In the article \u201cAntisocial Networking\u201d, the author, Hilary Stout, dives into the question of whether social media is strengthening friendships or \u201cwhether the quality of their interactions is being diminished without the intimacy and emotional give and take of regular, extended face-to-face time\u201d (Stout).  There is evidence that the ease of use of technology is taking away the need for close personal relationships.  Friendships can teach a child a lot about how to interact with other and be a part of society.  Technology is taking away that ability by keeping children from interacting with people their own age and otherwise.  Professor Parker of the University of Alabama is quoted in the article in saying that close friendships \u201care essential to allowing kids to develop poise and allowing kids to play with their emotions, express emotions, all the functions of support that go with adult relationships\u201d (Stout).  Children are able to learn abilities that will benefit them throughout their lives.  The ability to deal with emotions, for example, goes hand-in-hand with dealing with cyber-bullying and low self-esteem.  These problems are mostly seen in the teenage years when emotions and hormones control our thoughts and feelings.  If children can learn how to deal with these emotions, then they can decrease the emotional and physical risks that come with these issues.  The friendships found online cannot prepare children and teens for the interactions they will face everyday of their lives.  We need human interaction to be able to take part in what society has to offer us. \nLow self-esteem is a problem that almost everyone faces, especially as teenagers.  Social media is playing a large part in this since its popularity has increased over the past few years.  People are constantly posting pictures and statuses in the hope that others will like and give positive feedback on them.  There was a study published in the CyberPsychology and Behavior journal about the relationship between friend networking sites and adolescents\u2019 self-esteem.  They produced and distributed a survey about the subjects\u2019 use of social media and how it affects their feeling about themselves.  Their results concluded that \u201cadolescents\u2019 self-esteem was affected solely by the tone of the feedback that adolescents received on their profiles: Positive feedback enhanced adolescents\u2019 self-esteem, and negative feedback decreased their self-esteem\u201d (Vulkenburg 589).  There are two sides to this coin: social media can be a positive influence on those who use it, but they can become addicted to the positive feedback.  They post more pictures and statuses craving the positive comments that they received previously.  As soon as they receive one harmful comment their self-esteem plummets again.  Adolescents are basing their self-worth on the opinions of others and it can be detrimental to their emotional health.  The lack of self-esteem can also cause children, particularly young girls, to fall prey to sexual predators.  There are countless accounts of an unknown person paying attention to and complimenting young people in the hope that they can lure them into a trap.  The young person will plan to meet this unknown predator and be kidnapped and never seen again.  Self-esteem can determine how a person thinks and acts.  We should not take lightly the threat that social media poses to the emotional side of a child or teen. \nSocial media has made it easier for people to be anonymously hurtful to each other.  People that take part in this are commonly called trolls.  Jaron Lanier, in his article \u201cTrolls\u201d, describes a troll as \u201ca term for an anonymous person who is abusive in an online environment\u201d (Lanier 371).  These people can cause serious harm to those that they target with their insults and aggressive comments.  The Pew Research Center found that \u201c88% of American teens have witnessed cruelty on social networks, and 13% have felt nervous about going to school the next day because of something that happened online\u201d (Dickey 43).  Cyber-bullying happens all of the time and not many people realize the effect it is having on children and teens.  This doesn\u2019t only happen between adolescents.  There are adults that get involved with causing harm to the younger generation.  In the article, Lanier mentioned a story where a woman created a fake account as a younger boy to get close to and finally break the heart of one of her daughter\u2019s peers.  This situation caused the young girl with the broken heart to commit suicide (Lanier 372).  There are stories everywhere of people who have been bullied on the Internet that end their lives because they feel as if they have nowhere else to turn.  Social media sites have made it very easy to harm others without anyone knowing exactly who you are.  Limited information is needed to start a profile on many sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.  It is very easy to fake the information you give and to change it whenever you please.  Anonymity can be a good way to give an honest opinion about something without consequence, but it becomes a problem when the intent of those opinions is to hurt someone else. \nAs social media is becoming more popular, there needs to be a way of communicating the risks that are involved.  One study that has been done uses the school system to educate students in a classroom setting.  There are three main risks to social networking sites: content risks, contact risks, and commercial risks.  For the study, they made up packages of information pertaining to each of the risk areas.  The researchers distributed them to schools and had the educators use the packages in class to see if implementing the information into the school system will have any effect on the attitude and behavior toward social media.  The students were given a pre- and post-test to observe if their behavior and attitude toward the risks changed.  The results showed that there was increased awareness, but it had little effect on what the students did with the information (Vanderhoven 124-129).  The study has shown that there are possibilities at increasing awareness of the negatives of social media.  This information can be even more effective if brought to attention in every facet of everyday life.  Some ways could include media coverage, education in schools, and parental guidance on the issue.  Parents also need to be aware of the risks involved in letting their children interact online.  They might have a stronger influence on children than an educator can.  This study is only one of the ways that children can be exposed to the true nature of social media.  With a constant reminder we may be able to see a change in the apathetic attitude of children and teens in today\u2019s society.\nTechnology was created to help us do things were we previously unable to do.  Even social media has helped to break boundaries with communication, but it has come at a price.  Social media has caused children and teens to become addicted to their technology, develop social anxieties, and feel uncomfortable with who they are or how they look.  Technology is changing the way friendships are made and maintained.  The relationships made on social networking sites can be dangerous and unhealthy to those who use it as their only way of feeling like they belong. There are many studies on this subject because it is very important with the growing amount and popularity of technology and social media.  Parents and their children need to be made aware of the dangers of becoming too involved in their online profiles because it can cause lasting damage in a child\u2019s life.  Social media is usually portrayed by society as a sign that you are with the times, but children and teens need to be made aware that a high status in society is not as important as their emotional, intellectual, and physical well-being.          \n\nWorks Cited\nDickey, Jack. \"The Antisocial Network.\" Time 184.1 (2014): 40-45.

        "content": "So my very bright, very reckless and emotionally disturbed daughter has had sex at the very young age of 14.  I won't get too much into the background story, it is actually upsetting.  It should be established though that we can not trust her to look after herself and be responsible for her own sexuality.  We also can not trust her to be honest with us.\n\nWith the above being true, I do not think condoms or pills would be enough to let me have piece of mind.  Obviously, she should use condoms to prevent STDs, but we (wife & I) want to put her on something like Depo, implants or an IUD so we do not have to worry about her not taking it.  I've read some bad things about Depo, weight gain and bone calcium loss.  My daughter is pretty dead set against getting an implant in her arm; though I think this may be her best option.  That leaves IUDs as the choice that is left. \n\nI am going to be taking her to Planned Parenthood next week to get her checked out and to do an initial birth control consultation.  I know the IUD insertion could potentially be painful for a teen.  Has anybody had a relatively young teenage daughter get one?  How did it go?\n\nAnother thing that I'm concern about is that places like PP tend to want to protect teen girls from their parents, but as I mentioned before, my daughter is reckless and may not make the right choices on her own.  She really needs to be on a type of fix-it and forget-it birth control.  I feel like I need to explain the situation to the doctor ahead of time -- I'm not  sure if PP will do that for us.\n\n**Edit**\n\nI should have put in my original post that she has mental health issues, is bulimic and has wild mood swings.  She will self-harm when down.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "PP would be your best bet, they are there for this exact reasons. They might even explain to you how you could make the pill work.

        "content": "A little back story first. I'm twenty-five years old and my sister, Lizzie, is ten. I work shift work and often on my days off, she stays at my place (probably a third of the time). Our mom is not in good health mentally or physically, and it is taking a toll on Lizzie. We've always been great friends, and each other's confidants. I try to be a positive and supportive influence in her life because I know that I could have used someone like that when I was in her shoes. In other words, I'm in a bit of a parental role a lot of the time.\n\nSo anyways, my ten year old sister Lizzie recently started sex-ed in school. While what the kids are learning in the classroom is important and useful information for them, the conversations the kids are having amongst themselves aren't so appropriate.\n\nMy sister is suddenly aware of the concept of porn, different sex acts, sex toys and probably masturbation thanks to what other kids have told her.\n\nI probably didn't handle things very well initially. Out of the blue, she asked me if my girlfriend gave me blow jobs. I panicked, stalled, got all flustered, and said we'd talk about things later. I don't really want my kid sister knowing what my girlfriend does or doesn't do because I'm not sure how to teach her in what context something like a blowjob is appropriate. My girlfriend is obviously someone she idolizes a fair bit, but I don't want my ten year old sister to instantly think that what a 23 year old women in a heathly relationship does is what is right for her out of the gate. Also, I don't even want to think about my baby sister ever doing anything like that ever. Double standard, I know.\n\nI grew up with a fairly conservative view on sex, and suffered for it until I got over some of my hang ups. However, I also feel I gained a good value system regarding sex. As an influential person in her life, and someone she feels comfortable asking these kinds of questions, I really don't want to let her down. These are very uncomfortable topics to have with my little sister though, and I just don't know how to teach her the rights and wrongs of the birds and the bees, especially when she's still only ten! I'm not even sure, being a guy, if I should be the one giving her advice on these matters, but I'd still prefer she hear the right thing from the wrong person, than just pass her off to someone else who might get it wrong.\n\nI'd like for Lizzie to have a healthier view on sex than I did, but also share my values that there is a proper time and place for it.\n\nI could really use some advice on these matters.\n\nFear not, Reddit is not the only place I'll be asking for advice.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThanks for all the advice, it helped. We sat down and had a talk. Turns out Lizzie was more intimidated than anything else by all that she'd heard. I didn't have to go too in depth into too much, she talked enough for the both of us. Some of her friends are under the impression that girls are obligated or expected to do this or that regarding sex and sexuality. She knew better, but I guess she wanted some affirmation and clearity. I think she actually wanted a guy's perspective, since a lot of her anxiety was about what boys expected. I mostly just let her talk though and she pretty much hit all the key points. It was good, I think I panicked over nothing.",

It was my step father. He never touched me since and I never allowed myself to be a position to be violated again. I was probably 11 to 13 when the abuse happened. My concern is how do I handle the interaction between him and my daughter. I don't want her to experience what I did. I don't want to excise him from my life. He is remorseful of what happened but we have never had a discussion about what happened. I am thinking of having lunch with him and telling him that in no uncertain terms if what happened to me ever happens to her I will fucking destroy him. What can I do to help ensure it doesn't happen. My mother doesn't know and will not find out from me. Should it be that I tell her I don't want him alone with him because of his health issues (he has an illness that makes him weak and has also had some memory loss). I logically know nothing may happen for years (my kid is under a year old) but I want this resolved before she reaches his preferred age.

        "most_upvoted_comment": ">he has an illness that makes him weak and has also had some memory loss.\n\nThis doesn't make things safer, it actually makes things far more dangerous where your child is concerned.  As people lose memory, they often also lose their inhibitions.  You can't even trust that he'll stick to his \"preferred age\".\n\nI don't think you should allow your daughter to be alone with him at any age.  If he is anywhere nearby, keep your daughter close and discourage contact with him.  Minimize family visits.\n\nBy all means, do have that chat with him and let him know that he won't be allowed anywhere near her at any age.  But don't expect that he'll either remember or abide by your wishes.\n\nI know you want to protect your mother, but the time may have come when you need to be an adult and tell her the truth.",

It's natural for a teen to want to do adult things, I was doing the same when I was  younger than her. Thankfully, her and her boyfriend used protection, and she came to me wanting to get on birth control. I was shocked, but I knew the day was coming, so I swallowed all of the things I wanted to say and made her an appointment at our local health department. \n\nI explained to her that she was going to get a physical done and they were going to ask her about her sexual history and all of that stuff. I told her it was nothing to worry about and she could ask any questions she wanted to.\n\nThursday was when the appointment came around. We went, and waited well over an hour before they called her back. She wanted me to go with her, but the nurse would not allow it. It pissed me off, to say the least, but I bit my tongue and waited. \n\nShe was in the back for well over an hour. When she came out, she was crying. Very very upset. Mama bear mode activated. I kept asking her what was wrong, but she never told me. I know how my daughter is so I stopped pushing the subject, I just had to wait it out.\n\nWell, about two hours ago, she came in to my room and told me what had happened.\n\nWhile she was in the back, they checked her height, her weight, her blood pressure. Normal routine stuff. Then they told her to undress and do the little flimsy gown crap everyone hates so much. She waited & the doctor came back. Explained to her what exactly a physical was and checked her breasts for lumps. She said the doctor pinched her nipple and was really rough while doing the breast exam. \n\nThen we get to the actual physical. Now, my daughter was born at 24 weeks gestation. Her \"lady bits\" pretty much developed under a heat lamp, so ever since she started puberty, she's been discharging. We've gone to  3 different doctors and she's been on several different medications and antibiotics. It just doesn't go away. She understands why her body does this. It's just her vagina cleaning itself, basically. I never had much discharge until after I had my second daughter. It's just how a woman's body works sometimes.\n\nWell, the doctor was rough with her. Made her bleed after the physical and told her that her cervix was red and irritated and that her discharge was a sign of being unclean.  This bitch of a doctor also told my daughter this was a sign of chlamydia. The doctor did send her back for blood work and told her in two weeks, she'd know the results. But, she gave my daughter a shot in her hip and made her take two pills *just in case* she does have this STI. \n\nI. Was. So. Pissed.\n\nI asked my daughter why didn't she speak up. She said every time she tried, the doctor would cut her off and make her feel bad. Like the doctor was telling her that she was wrong because she knew more about her body than this old hag who spent five minutes poking and prodding my daughter's cervix with a giant q-tip. No fucking wonder it was red and irritated. \n\nI called and complained, heavily. I fear that my daughter was traumatized by this. She said she no longer feels comfortable about her body. It breaks my heart because my daughter's always been a little sassy girl who shines with confidence. \n\n\nHow can I help her? Is therapy an option? What else can I do to make sure this doctor doesn't do this to other girls? I'm so angry, just by retyping this. It hurts my heart to know my daughter was trying to protect herself and in the end only got screwed over. I plan on calling my doctor Monday morning to see if she can be seen by her, I feel stupid by not already trying that, but I figured my daughter wouldn't want to go to the same gyno as her mother.

        "title": "Major Freak Out:  My Mentally Disabled Sister May Be Pregnant",
        "content": "Okay, so where to begin?  Well, I have a mentally disabled sister who will be turning 18 later this summer.  (She's a good decade + younger than me.)  Her \"label\" is technically \"MR\" (mentally retarded), although she can function at a high level and her maturity is equal to that of an 8-10 year old.\n\nAnyway, I found out I was pregnant last year and I'm due in a few weeks.  For some unknown reason, she had a major meltdown over the news and said she was going to \"go get knocked up\" too.  We took it with a grain of salt and boiled it all down to her thinking it would get her attention...which it did for a short while.    \n\nNow, for a little bit of back history before I continue:  She had been on the depo shot for a few years since she was unable to cope with having menstrual cycles.  She has pretty poor hygiene and is always battling UTIs and vaginal infections because she simply doesn't understand she needs to take very good care of that area...even though my Mom has showed her a thousand times what to do.  She also got in \"trouble\" with my Mom for having sex with another mentally challenged boy in the bathroom after school.  Nothing came of the situation, but my Mom knew she needed to keep a better eye on her.  One of my sister's friends, who doesn't have a mental disability, but who is still very, VERY immature has apparently been covering for my sister so she can go out and have sex with random guys.  (I believe under the guise that they're going shopping or having sleepovers, etc.)  This has just recently come to light and it seems as though it may be a little too late.\n\nAnyway, there was a change in my sister's insurance recently and she was unable to get her depo shot for a 3-4 month period.  Meanwhile, she apparently started sleeping with random guys and older men she's been \"meeting\" online.  I am very much disgusted and saddened by this, but she really doesn't realize the consequences of her actions.  She has low self-esteem due to her disability and excessive weight issues and I feel she has started compensating by offering her body to men for the attention she so desperately craves.  \n\nWhile I thought we had moved past her little freak out when we first announced my pregnancy, apparently things have taken a turn because a family member told her she needed to get used to not getting as much attention since there will be a new \"baby\" in the family.  This did not go over well with her, of course.  She knows the mechanics of how you get pregnant, but she certainly doesn't realize the consequences.  I also think the whole situation is propelled more by sexual gratification than actually trying to get pregnant.\n\nSo, she's currently at the doctor's office trying to sort things out.  She's going for STD testing in addition to the pregnancy test and I'm sitting here getting ready to faint/puke.  There's no way she can take care of a child because she simply cannot take care of herself.  I spoke with her briefly about the situation and she seems to think she can simply give the baby to one of her friends if they do find she is pregnant.  Completely unrealistic ideas...  I talked with her about abortion and she seemed to understand the concept and why it might be beneficial given her situation, but I fear my parents won't consent due to religious convictions.  I also don't know if she could realistically carry a child to term without killing either herself or the baby because she is in terrible health.  She is 5'2\" and weighs around 275 pounds and has hypertension, pre-diabetes and back problems due to her weight.  She clearly cannot take care of herself physically and all the attempts my parents have made to rectify and/or modify her unhealthy behaviors have failed.  You could tell her 100 times why eating certain foods are bad and then help her make good choices, but she'll literally throw a tantrum like a three year old and sometimes get violent when she doesn't get her way.  \n\nOkay, so enough babbling.  I'm just at a loss.  From what I understand, it's likely that she *at least* has an STD or two.  That's not the end of the world.  But a baby?  I have no idea what to say.  I don't think she's in a position to carry the baby to term - in both a physical and mental capacity - but I have no idea how to get through to her (and possibly my parents) that bringing a baby into the mix would spell catastrophe for all involved.  I also feel guilty, although I know none of this is my fault.  She's always been jealous of me because I'm \"perfect\" and no matter how much I try to reason with her that we're simply \"different,\" it doesn't get through.  I'm sad and upset for her.  I'm disgusted other guys and men would take advantage of someone disabled.  It's just a crapshoot at this point.  If anyone has any advice or opinions, I'm all ears.\n\nTL;DR:  My sister is a mentally disabled minor (17) who may be pregnant.  I feel guilty because she's upset about my pregnancy and I'm at a loss for what to do if she is pregnant.  She cannot take care of herself, let alone a child.  Advice and opinions needed.\n\n**EDIT**:  I just spoke with my sister.  Fortunately, the pregnancy test came back negative.  However, the doctor is pretty sure she has chlamydia and isn't awaiting test results to start her on treatment.  There is also a decent chance that she's contracted genital herpes and they are waiting for the results.  Unfortunately, she has also been referred to an outside clinic for HIV testing.  It's come to light that she's had sex with over 10+ guys/\"men\" in the last few months.  My Mom and doctor are discussing long-term contraception for the future, but that obviously doesn't help with the STDs she's contracting and likely spreading.  My parents will be visiting this weekend and I am going to speak to them about arranging outside authorities to take over her care once she turns 18.  If they are unwilling to consider these options, I may very well get in contact with social services myself.  Any advice on this process is appreciated.  \n\n**EDIT 2**:  Holy cow!  Thanks for all the support.  I'm trying to reply to as many as comments as possible, but bear with me...there are a lot.  Talking through things has really helped me come to terms with the fact I absolutely need to get in contact with social services to work out something for her future long-term care.\n\n**FINAL UPDATE**:  I spoke with my parents earlier this morning and here's where we are.  I was able to look through her Facebook messages (after piecing some information together with my parents - btw, they're both in the know at this point) and have found the ring leader in all of it.  Apparently, she somehow got in contact with a 22/23 year old guy who was just released from jail at the beginning of the month.  He convinced her to have sex with him (and according to her, three other guys - although there is no evidence to support that specific claim) and he admits (he's obviously not very bright to post this out in the open on Facebook) he was trying to get her pregnant because he wants another child.  He's basically put the last nail in his coffin because he admits knowing her age, yet still made very specific and explicit plans to have sex with her...he even admits to the act itself!  This is sick and probably TMI, but there is physical evidence as well.  He apparently gave her his shirt...which he, um, masturbated into after they had sex the first time.  Anyway, I took screenshots of the entire conversation - over 225 messages long - off of his Facebook wall and will be sending it to the police once my Dad contacts them.  \n\nSurprisingly, my parents were very receptive to the idea of **further** involving social services in the future and they have asked that I find some resources and avenues for them to turn to over the next few months.  In the meantime, my sister is on complete lockdown and is not allowed to go anywhere besides school.  Her school counselor is aware of the situation and she will be escorted absolutely everywhere - even the bathroom - from now on to ensure she has someone monitoring her every move.  It sounds harsh, but that's what she needs.  As far as the contraception is concerned, my parents are seriously considering Mirena for its longevity.  We should know the results of her STD tests (herpes, HIV) by the end of the week.  She has started treatment for chlamydia.\n\nI really want to thank everyone for their outpouring of support.  You have helped me through a very tough 24 hours and have given me lots to think about, as well as offered up tons of excellent advice.  You all rock!",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "It might be time to get social services involved. They can help, not only with the insurance, but also with making sure that your sister is properly supervised and instructed on how to be healthy.\n\nDo your parents have a plan for when she's out of school? How will she be cared for? Does she have access to assistance programs that can get her out of the house for at least a little bit every day for social interaction and job training? Usually, unless the impairment is such that she's incapable of following simple instructions or learning a very basic job (bagging, stocking, mopping, etc), there are programmes to help her learn how to live at least partially on her own.\n\nDoes she go to a normal public school, or a special school? Why was she left to her own devices for long enough to have sex in the bathroom? If she's that incapable of making good decisions, then she needs to be supervised at all times.\n\nI'll admit, hearing that she has tantrums and poor hygene worries me. If she's severely disabled enough that she's incapable, then it's likely that your parents are not able to care for her. If she's not that severely disabled, then she has been spoiled due to her disability, and that needs to be handled.\n\nPlease keep us updated, and I hope your family gets some help with her.",

        "content": "My daughter just turned 5, and is in kindergarten.  The other day when I was picking her up from school, she told me that a boy in her class told her that he was \"falling in love\" with her.  I had to clarify that those were his exact words, and she said yes.\n\nToday she came out and after doing our standard greeting, she said, \"GUESS WHAT?  [same boy] KISSED ME TODAY!\"  I looked at her and asked if she kissed him or if he kissed her, and she said that he kissed her.  I asked if it was on the cheek, and she said it was on the lips.  I asked if any teachers saw and she said no, that no one was looking.  She wasn't distressed by it, and mentioned that now he was going to be her boyfriend, and seemed quite happy.\n\nNow, I'm torn.  Part of me thinks it's cute, but a larger part of me thinking it's inappropriate.  I volunteer in her classroom a lot and am quite comfortable with the teachers (and I feel they are with me, as well), and when I brought up the 'falling in love' comment, her teacher mentioned that she doesn't like how some of the kids act, but didn't say anything about my daughter.  I told her today after my daughter told me about the kiss, and her teacher said she was very glad I told her and that she was going to have a boundary / relationship-type talk with the kids as part of a sexual type health unit, and was going to pull the boy aside separately and talk to him about how it's not appropriate to kiss other kids on the lips.\n\nI'm just not sure if I'm handling or responding to this in the right way.  I'm not outraged, but it does weird me out, but I also think it's cute at the same time.  \n\nDoes anyone have any experience with this kind of thing?

        "content": "Now I should add a disclaimer that I am not myself a parent, but before this turns you off to what I have to say, these are some details about where I'm coming from. Yes, I am only still a \"young adult\" and I have plenty I could learn and look forward to anything experienced parents have to say. I am currently studying both Elementary school and High school education, so I do have experience working with teenagers in such a setting (and other ages and other settings), and I have had plenty of studying in social and psychological aspects (Not saying I'm an expert, certainly, but I do at the very least know some things), and I am generally interested in social and psychological studies outside my coursework. As well I stick into contact with many teenagers on some subjects, both online, and real life, sometimes friends, sometimes just people to talk to, so I've been told current perspectives as well, and here are some things I've picked up as I've heard \"horror stories\" (I use the term lightly of course) And I do not accuse anyone here of going against these, they are just common things I hear and observe\n\n**1. Don't assume you know how they feel**\nNow I get it, we've been teenagers, we know a lot of things that teenagers go through. And yes, you can have a lot of good things to say about the topic and what it was like when you went through it, you can offer perspective. But remember you are *not* them, they are a different person, with a different perspective, different time, and different emotions, and the situation may not be exactly the same. Seek to understand them and listen, not throw a bunch of \"expertise\" at them.\n\n**2. Trying to explain is not \"talking back\"**\nThis is a favorite one I see, and I see teachers do it as well. A teenager did something they weren't supposed to, or didn't do something they were supposed to and all they get is a scolding. The instant they try to give any explanation it's \"Don't talk back to me.\" And it pains me to see these kids discredited and given no chance to speak. Didn't this bother you? Let the kids say something. I understand it may be a case where they're just giving some lame excuse, but too often I believe the kids sincerely have a reason, and they have no chance to say it, they have no chance to defend themselves, and it seems like the only reason is the adult doesn't want to be wrong. Which leads me to...\n\n**3. Pointing out you're wrong about something or you're handling something badly is also not \"talking back.\"**\n\nThis one is really kind of simple. If a kid is simply pointing out that you're wrong about something, or they think you're handling something badly, instead of yelling at them for talking back, why not *fess up to it* and think about what they're saying. Just admit you're wrong if you're wrong (And I say this because if they're just saying you're wrong just to try to be right, then discipline is needed) and if they think you're handling something badly, don't discredit them. Just cause they're younger than you doesn't mean they don't have anything good to say, actually analyze what you're doing.\n\n**4. Don't assume they're problems aren't \"real problems\"**\n\nI look back at high school and think \"Wow, some of the things that happened were just dumb. Why was x person even mad about that? Why did I even do that?\" There are those things. Overly serious about some relationship, or getting mad because so-and-so didn't do such and such they're are moments like that. But that doesn't mean there aren't serious problems in high school. Friends are serious, don't discredit high school friendships, peers have been proven to be some of the most influential parts of someone's life both later on and psychologically at the time. And if there's problems with friends *they could be serious problems* and even if the problems seem silly to you, it's very real to them. We've all heard the horror stories of teenagers committing or attempting suicide, and those are some reasons, no one takes them seriously, and it's very sad to see. And likewise, if a your kid is worried about something psychologically, don't assume it's \"just because they're a teenager\" and don't try to pull the whole \"You're just different, I swear *everyone* has a mental disorder nowadays\" or \"it's just teenager angst\" or \"Mental health professionals just want to diagnose you to get money\" No, no, and no. Are there cases where those things can be true? Sure, but take they're concern seriously. Mental health problems are a very real thing and these students, because of people like this discrediting them [aren't getting the help they need](https://sites.google.com/a/namilee.org/national-alliance-on-mental-illness-of-lee-county-nami-/mental-illness/facts-and-myths)\n\n**5. Don't assume you know what they're going through**\n\nI know this is kind of like #1, but there are some differences. There I talked about how they feel and such, but it goes a lot deeper than that. You may know plenty about some common situations, but I can almost guarantee that you do *not* know what they're going through, and this is something I will speak of from personal experience.\nBecause I have been hiding so much from my parents my whole life, and I'm 90% sure they wouldn't know what it's like to be like any of it. And if you doubt me, you are talking to someone who has been hiding [this(non-sexual) interest(NSFW)](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABDL/) from family for about 20 years (starting from the first emergence of the interest) and I also grew up in a Christian family, so naturally I had to hide that I'm bi, I had to suppress or hide any interest in the same gender. I've had attachment issues with my family, I was not properly diagnosed with Asperger's as a child and hid any self-harm or contemplations of suicide because I knew my mom would just insist \"You're just different, nothing's wrong\" and \"If you just work harder at things you'll be happier\" \"It's just teenage angst\" \"You just need to improve this\" and these are not exaggerations, these are actual things said to my sister when she tried to convince me my to get her diagnosed for depression (which she later did do against my mom's will and is much better). So I know what it's like, I know what it's like to hide, to go through things and never being sought to understand, just be discredited, and to hear that lie of \"I know exactly what you're going through.\" Don't assume, seek to understand, because I'd hate to see a child end up like I did in high school, and I thank any of you that has been careful with these things.\n\nTL;DR Don't assume you know everything, let you teen speak, and take them seriously.\n\nI welcome any discussion or thoughts on these things, please add, constructively criticize, whatever, or if you wish, ask me anything about myself that I mentioned in here, I'm willing to explain further on any of those topics :)",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Very insightful.  I agree as a parent.  It is difficult to actually follow through on your advice because our own fears take hold, and we focus on our inability to change our child's emotions with some particular strategy.  We want most to keep our children happy to be in the world, because after all we brought them in.  When they question their existence, it is hard to handle.  After all we made sure they had what they needed and more.  Depression, and watching your child deteriorate is very anxiety provoking for the parent, which consequently reaches the child in a most harmful way ... in words that are said and actions that may be taken.  Parents cannot do it alone, seek help from a competent therapist.... which by the way does not take insurance.",

They don't ever cover masturbation or relationship issues. \n\nParents are the reliable source for children and they deserve for us to be educated on the things they might encounter in life. Passive parenting doesn't cut it so step it up! Go to your kid(s) and discuss what they see in school, about holding hands; that its okay to have a crush on someone, and if they are ready to know - about sex.

        "content": "What a difference a month makes: Things got better.\n  \n[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/puhhl/becoming_a_parent_has_ruined_my_life/)\n  \nAlmost immediately after my previous posting, things started to improve. This was a combination of making a few changes, and the baby turning a corner. \n  \nPreviously, I talked about how everything I'd once valued in my life had pretty much turned to garbage, and I figure I should do a bit to review what changed and how things improved. \n  \n**My social life:** *just fine*. My wife was not into the idea of giving each other \"days off\", as some posters had recommended, but we did figure out a system. My wife and baby go to bed very early, and, if I go out on a Saturday night, so long as I get back reasonably early on Sunday morning, my absence is hardly noticed. The key factor in this is that caring for the baby has gotten much less strenuous. I can go to a friends house for the night, and have confidence that my wife and child are having a fine time without me. \n  \n**My sex life:** *revived*. Not long after my last post, my wife and I adopted a strategy where we agreed that we weren't even going to try to have sex for 2 weeks. This was far less frustrating than the cycle of failed attempts and disappointment. Looking back, there was certainly an element of sheer sexual frustration, but what I really missed was the intimacy. One problem, aside from the exhaustion, was that we'd both sort of withdrawn emotionally. We'd basically become co-workers, and we were both so stressed out and preoccupied, it was like we'd hardly seen each other. Eventually we put out brave faces aside and had sort of a postmortem on the first three months. Once we'd gotten some things off of our chests and emotionally reconnected, and ever since the two weeks were *almost* up, it's been all lovey dovey. \n\n**My finances:** *improving*. I've still got my day job, but I've started a side venture which should start to bring in some extra money by the summer, and I've taken a bit of contract work. There's still much work to be done, but I'm pretty sure I'll be able to stay in the black.\n  \n**My health:** *eh, still surviving*. The baby is sleeping much better, but I'm still burning the candle at both ends. But, not being so stressed out, I'm not feeling quite so run down as before. \n  \n**My career:** *improving*. I'm not breaking any productivity records, but I'm feeling a lot better about the amount of work I've been getting done. \n  \nSome little things have helped, but the main thing that's changed is the baby. None of the good stuff that's happened would've been possible if he hadn't drastically reduced his demands on our time and energy. For instance, he used to need to be walked and/or bounced almost constantly. Now you can set him down for 15 minutes at a time, and he'll just sit there jabbering to himself. It's adorable. Also, he hasn't been going into \"inconsolable mode\" as often or as severely. There were times before where, no matter what you did, the best you could do was to get him to cry less hard, and futilely trying to console a child is just soul crushing. We'd get stuck in these epic struggles trying to get him to fall asleep, and after an hour or two of that, we'd be just psychically and emotionally worked. Even better is that we've learned a couple ways to make him laugh, and it's a blast. We'll have half an hour of laughing and playing with the baby, and it's wonderful. Overall, caring for him is more fun and less strenuous, and that makes all the difference.\n  \nThanks again for all the advice and encouragement from before. I just wanted to let everyone know that things did indeed get better. \n  \n~All the best to you and yours~",

        "content": "I saw the post for the 'Kid's in Mind' movie reviews website, and it got me to thinking...how do you plan on censoring/deciding what your children can and can't watch?\n\nGrowing up my parents were extremely lax with what I was allowed to watch and not watch.  They didn't really care if I was watching a show with adult content or sexual innuendo, most the time all that stuff just went over my head anyways.  I also watched a lot of horror movies as a kid (I loved them).  Sure, there were a couple that maybe my dad watched with me a little too young and I had some nightmares.  The worst I remember is I watched The Woman in Black with my dad when I was like 4 years old - I burst into tears in one scene and was scared of windows for a while.  Also I remember having a few werewolf dreams after watching American Werewolf in London at a young age.  I used to really love X-files and Unsolved Mysteries, although sometimes my parents wouldn't let me watch if it was too late/too close to bedtime.  But other than that.. I watched a lot of adult shows.  When I was in Gr. 1 my fav shows were Beverly Hills 90210 and Married with Children.  Don't get me wrong, I also loved a ton of childrens shows and cartoons - I didn't discriminate. I remember my friends parents had so many rules about what was allowed and what wasn't, and were shocked when I'd tell them my favourite shows.  Now, I really don't think it changed who I was as a kid...I still liked to do kid things, I didn't start wearing make-up or skimpy clothes, I didn't swear...and I didn't really know/understand what sex was until sex ed classes in health class.  I wasn't boy crazy and I didn't turn violent.  So, just from my experiences, I think I'm going to let her watch what she wants, within reason.  For example, if she gets nightmares from the Harry Potter movies, then I won't let her watch Hellraiser the next day.  But, if she enjoys watching horror or teen shows, or The Sopranos for that matter - then have at her.  I guess if I find she's starting to behave inappropriately as a result of something she saw then I would talk to her and explain it's OK to watch, but doesn't mean she can act that way.  If she doesn't accept that (or is too young to understand) then I'll dial down what she watches until she's older and does understand.  And this doesn't mean I'm going to plop my two year old in front of Criminal Minds and say 'have fun!'.  I just mean when it comes to HER asking ME to watch stuff, I'm going to give her the benefit of the doubt and take it from there.  But, I'm a first time mom - so who knows how this theory will play out in the long run, I'm just going by my own experiences as a kid.  Right now my biggest concern is her watching something that will really frighten/upset her.  I'm not really a believer that tv/movies/music/video games can be inherently BAD for your children.  All things in balance I guess.  Anywho, I'm really interested to hear your own personal plans/experiences with censorship and your kids.\n\nEdited: grammar & typos",

My wife is a nurse, and I am a disabled veteran (i even see a therapist and go to group counseling to avoid making my family suffer because of my PTSD), so WE often go without. \nNo new shoes for mom and dad\nNo new cloths for mom and dad. \nNo date nights for mom and dad.\nAnd that is fine! We made that choice.\nWe have ZERO help, no free childcare from grandma and grandpa, no one to pick up the kids when they are sick from school, we just have to leave work.\nour parents are unintrested.\nBut again, that is cool. We got this! \nWe work to maintain a clean home without limiting their creativity.\nWe support their project, their extracurriculars.\nWe JUST STOPPED DRIVING THEM TO AND FROM SCHOOL THIS YEAR. \nWe don't have sex when they are in the house, for fear of exposing them to anything (which means we go most of the summer without intimacy).\nWHAT LEAD TO THIS VISIT?\nA HOLLOWEEN COSTUME. \nWe allowed our kids to order their costumes, set no price limit.\nMy daughter got a FOX costume and my son got a \"secret agent\", his costume was trash, so we took the day, while they were at school, to run to Holloween city and turn his terrible costume into a great one. \nThat was our mistake: we got him a costume that was better than hers and he was getting compliments and she wasn't. \nShe started crying during trick or treating and forced us to go back to the house, we returned and sent her to her room while the rest of the family handed out candy and enjoy the night.\nNo problem, right?\nSaturday morning, as I am shampooing the carpet, I get a knock at the door. \nWhen she introduced herself as CPS, I thought the woman wanted to interview us about our neighbors, who are constantly screaming at their kids. \nCome to find out, an \"anonymous tip\" who had details only my daughter would know, and reported us for \"abuse and drinking\"...i had a beer while handing out candy! Lol. That was the first beer I had in three years....it just sounded like a nice way to spend the evening: watch the babies in their costumes and get a little head change. \nSo after the CPS worker talked to my kids, who were both in their rooms playing their expensive electronics, wearing their high end cloths, she left and we sat my daughter down. \nI told her we are going to encourage CPS to take her out of the home, so we can live in a group home for a few weeks. I want her to see how the rest of the world lives (I used to run away as a kid, and was put on probation instead of being asked \"why are you running away?\"..I eventually spent time in juvi and a group home, and I totally had to fist fight to keep my shoes. \nMy wife is devastated. \nWe have been married 20 years, and I have never broke her heart the way my daughter just did. \nI have never seen her this upset. \nAs of now: my daughter no longer has a room\nNo more electronics. \nNo more tv\nShe has to work for EVERYTHING including rent and food. \nIf she wants to draw a line in the sand, I will comply. \nThe best part: SHE REPORTED US, AND THEN CAME HOME FROM SCHOOL AND GOT MY WIFE TO BUY HER A NEW OUTFIT AND SHOES!! \nLOL.",

        "most_upvoted_comment": "I think it's very normal to feel anxious when someone you're close to is angry at you. But it's also important to stay the course and not give in to those feelings by softening your disciplinary stands solely out of a desire for him not to be angry at you. He's pushing boundaries, and that can hurt, but it's more important for the boundaries to be there. You can reiterate that you love him, always, and he can be angry at you, but there are lines that it's your job to keep. \n\nHis anger at you won't last forever, but the lessons you teach him about respect and boundaries hopefully will.",

After years of not taking her up on it due to her living an hour away I did. Her offering came the same day as my babysitter canceling so I said what the heck, let's do this. I triple checked if she was okay with it and mentioned still having a month to find someone else. She was compelety cool. I asked if she wanted to join us for dinner, which she didn't.\n\nOn the day before the event I checked up on her to make sure I could find someone else if she backed out last minute. She didn't respond but the morning of she let me know she had forgotten but was cool still coming. She asked if she could come an hour early but still didn't want to join us for dinner.\n\nShe didn't come an hour early. At her arrival time she texted 'on my way btw' and then a second text came saying 'can my boyfriend come?' with bathtime and three kids I wasn't able to read and respond so by the time I actually saw 10 minutes had passed and then I needed to discuss with my husband on how to handle this. For sure I figured he'd have stayed home due to my lack of responds. I was dead wrong and not even 10 minutes after I texted her that he couldn't join he stepped into our home, shoes already off ready to just stay there all night.\n\nIt was super awkward and we made sure to mention that there where no hard feeling and it wasn't personal at all but he was a stranger and we wheren't comfortable. Instead of him going home my friend kept trying to force us to agree and kept wishpering to him that she would also leave if he wasn't allowed to stay. He told her to stay and he left (but apparently stayed right outside our door, didn't know that until two days later). And she needed water and rest and wasn't clear on if she was going or staying.\n\nWe tried calling around but with 10 minutes until we had to leave we didn't really have a lot of options. We discussed one of us going but both my husband and I where trying to get the other to go. Neither of us wanted the other person to miss it. She left.\n\nShe just left and I'm so sad and mad and angry because of it. I don't get how you can promise weeks in advance, even gift 'free babysitting for a date night' as a wedding present and just leave. Cancel at anytime during the day, but don't leave when your uninvited guest can't stay.\n\nI'm not even mad about her bringing him, although I find it stupid and lady just pick up the damn phone and call when you don't get a reply to your question (although he most likely was already on the way when she send the text). I get that she doesn't have kids and didn't think it would be a big deal, but how could she just leave?\n\n  \nEdit: Now this guy, I've met him once by accident just two week prior but other then that I had spend two years listening to horrible stories about him. I barely know nice things about him. I tell my husband the awful things she tells me. We know about the sex tapes he had saved of all his exes on his second phone. I'm not really sure how that whole thing ended but they are still together and they apperently made a tape together too. My prude friend that I would have never ever thought would film herself during sex did. So my husband his mind went straight to 'man they are going to have sex in our house'. We know stories about alcohol abuse and coke and bad communication between them. We are not sure if it ever turned violent or not. Most likely not, but again I never thought she would make a sex tape either so I could be wrong.",

If she wants to have sex she's going to. Overly repressive or shame based opinions could potentially result in either shame around sex, or even promiscuity on the other end of the spectrum. Failure to prepare her with the necessary information can result in the same. The two of you should be able to expose her to different viewpoints equally. But she's going to make the final decision and that's fine. The worst thing you could do is uphold an expectation of how she should behave sexually.

I don\u2019t want another kid running around, every day, in our apartment. I will end up having to financially support both my stepdaughter and her child, inevitably -- I don\u2019t want this. And I don\u2019t want my wife\u2019s time taken away as it will stress her out, and it will affect our relationship as we won\u2019t have privacy and will have far less time together -- for potentially many years. I don\u2019t want to raise another kid. I\u2019m happy to be a grandpa, but I don\u2019t want to be a babysitter every day, and I fear this could happen. Who will care for this child when my stepdaughter goes to work or to school?\n\nI expressed this, and my wife's response was: \"Fine. If that happens, I will just go get a second job\" (working from home).\n\nI don't to come across as controlling, but at the same time, I'm terrified. I want my stepdaughter to make good decisions and to be successful in life, and I want to preserve a relationship with my wife and not have it taken over. I recognize I'm freaking out about something that hasn't even happened yet, and I know that's not really healthy. But the idea haunts me -- this kid is very irresponsible.\n\nI'm open to suggestions on how to approach things.",

        "content": "my 15 year old has been sneaking out and smoking wax pens/vapes. This started when she was 14. I locked down her phone restricted who she can talk to. I have her in extra curriculares, soccer at the high school, and spent quality time with her. I recently found out when she sneaked out she has slept with a significantly older guy twice. I am doing everything I can. I even have her older sister talking to her and monitoring her accounts while I do more in person consequences. I found out recently that she lied about the guys age and started doing this again. I have taken social media away. She cannot even download it on her phone. I\u2019m at a loss. What should/can i do? I just want her to behave better and not put herself in danger. Her father and I are still married and have a good relationship. We have family game night to bond. The only difference in the house is her older sister went away to college and isn\u2019t home as often. \n\nedit: \nthank you for all of your advice. i say i am \u201clooking\u201d into therapy due to there being extremely long waitlists and trying to find places is hard. Her phone is locked down so she can only text family when she needs to be picked up from practice from school. There are no second devices her room has been searched and she didn\u2019t know it was searched cause she was at school and i made sure everything was back where it was. \n\nedit: \nof course im reporting the guy. I wouldn\u2019t let my daughter be abused like that and do nothing about it. The guy is 20 and was 19 when it started. I tried the non-restrictive approach and hearing her out and everything before but that did not work. The family game nights aren\u2019t required and are only done if the kids ask and don\u2019t have a required day or time. Usually the way they happen is one of the kids saying I want to play games tonight and you can say yes or no to playing. Often times it rotates which kid doesn\u2019t want to play but they usually all do. Again, it is never forced and she is usually the one asking to play games after school. Also, her dad is in the picture and we have no plans of getting divorced and we are happy. She has a relationship with him and they have one on one time.  Also, my worry right now is not about her having sex it\u2019s about who she is having it with. She is on birth control and has had the hpv vaccine and everything. My main focus is how to get her to stop these behaviors that are putting her in danger not to get her to stop having sex. i\u2019m aware teenagers will find ways to have sex if they want to.",

Raising kids and working on the marriage is the hardest thing I've done in my life.\n\nCOVID was rough but I was able to make my change my work schedule to never had day care. We've never had it because she says \"I don't want a stranger raising my children\" & \"I don't want it\". Took off Wed-Fri every week for the first 3 years after my son was born. Today I still don't have a good idea on when I can actually arrive at work those 3 days.\n\nShe dropped down to part time (Wed-Fri) after our first child. For the first three years, she complained that we never see each other, but she worked those three days and I work the other four. We satisfied her want of no daycare.\n\nWhen my first turned 3, she allowed him to go to a child care center/pre preschool, but only 3 days a week, because my wife \"didn't want\" preschool on the 3 days she wasn't working. This finally allowed be to get to work at a 9AM those days I used to take off. Wake up, cook breakfast, pack lunch, drop off, walk dog, clean up the kitchen, then head to work.\n\nLast year, we had our second child. I took off another 3 months off of work. When her FMLA expired, we upped our first's preschool to 4 days a week and my in-laws would help with child care. She \"didn't want\" preschool everyday, so we're making it work.\n\nMy in-laws are no spring chickens and in their late 70s, but they're local. However, it's still a 50+ mile round trip drive to come down three days a week to take care of the second. Not sure when they show up, but I've asked for 10AM and they try to get here. If I'm real lucky, I could get to work by 10:30AM. However it's also weather dependent and may not come down due to snow, then I just have to take off of work another day. Again, wife doesn't a stranger to raise our kids. In-laws head home when she gets off of work, \\~5PM.\n\nToday, the first is in public preschool five days a week and we have after school care Wed-Fri. Again, because my wife \"didn't want\" after school care Mon-Tues because she's off.\n\nI'm trying to get back to working full time, but it's not really possible. Her solution is just for me to just take off more time to help more.\n\nDue to a multitude of factors, my gross is 3-5x what she makes. She works part time, went on Short Term Disability (which pays shit) after the two kids and once for orthopedic surgery. We're on her work's insurance, which reduces her pay since it's taken out pretax.\n\nWe can't get anything done and I'm drowning. Everything takes two people. One to watch the kids, so the other can just basic shit such as: get a hair cut, go to the doctor, mow the lawn, walk the dog, fold laundry, and if we're lucky: a daily shower. We've been talking about getting passports for well over a year and there's no time to do it.\n\nSince the first, the number of times we've gone out to dinner/date night is less than the years we've been married. Haven't had sex since we conceived the second.\n\nWish we had a single minute to sit down to talk about finances, retirement, kids tuition, solar, pick roof tile colors, but it hasn't happened. I've requested that we one of her parents to watch the second for a few hours when we're both not working (meaning I take off more time) and she says \"I don't want that\".\n\nI say we need more help, she thinks that I'm ungrateful and says her parents are helping a lot.

We hung out, had fun, and ate cake but thats not the problem here. We were going into deep conversation about our family and I talked to her about things that I was struggling with at home and with my mom. I was crying my eyes out when she suggests that I could talk to her parents and I agreed thinking that as parents they would understand from a different POV. As I'm crying and explaining to her mom and day what I was going though an how I felt her dad asked me to step out side with him while he smoked basically. (Side note there are cameras in here house including the garage where we were but they don't have audio) we sat on a lawnmower that was big like the one you sit on and it had a area for the feet to go where I sat. Immediately the conversation turned sexually. I was telling him something about my sister and how my mom would continually pick her over me and he asked me if she was sexually active, her couldn't see my face but I was confused about why he asked that but I responded with a no because even if I knew that's none of his business. He started asking me if I was active and I am not and never was. He was explaining to me that sex feels good for men and women and that it could get addictive if you don't really go about it right (I don't know how to explain that part) for a while the conversation was that way with him talking about sex and how it feels and that women absorb male energy during the deed and sometimes they act on that energy (again i don't know how to explain that). His wife came outside in the middle of his rant about it and he changed it but stayed on the topic of the things i was going though for the first time since we went outside. I forgot to add a few bits so I'm adding this a little late but I talk they how my sister almost got into a fight with one girl because the girls boyfriend wanted to be in a relationship with his girlfriend and my sister and I told my sister she should have left the problem alone and she said she did it just for the fun of it, her dad explained to me that he doesn't mind a poly relationship referring to what I told him about my sister. The conversation ended a whole after that at 9:50, I remember the time because I looked at my phone for a distraction, he did say he wanted to talk to my mom to make sure that she wouldn't think that she was having sex with me am that made me feel off. I appreciate her family because they have open they're home to me as a place to go when I'm struggling at home and just need a place to cool off but I don't know if I should go there often. My friend asked me today how the conversation with her dad and I went last night an I couldn't tell her, I don't know if I should tell her. She has told me that her mom and dad have almost divorced because he was paying for escorts so I already know the kinda idea that she has of him. He had me sit in the middle of his legs with just a little space between us when we out side. I can't bring myself to talk about it out loud which is why I'm typing it an I don't know if I should tell her about it because I feel very uncomfortable about it and I feel that if I say it out in word I might just break down and I don't wanna ruin what's left if the images that she have of her dad. I don't know what to do. Her dad is also close to the age of my own dad who is 50 something.",

I started a new trade job in the Union when our last daughter (8m) was born. I have been so exhausted and while we still had sex it was only a few times. She was on post-natal birth control and the odds seemed in our favor that she would not be able to conceive again. She is rather forgetful and it's possible she missed a pill or something but truthfully that's not her fault since I ought to have accountability as well. It just seemed that with just having a baby and her being on the birth control and breast feeding (which is like natural birth control) we were being pretty safe. And how exhausted I've been from work and how much less frequently we've been engaging in sex. We said our recent born child would be our last. However it is not the case. I'm not mad or anything but this extra addition is going to add a huge hurdle. We don't necessarily have space in our car for another child. We dont have space in our house for another child. And I was truthfully looking forward to my wife being able to work again and contribute. I think I'm just really stressed but wish I could just be happy. I just know it's going to be a lot now and I'm trying to just be happy (We are both pro-life btw so alternative solutions are not on the table) It's just a lot for a dad to have this extra responsibility and to be the only one capable of fixing our situation and habitability for our new addition. Part of me hopes for a boy. I love my girls and they have definitely helped me be more empathetic, emotional, and overall more respectful towards woman. I just would like some advice from you guys on how you would go about this situation. My net pay a week is $1000-1400 depending on overtime.

We became friends first and tried to keep God in the center of our relationship so we avoided sex for maybe a year even though we both have had plenty of sex before meeting to try to do it different\n\nIf I\u2019m being honest, I think I settled for her. The chemistry was good enough at the beginning but besides the initial lust, it never matched the level that I\u2019ve experienced previously. \n\nThe chemistry is at a very low level and has been since kids. The differences have become more apparent and I\u2019m not really attracted to her anymore even though I do love her. Just not in love. Sexual chemistry isn\u2019t exactly aligned as she\u2019s more vanilla and enjoys different things than I do. \n\nWhile we have parents, we don\u2019t try to take advantage of them but our budget is tight so we can\u2019t regularly get a babysitter. We try to do at least one date night a month and at least one lunch date each week or every other week depending on schedules but even during those dates, there\u2019s not a lot of excitement. We\u2019ve also made it work to take a trip by ourselves this year and last year since we enjoy experiencing different cities. \n\n\n**The family:**\n\nOn top of going through her tantrum and mom only phase 3 year old just had a bunch of sickness for a week that included a hospital trip this week so she was home all week and now we have another four day stretch because daycare is closed. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s natural to feel exhausted after the week we\u2019ve had. \n\nI used to think I wanted kids but unfortunately realized after having them that I enjoy being an uncle. I told my wife a couple years before we had our first that I don\u2019t think I want kids anymore but then changed my mind because I wanted to please her and our parents. \n\nSince we had our second, I\u2019ve come close to leaving but I find a way to fight through it because I feel obligated. I definitely had postpartum depression and was frequently angry at myself for putting myself in this situation as well as God for allowing it to happen. I was also angry at society for influencing my feelings on home power ship, marriage, and parenting\u2014that it\u2019s something so magical to strive for. Maybe for some. \n\n\n**Additional info:**\n\nI\u2019ve also been trying to find a different job for 8 months, getting close with being a runner-up so that\u2019s been consuming and draining. Part of the reason is to increase my salary and also looking for a fresh start. I married into debt (credit and school) and while I helped her manage her money, she took on additional graduate school debt so finances are tight for our expenses and what we bring in. \n\nI have a few close friends to distract me but they\u2019re all DINKs and I do get jealous. But I\u2019m also missing the intimacy in general with friends and a lover. I get away for a couple hours a week for a hobby and I try to work out during lunch a few times a week while hanging out with a friend once a month. \n\nI think I\u2019m a decent dad compared to some that I know and I try to be. I\u2019ve sacrificed a lot for my family, both big and small things. I try to pull my weight around the house with cleaning, dishes, laundry, and some grilling/cooking. \n\nI\u2019ve done therapy both solo and couples and it seems to help for a little bit but the feeling returns. I get tired of this. \n\nI know I\u2019ve made some shitty and selfish decisions to \u201cget by\u201d and I\u2019m trying to figure out my how to live life to make myself and my family happy while not losing my sense of self.",

I also found out my husband had cheated while I was dealing with the issues of my high risk pregnancy alone. \n\nI did not even want to have sex. I've repeatedly asked that we work on all our other issues before worrying about physical needs. Sex just happens when he wants it regardless of my protests. I won't use the R word, because I guess I could ultimately fight, but I didn't want it. \n\nMy mental state has been wild and I'm running on auto mode just trying to provide and be there for my kids.

        "content": "TLDR; My partner, 2 year old son\u2019s father, gets angry and rough with our son\u2026 am I staying somewhere that\u2019s harmful to my son? (Included relationship context). \n\n**I thought about posting this in relationship advice but honestly, I didn\u2019t want a bunch of non-parents giving me advice. There are so many nuances and depths that are only really learned when we become parents, I believe. \n\nMy partner (28M) and I (28F) have been through so much. We found each other at a time where we were in deep introspection & working on ourselves a lot. We both got mixed up with toxic family again and obviously had some stuff to work through. But we got pregnant pretty quick and had so much family that said they would support us so we decided that we could do it. We agreed that even if our relationship didn\u2019t work, we would be good co-parents together (based off of our personalities, literally agreeing on everything relating to raising him, and so many other factors). \n\nAnyway, we are both pretty traumatized people but have worked SO hard together. I mean, therapy on therapy. Talking SO much and honestly, we get so many kudos from our therapists and friends because we\u2019re a pretty good team even if we aren\u2019t always at first (butting heads at times). Anyway, he\u2019s a hard physical worker, I\u2019m a homemaker. We make plans together, talk about everything, we are polyamorous and support each other in our individual, independent lifestyles & relationships. We agree on pretty much everything regarding our son. Like life feels so safe with him - especially given the fact that I\u2019d never felt secure with anyone before him (including youth, as I grew up in a severely rough environment). Anyway, we tackled each other\u2019s toxic family together, call each other out and help each other grow to be better than we used to be. We have identified so many things that we learned from how we were raised & have worked to get rid of them so our relationship could be independent from those influences. \n\nWith all of that said, he has always been a little careless with our son. Especially in the first year. I had to seriously teach him boundaries & how to be gentle and when to stop. What our son sounded like when he meant \u201cno\u201d before he could speak it. I still have to point out to him that he\u2019s saying no at times. When to not torture tickle, etc. We actually discovered he had also been sexually abusing me through sexual coercion. We heavily worked through this together and sure, I still don\u2019t always feel safe (again, previous sexual trauma) but it very rarely happens now and I\u2019m happy that he was able to grow from it. \n\nNow, my biggest issue that seems to linger is that when he is putting our son to sleep, he starts to get impatient. He sometimes gets mad and in the past would raise his voice very loudly, jostle him extra hard when doing the \u201cbounce\u201d I\u2019m sure you all know and his \u201cpatting\u201d would be VERY loud. This would scare the shizz out of me and I have always stopped it. As we worked on things with lots of deep conversations of getting to the root of the issues, how to take breaks before actual anger set into action, therapy etc - it doesn\u2019t happen often. I would say the only time it was \u201coften\u201d was when we were super sleep deprived and he wasn\u2019t in therapy yet. \n\nOur son will NOT fall asleep with me anymore - literally just uses breastfeeding to stay awake and fiddle. He just won\u2019t do it. I\u2019ve tried so many ways and for the longest time, I took over sleep by myself because it was just healthier for everyone. But anyway, it\u2019s happened twice in the last week and the last time he did it, I told him that he\u2019s putting me in a very serious spot where I have to think about the safety of my son (and myself) and if we need to leave or not. I was very honest with him and told him I was extremely uncomfortable and felt unsafe, that he needed to sleep in our guest room for the night. Now, the next day he said he would make this a top priority in therapy and that he will make sure to work on it. We talked about needing to get to the root of things & how stuff like this isn\u2019t JUST a \u201chow do I control it\u201d but \u201cwhy is this happening?\u201d and \u201cwhere is this coming from\u201d type of deal. He agreed and so on. A side note - one night between the last time and tonight, I had told him I wasn\u2019t interested in sex because I was emotionally drained and it was late. He woke me up in the middle of the night & I felt pressured, etc. The next morning I expressed (something I\u2019ve already told him) that if I say no because of a lack of time & energy, I\u2019m not going to want to be woken up to do it. He essentially said that he expected me to just say no or stop him once I woke up. We got to a point where he said he won\u2019t do that again & that he understands why it was wrong. This is with some context that we have enjoyed some wake up, sleepy play in our relationship many times. \n\nBut tonight, our son was just not getting to sleep. He spilled some (not super) hot soup on his leg while we were getting dinner together & I think maybe that was bothering him? Though there were no marks. I\u2019m not sure. Sometimes kids just don\u2019t want to sleep. Anyway, I heard it was a tough go to get him to sleep but my partner was calm and gentle and everything. But suddenly I just hear our son cry (not falling asleep) and then I hear a really loud thud - I\u2019m literally on the opposite end of a rectangular 1500 sq ft house. I hear it start up as \u201cpatting\u201d but loud & obviously way too hard. I\u2019m already looking at the camera and walking fast to our son\u2019s room, I come in and I tell his dad to leave. Meanwhile, our son ESCALATES because he saw me and sounded scared. Partner leaves as I tell him he\u2019s never, ever allowed to touch him like that ever. I proceed to try and get him to sleep for an hour, failing. His dad tries to come help & he starts using key words that means he\u2019s scared (fire alarm, etc bc he\u2019s scared of those things). And then he just can\u2019t calm down, keeps crying, wants to animals with us, eats a cookie, is obviously so so tired. Anyway, eventually I try to cuddle him and his dad convinced him to read a bunch of stories together. They do & they fall asleep together. I\u2019m here and just overall anxious & wondering if I\u2019m \u201cthat\u201d mom who\u2019s staying with the guy hurting her baby?? I don\u2019t even know. Is this something fixable that\u2019s just like one-off frustrations? I\u2019m so confused.

        "content": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m a mom to 2 boys (3.5 and 5 years old) and married to my husband for 6 years. I love my boys but they definitely keep me on my toes, especially the younger one. He\u2019s hard to handle at times and definitely pushes boundaries. We rent a 3 bedroom apartment with hopes to buy a home in a few years but we live in a very HCOL area. Moving is  not an option as we have family here and our kids are well established at their school. They go to a private school that we\u2019re very happy with and we\u2019re are firm on not moving them. With my second I had post partum depression bad. He wouldn\u2019t sleep, only wanted me to hold him, was always cranky etc. to top it off my oldest at the time was speech delayed and was frustrated he couldn\u2019t communicate. I missed all of my youngests \u201cfirsts\u201d by blocking out the entirety of his first year of life. I genuinely don\u2019t remember anything other than pictures and videos I have taken. I have been a SAHM since having my oldest and have recently started working again, I love my job and enjoy working but I don\u2019t make much (I\u2019m an ECE). My husband works construction and makes very decent money as we\u2019ve been single income up until recently. He paid rent, tuition, groceries, bills, etc all on his own but we were tight at times. Recently I\u2019ve really been wanting a 3rd baby. My husband says he\u2019s done but we\u2019ve recently talked about it hypothetically and he said he\u2019d really be excited and even started discussing potential names. Truth be told I want a girl but I really do think regardless of the sex, I just want 3. Of course I just pray whatever it is, it\u2019s healthy. Here in Canada we get 12-18 months paid maternity leave. But adding in diapers and formula back in the mix is a lot. Then we would have to pay for daycare again on top of our boys tuition and eventually our 3rds tuition when they start school (roughly $30K for all 3 a year). The school is K-grade 8 and you can start the year you turn 3. So I would have them in school all together at the same time. Is it doable? Yes. Is it tight? Also yes. I don\u2019t want my son\u2019s quality of life (comfortable spending on fun stuff sometimes) to go down if we have another but they have also been asking for a sibling. I\u2019m thankful for what I have but my family doesn\u2019t feel complete to me. A voice keeps ringing in my head saying \u201cyou\u2019ll regret not having a 3rd but you\u2019ll never regret having one\u201d. All my family members have 2 kids and have all said they would do 3 if they could do it over. I\u2019m turning 30 this year and my husband is 32 so we\u2019re young. I don\u2019t want to wait too long because I don\u2019t want a super large gap between my oldest and youngest child. Will a third be left out because his/her brothers are so close? Will they become a trio? I don\u2019t want the bond my boys have ruined. My grandma had a dream the other night of our family and she said she saw my boys and a daughter, idk it just feels like a sign. As weird as it sounds her dreams usually come true. Im just conflicted. What\u2019s the transition from 2-3? Is it crazy? How did you afford it? Do you feel complete? I literally cry at the idea of never hearing first words, not seeing first steps and I was so out of it with my second I don\u2019t remember any of it. I\u2019m sorry this is such a long read but I\u2019m just looking for experiences? I think my biggest hurdle is money. My husband said we can make anything work but it\u2019s still a worry I have.

        "content": "Back story: With my first pregnancy, I found out the gender  (boy) at the 20 week ultrasound and experienced terrible gender disappointment until he was born, at which point I fell in love. With this pregnancy, I decided to wait until birth to find out the sex to avoid feeling the same way if it was another boy.\n\nMy son is now 2 and the light of my life. With that being said, I still get sad here and there when people in my life have daughters or when I walk past the girl clothes in stores. \n\nWith my due date approaching, I\u2019m starting to feel extremely anxious and terrified about experiencing gender disappointment at birth if the baby is a boy. I\u2019ve tried everything I can to prepare myself\u2026 picking a boy name, envisioning the baby exclusively as a boy, thinking about how sweet a bond between brothers will be, imagining cute matching outfits for my boys, following Instagram influencers that have all boys etc. Unfortunately, none of it has helped. \n\nNo matter how hard I try, I can\u2019t stop thinking about all the experiences I\u2019ll miss out on if I never have a daughter (we are not having more than 2 kids, especially not just for the purpose of having a specific gender). I keep thinking that I\u2019ll never get to buy the cute girl clothes, never get to go grad dress or wedding dress shopping, never get a chance to do mother-daughter trips, never get to plan a baby shower etc. Logically, I know none of these experiences would be guaranteed even if I did have a daughter, but at least there would be a chance (as opposed to if I have 2 boys).\n\nGrowing up, my mom and I were always very close and spent a lot of time together due to our shared interests. Likewise, my dad and my brother spent a lot of time together due to their shared interests. I worry if I have 2 boys, I\u2019ll spend a lot of time at home alone while my husband gets to do fun shared activities with the 2 of them. I will absolutely take an interest in whatever my boys are interested in, but I worry it won\u2019t come as naturally as if I had a daughter. \n\nI also worry about when my sons grow up and not being as close to them/ their families as I would be if I had a daughter. I like my MIL just fine, but there\u2019s no comparison between the relationship I have with my own mom. My mom has gotten pregnancy updates every step of the way and was much more involved after my son\u2019s birth than my MIL, simply because I felt more comfortable having my own mom around. I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll be on the sidelines.\n\nWe only have one set of friends that has 2 boys, and when their 2nd baby was born, they were met with a lot of pitying looks and \u201cyou could always try again for a girl\u201d. I know I\u2019ll have a hard time dealing with this, even though I tell myself not to care what people think.\n\nNone of these feelings are rational, and I know if I have another boy I will love him just as much as I love my son, but a part of me worries I\u2019ll feel a little sad forever. I worry that I\u2019ll feel sad every time I see a mother-daughter out in public, or every time one of my friends shares an experience specific to mothers and daughters.\n\nI don\u2019t agree with having another baby just to \u201ctry\u201d for a certain gender. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair to anyone.\n\nMy question is, how can I prepare for birth knowing I could face potential gender disappointment? How do I come to terms with the fact that I may never have a daughter? And, for those of you who did experience gender disappointment, does it ever go away or is it just something I\u2019ll have to learn to cope with over time?\n\nThank you in advance \ud83d\udc9b\n\nTL;DR: I\u2019m due in a few months, already have a son, and extremely worried I\u2019ll experience gender disappointment at birth if this baby is another boy.",

My husband and in laws are pushing for it since my husband had a positive experience with doing so himself as a child. \n\nWe've gone through the obvious pros and con. I also know that it depends largely on the child. However, I'd like to hear some of the less obvious pros and cons that can come up. \nFor instance, my husband skipped a grade in both elementary school and high school. This unluckily lined up with him missing both sex ed classes offered and somehow no one thought to have those talks with him. This has resulted in a skewed view of sex for him growing up and some interesting conversations between us  . . . \n\nPlease hit me with with any unexpected advice or experiences you may have.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "No Personal experience with it, but my close friend (who is 30 now) skipped two grades. She felt very vulnerable and young when it came to junior and senior year. While kids were driving, she was not. While they were prepping to move out and be on their own, she was just focusing on getting a license. When she graduated high school and was expected to be an adult, she wasn't developmentally there. Sure, she was really smart and had wonderful grades, but she literally hadn't  developed to the point that her peers had yet, and she felt lost about that. She brings it up a lot.",

I've been discussing hygiene with her but she is struggling with some things still and it can be frustrating because it is simple things but I think she doesn't have to do these things when she is with the other parent every other week and that is a big issue. \n\nI really want to ask, do you have any you tube channel suggestions or anything that she could enjoy watching / relate to more, that talk about hygiene, her body, periods, sex, speaking up for herself, being confident, ECT. ? I embarrass her sometimes, when I talk about stuff and I feel she doesn't listen once she feels embarrassed or even called out on bad hygiene. Once she knows she is guilty of something I said, she switches off into mopey self pity mode and stops listening. \n\nAlso, she isn't always cleaning herself correctly or thoroughly after using the bathroom or even showering, she continues to have poop stained undies, not a little skid either, much more than that. She pees her self sometimes still when playing and doesn't want to stop playing. That's been a big issue but it has been getting better. \n\nHow can I be sure she is cleaning herself properly?  I hate to be invasive or look at her to check but sometimes I feel like that's the only option left she is giving me. I had not done that yet but I don't know sometimes what to do. Her dad can't do these things now at her age and her mom could care less. \n\nShe loves me greatly and knows I care about her and her well being. I also know the importance of boundaries and respecting her body and I want her to know, no one should be looking at her private areas without consent when she is older too. I want to be respectful of her but also she doesn't seem to listen because she is in a hurry and just doesn't want to do what she should be doing. \n\nHow do you parents do it!? Whew.",

Try to help my mom but mentally, she\u2019s gone, lost in drug addiction and depression.\n2020 my mom passed.\n\nSo now, we live all together with my fianc\u00e9e and 2 girls, my nephews are 16.\n\nThey\u2019re twins, but vastly different. One has goals, aspirations, not super interested in drugs, sex, etc\n\nThe other one I\u2019ve always had issues with. He started looking at porn at a very young age. He started vaping in middle school. A lot of grounding ensued. Taking phone. Taking xbox. Honestly it never really seemed to help anything.\n\nNow he\u2019s sneaking out at night. He took his phone a few times so I knew because if life 360. I told him no more, that he needs to be home around 11 on weeknights and 12/1 on weekends. So now he\u2019s sneaking out without his phone so life360 isn\u2019t notified. He\u2019s smoking weed, and probably vapes and who knows what else. This year he is doing better in school though, so there\u2019s that. He\u2019s got an interest in welding that I\u2019m helping him pursue. \n\nWell, everyone around me says I need to be harder on him. I told my coworker that he snuck out and they were in complete shock and asked if I grounded him. He\u2019s 16, he\u2019s close to be an adult. What am I supposed to do? I\u2019ve basically just try to talk to him. He\u2019s getting a job soon also. But I just know  all of his money is going to weed/vapes. I just feel like the harder I\u2019m on him the worst/out of control it becomes, but at the same time it feels really out of control already. He\u2019s also going out with his girlfriend a lot. He says she\u2019s in birth control and I stress the importance of protection, so hopefully he\u2019s listening to me in that front. \n\nWhat can I do? I feel like I\u2019m failing him so badly!",

In this month i have noticed at least 5, 6 times that my husband has had erections ( or semi ere***ons) when playing, holding or having the baby in the lap.\n\n First time i saw, he was playing with the baby and the baby was kicking him on the di*k with the feet, after that baby was sitted shortly in his lap and when he removed him i saw erec*ion ( and i thought, ok, it was from the kicks),\n\n second time same day, the baby was sitting in his lap while husband was laying down on his back and told me to get the baby, i took the baby and some seconds after i took the baby, he had ere**ion.\n This has happened few times when holding him in that same position and playing playstation or watching tv, he gives me the baby from his lap and i see that the d**k is somewhat erected (longer, thicker), maybe not full hard on erect, but definitely not flacid (husband laying on the back with folded knees and baby sat on his stomach with back resting on husband's legs).\n\n one time im taking a shower, baby was on the table for changing without diaper.  Husband walks in, i told him to remove the shirt of the baby and give him to me so i can shower the baby and when he handled me the baby he had semi erec*ion. I wash the baby quickly, gave it to him and i continued to have the shower myself, he put the clothes, was holding the baby and waiting for me to get out of the shower and got again erect*on ( i think full), and i say to myself, ok maybe he got erec* because I'm in the shower...\n\n Yesterday he was holding the baby in his arms and kissing him on the head in a sweet way and i see he had er*ction, I'm not sure if he saw  that i look him down, but he came to me and touched my private parts in a playful way. \n\nmy question is, WHAT SHOULD I THINK ABOUT THIS??\n\nI know men have random erec**ons during the day, and i know that also before the we had the baby he was getting randomly hard and/or would touch his own D up and down when watching tv or something random. And when i have asked why he does that, he was saying, it's just a men's thing, that he's not aroused, just that he likes to joke around/touch his D.\nI was thinking that's somewhat weird, but didn't have a problem with that.\n\nHowever, now that I'm a mom, this is putting some uneasy questions in my head. I don't want to think that he has some sick thoughts, but at the same time i ask myself am i just putting a blind eye? \n\nIs this normal? Have you had erec**ons when playing with your kids? Am I paranoid that now every time he's with the baby i look at his D.  Please help me out here. \n\nI spoke today with him about it, and he said he doesn't know why that happens, that it doesn't happen all the time, that its not about the baby, he wants to f**k in the moment, but the reaction is not about the baby. That he doesn't have s*x too much. And that sometimes it's not even wanting sex, but the pressure that the baby puts when he sit on him, that they can happen randomly even when he drives the car... And i gave him the example that i saw it yesterday when he was kissing the baby, and he started to be mad at me, to say i have too much s*it in my head, etc... and becams angry and not wanting to speak with me. Our marriage is already on the verge, i didn't want one more problem, but at the same time i was thinking that is better to tell him that.",

We became found family at the onset of his teenage-hood and we have talked to him about sex, relationships, and ect.\n\nWithout going into detail, he had been through a lot before we adopted him, and that trauma definitely has impacted how he interacts with the world. As a result, understandably, he has always been immature compared to his similarly aged peers. \n\nHe had his first relationship around 14, which resulted in his first kiss. However, both he and the girl were hot and cold about each other, and it ended pretty quickly. We didn't think too much about it as it seemed like garden variety young love and learning. That is until, about a year after they broke up, we were at the dinner table talking about first kisses and our son chimes in with sometbing along the liens of \"Yeah, I didn't even like the girl I kissed. I just used her to get my first kiss.\"\n\nWe were taken aback, and we explained to him that this is not how he should see or treat people. We let it go after that because felt like we parented it, but also that maybe he was just putting on a show of bravado and trying to seem cool.\n\nHe is now in his second relationship at 16. At first, all was sunshine and rainbows, and he was very excited about her. She has a job and a car, and she showered him with gifts and attention, two things he values quite a lot. For his birthday, she spent quite a hefty sum, getting him thoughtful and nice gifts and giving him money as well. However, when her birthday came around, he refused to buy her any gifts and instead dug around in his old jewelry drawer and pulled out an old necklace that he explained  he didn't like anymore and had no use for. He didn't even want to wrap it. We explained that she had spent a lot of money and thought on him and he should do the same for her, but he blew us off and spent all of his money on himself when he went out next. \n\nWe came from the rear and bought additional gifts for her \"from the family\" so that she would not only have a single, unwrapped, secondhand item. \n\nAfter her birthday, their text exchanges became pretty odd. He would go from blowing up her phone with texts demanding that she answer him immediately, to completely ignoring her. And when she asked for comfort/reassurance about their relationship, he blew her off and told her to stop talking about it and she was silly to worry. After one of their bouts where he messaged her repeatedly, she apologized and told him that one of the side of effects of her medication makes her sleepy. Our son told her that she was using her medication as an excuse and that it was unacceptable/not a valid reason in his opinion.\n\nCurrently, he is ignoring his girlfriend, and has been for weeks. She reaches out to him via text and other platforms, but he refuses to respond, despite messaging with his other guy friends constantly. Homecoming is around the corner and he refuses to buy their tickets, flowers, or even put together a nice outfit for the night. Despite all of this, he claims she is still his girlfriend and things are fine between them. We've offered to cover tickets and flowers and he has nice things to wear. We've asked what color his girlfriend's dress in, in an effort to get something together for her, but he ignores us or blows us off. \n\n\nWe aren't sure how to parent this and any advice would be appreciated. We've had our son in therapy with multiple therapists. The first few were provided by the state, and they all stopped seeing him because they report that he tells them that everything is fine, he feels happy, and that he has an immature understanding of relationships (platonic/familial) but that there is no reason to continue to see him as there is nothing he wants to work on. We had him with a private therapist and we were not privy to much information. The therapist did communicate that our son reports that he has no issues and mostly chats about school and the books is he reading. We understand that trauma impacts social relationships and WHY he may be acting this way, but we need some help on parenting him through it. \n\nWe're not sure what to do next.",

The best thing that could happen to him right now is for her to yell at him - you\u2019ve been a dick, I\u2019m not putting up with this anymore, we\u2019re done. Let them go their separate ways and hope that she chooses a boyfriend who is more respectful in the future. Your son doesn\u2019t need you helping him right now, he needs to experience consequences. Act like a jerk to your girlfriend, she breaks up with you, in your next relationship you don\u2019t act like that.",

I go to weddings alone. I don't things with her. We tried couples therapy the first 2 years for sex stuff(which didn't work as basically someone's sex drive can't be changed)and again years later(which didn't work because she felt attacked). I give you all this backstory because we have a 2.5 year old and my wife blames parenting on ruining her life and our relationship. For sure it's been harder and no we aren't as close. Because when she laid in bed the entire first summer after we had her and left me to primary care for a 6 month old on days I was also supposed to be working a switch flipped for me. This was my actual baby and I was going to devote my attention to them as I should. My daughter doesn't make me fearful or anxious. Just joy. So it was easy to focus on her but I know my wife felt it. And we have been again to therapy but have stopped. Last night she called our child an asshole(not the first time). I told her it wasn't fair to say parenting ruined her life when it wasn't easy before the baby. I told her how I felt I lost more of her each year before this happened. She responded by  throwing something at me so hard it caused a welt and asking for a divorce. My father abused us as kids and I always wish my mom left. But I know it's not that easy.

My daughter is 7 and in second grade.  I know she doesn't need an in-depth discussion about sex right now.

I do not at all feel that it's solely the school's responsibility to educate my child regarding puberty and sex, but I did feel they should play a part, especially considering some parents will never teach their children about these things.

I actually have a few friends who are gay and I'm really sad that they need to hide in public spaces and have always tried to make them feel welcome the way they are in my home.

He argues, if I call him out and tells this younger siblings things like \"PLEASE don't become \\*expletive\\*\".\n\nI know, logically, that he is getting this from his peers and that most teenagers try to fit in at all cost and that they rebel against their parents. I know he might even change his stance later. I know that this is not an individual character flaw, but an expression of the culture we live in, but I'm just so disappointed with him.\n\nThere are so many things going through my head:  Is it still safe to have gay friends over (I'm not sure he's aware they are gay)? Which effect could this have on the younger kids hearing such opinions from their big bro they admire? What did I do wrong for this to happen? How can I change his mind/teach him some compassion?

Is it okay to implement consequences for such comments around the house/around siblings (dad doesn't back me up on that)? Should we change his schools to a more open/international school? and so much more.\n\nI don't know what to do about this.

I live in the US, but I still get anxious if my husband puts his head on my shoulder or tries to hold my hand in public. So I get it. Homophobia sucks ass, but if he speaks out against it, he'll become a target, too. I think it's important that you teach him to be more loving and accepting, but you have to remember that at his age he's going to go against anything you try to tell him. I would definitely put my foot down to him speaking to his siblings that way. I'd also try to be understanding that if he doesn't act this way with his friends, not only might he lose his friends, but they could also decide to use physical violence to make an example out of him. \n\nIt's easy for us in the US to get on our high horses and say that you should always fight injustice, but sometimes it's more complicated than that. It's good that you're talking to him about it, and trying to offer him a better perspective, but I'm not going to pretend that I don't understand his perspective either. I do. It's easier to be one of the bullies than it is to be one of the victims, and if you're country makes it dangerous to be gay, then it might be for the best that he blends in with everyone else. [Matthew Shephard was eye opening](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Shepard) for a lot of people, but the gay community saw it coming for a long time. Most of us were just trying to avoid ending up being him. \n\nAll I'm saying is, I'd try to be understanding about it. At the same time, you can set rules for your own house, such as \"we don't use those words in this house\" or \"we don't tolerate discrimination in this house\" but you can't really control how he behaves outside the house. I'd also try to remember that the most homophobic people tend to be closeted homosexuals, so it's possible he's struggling with concealing his own identity.",

        "content": "This post may be lengthy, but I've got to get it out of me, so sorry in advance. When your kids are small, it's so much easier to shield them from the cruel parts of life. Teenagers, however make you feel like you're reliving all your own past bad experiences, and even though you have the gift of hindsight, you're still powerless to apply any of the hard lessons you had to learn from them. \n\nLast night as I was bathing my younger 3 daughters(7,3&2) and getting them ready for bed, I popped in on my oldest; Cheynea's (shay-nuh) room. I started picking up things and handing her folded laundry to put away and notice she is watching me, Waitimg for me to leave. She had on headphones so I knew she was chatting with her friends. So I made some weird joke directed towards the friends (I do this alot because he friends will argue with her about my level of coolness as a mom, we have high expectations of her, but I'm not generally overbearing or combative with her which works for us and we typically have a silly play-banter vibe in our communication) idk if that's relevant. Cheynea did not smile/smirk/laugh/retort but just stared back at me with a raised eyebrow as if to say, \"you're annoying, go away\" and so I lightheartedly questioned her about the \"stanky eyebrow\" she was giving me and realized she may have been crying before I walked in the room. \n\nI asked what's up and she said she was on the phone, which normally isn't an issue, and she will usually put it on speaker and tell whoever she's talking to \"say hi to my mom\" so over dramatized pretending to be offended in jest and left saying \"don't be a jerk all your life\" but nothing. No comeback. 0 response. \n\nA few minutes later I came to bring her sister's clean clothes in to put away (she shares a room with my 8yo on the weeks I have her- 2w with me, 2w with her dad, and so on). I asked if she was still on the phone \"with them losers\" and laughed and she said \"I'm muted, cause I was crying.\" So I asked what happened and who do I have to stab (totally a joke) and she just rolled her eyes and waved me away. So I left and tried to give her some privacy. \n\nOf course, I wanted to make sure she was ok, and also let her know that I care so after I had all the littles in bed about 30min later I went back and asked her why she was upset, and she tells me that she had just been in a group chat with her BFF (K 17f) and the guy (17m) she had recently started \"talking to\" and that somehow the 2 were now \"together\" and had just notified her. \n\nI'm like \"TF??! Why??\" So, she tells me that she hadn't told her BFF that she liked this guy, but she had told him, and he told her he liked her too, they just weren't officially dating yet. (I use the term \"dating\" loosely bc she has yet to be allowed out with a boy unsupervised aside from walking though our neighborhood with instructions to check in via phone call with me periodically, 1.bc I was still in hs when I got pregnant with her, and 2.bc there are crazy people out there and I just want to know she's safe.)\n\nAnyway, so they tell her this in the chat and after a minute she mutes herself bc she didn't want them to know she was crying, but she can hear them say \" I don't know if that went very well.\" \n\nThat tells me that the BFF knew she liked the guy and swooped in on him anyway. So I say \" dude, she's not your friend is she did that knowing you guys were talking\" she tells me the rest of how it all transpired, and what I got from it is that the guy had told K privately that he and cheynea were talking and in the chat K made a comment that made it sound like cheynea was also talking to someone else (she isn't and has been broken up with her previous \"bf\" for about a month but they've remained on good terms because they have a group of mutual friends and see each other fairly regularly at orchestra practice.) \n\nSo, K texts Chey privately during the chat and asks if she is mad at her and Chey said \" oh no I'm fine, it's not like you made me out to be a cheater or anything\" and then they sort of mildly gang up on her via text saying oh no she didn't make you out that way, nobody thinks that, blah blah. So to K, Chey says about of self deprecating things about her being less pretty/cool/fun and so ofc the guy chose K over her. (None of which is true, the only thing K has over Chey in a boys view is that she's not a virgin, and Chey is)\n\nNow, K's parents are much less attentive to her then myself and my husband and my ex and his wife are to cheynea. So, she can sneak out and get away with alot more, and for the most part Chey is a really good kid on her own. I'm not saying she isn't interested in sex, but she's not \"the easy girl\" by any means. \n\nSo I'm trying to be a friend as well as a mom and give it to her straight, but gentle. I tell her that a lot of guys that age are unfortunately, going to take the path of least resistance when it comes to getting laid, but that doesn't mean she should just throw it out there like it means nothing. I have a 2 hour heart to heart with her where she goes over all the details, and he confusion about her friends actions and then after she leveled with her and told her she was hurt, but that she was her BFF and she forgives her and if she's happy that's all that matters, K flips it on her in the chat Infront of dude and starts guilt tripping Chey and  having both of them now reassuring her that she did nothing wrong. (Let me tell you this little sneaky shitty friend hoodrat hoebag knew exactly what she was doing \ud83d\udcaf) So I don't make the post any longer, I wont get into all the details that made that clear to me, but she knew and she betrayed my Chey, and then tried to low-key embarrass/shame her and villainize her not only in the dude's eyes, but even to herself. Fuck K. Chey has forgiven her, and I want to nurture that forgiveness and compassion in her, but she is hurting and I'm hurting watching her heart break over the boy not choosing her and over the realization that her friend is a manipulative, back-biting, attention Wh***, and is willing to hurt someone who has been loyal and protective and helpful to her in so many ways for the last 3years, just so she can have another dude's attention for maybe a month or 2 (judging by her track record).\n\nKnowing what I know now, I want to tell her to just realize she's better than both of them, and not to let it affect her, or to out that girl for the stank-ass little beety eyed monster she has shown herself to be, but I know I can't take the pain from her and I can't give her the foresight to prove that those 2 are insignificant in the grand scheme of things, and I just have to let her live through it and learn it for herself, like every teenage girl has to do. \n\nShe was depressed all day today, wouldn't eat or come out of her room other than to go to the bathroom, I couldn't get her to crack a smile or say more than two words to me, and it killed me to see her that way, I just wanted to take it from her and see her smile. This afternoon, I wrote out the lyrics to \" a letter to my daughter\" with a little note reminding her how awesome, and beautiful she actually is and how proud of her I am, and how cool she is (& jokingly also how cool I am lol) and that I hope she will never stop being her and how much I love her. I just handed her the notebook I wrote it in and left to give her space, and people of reddit,  20min later she came and found me and threw her arms around me and said she needed that and loved me, and actually cheered up for the rest of the evening. I know she's still hurt, but seeing her shine through it made me so glad that was the approach I went with. Also, reaffirmed how undeserving K is of my cheys friendship and loyalty. I would hate for that nasty little conniving shit-friend-bein-a-hole dull my daughters shine. I know this turned into a huge vent-o-rama guys, but I needed it, so if you made it this far, ty & goodnight. \n\nAlso, on the off chance Chey or K come across this post; Chey, I love you, we ride or die. And K, you ain't s***.",

Is there an age where you start talking to them about things? What exactly are you saying or doing with them?",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "- making sure to never talk poorly about myself in front of them. Not only do they emulate you, they also likely share some features with you. If you speak poorly about the size of your own stomach or the color of your own skin, they're bound to think poorly of themselves when they notice they're similar\n- making sure not to speak poorly about others appearances for all the same reasons \n- occasionally taking the time to say \"I like your _\" and \"I like my _\" and I try to use unexpected features. My son is constantly complimented on his blue eyes but I'll occasionally tell him I like his nose, tummy, or feet too. I try to also find parts of my own body to be proud of in front of him\n- reading books featuring a variety of bodies and complimenting them, sometimes generally \"she's so pretty\" and sometimes specifically \"I like her cool hair!\"\n\nHopefully all of this is planting the seeds of bodily acceptance while he's young and hopefully he'll at least be less compromised when puberty hits. I think we all lose a little self-esteem at that age though. So much acne, weird hair, etc. all while suddenly caring *so much* about what our peers think, plus I think those early puberty years are where most of us faced our meanest bullies. I think some insecurities are inevitable but hopefully we can start them on the right foot. \n\nI'm not sure exactly what my strategy will be with all the puberty stuff though, my son's still only a toddler now. I'll definitely avoid personally criticizing him, but if he ever expresses upset about his own appearance, I don't plan to immediately contradict him either with like \"nooo! You're so handsome! Don't say that!\" I feel like that doesn't help either. My mother was this way about everything, I was never allowed to critique anything about myself and honestly I think it was the wrong strategy. It never made me feel better, I never believed her, and to this day I find it hard to believe any compliment from her is genuine because she's always insisted I was amazing at things that I definitely wasn't. So I think when he reaches that age, I'll probably go with primarily listening. Letting him just vent to me, and helping him deal with those insecurities in healthy ways. Like if he's ever upset about his weight or maybe how muscular he is, I don't mind buying healthier food or helping him with an exercise program, but stepping in if it ever gets to an unhealthy situation. I might look for a therapist too even if it doesn't get unhealthy. I don't know, I wish I knew the way to get him to 100% accept his body but does anyone fully accept themselves? I do think most people are *more* accepting of their bodies in adulthood so maybe it's just a matter of getting through those teen years with minimal damage.",

Two years ago, he was charged with sexually abusing both of them on the weekends when he had custody. It probably started when they were 3 and 4 and went on until they had the words to tell their mom what was happening, about a year later, possibly more.\u00a0\n\nHe was jailed but let out on bond, eventually plead guilty and part of his plea deal was his name was not added to the sex offender registry. I have learned that it is terrifyingly common. He is adamant he didn\u2019t do anything and his now fighting for custody of his children and they have supervised weekly visitation with him. His family and friends are all on his side and believe my friend is lying to keep her kids away from him. My friend has been doing everything she can to keep her kids safe from him, but there is a real danger that he could gain partial custody of them again.\u00a0\n\nSo here is the issue.

This friend is someone I trust wholeheartedly and to this point, hers has been the only house I let my daughter spend the night at.\u00a0\n\nI recently got my daughter (8) a Gabb Watch and over this past weekend, she and the older sister talked to each other all weekend long on their watches.\u00a0\n\nMy friend is currently studying to get her BA and was studying for a big test over the weekend so a lot of the time that the girls were talking, they were unsupervised. At one point, the older sister was laughing because the younger one was trying to pull down her underwear and she was fighting her off to make her stop. I overheard this part and realized that my best friend\u2019s house may no longer be a safe place to allow my kids to sleep over.\u00a0\n\nNext month, both girls are having their birthday party (their birthdays are a week apart) and my 2 kids (8F and 4M) were going to spend the night. It would be my son\u2019s first sleepover and the girls are already planning it all.\u00a0\n\nSince realizing that this house may no longer be a safe place for a sleepover, I have been fretting all weekend on how to broach this subject.

We both have new partners and have been 100% done with each other before we even decided to split. We have a 9 year old daughter that we have 50/50 week on week off custody. Our coparenting relationship has been pretty good and we had a pretty open line of communication until he got with his girlfriend.\n\nMy ex has been with his gf for a year now. She is 10 years younger than him and moved in within weeks of them getting together. When he first got with her, he asked my opinion on her being the primary person to pick our daughter up from school. I told him that if he has no other choice but her, it's fine. But since she was so new, I didn't feel comfortable with her jumping into the step mom role immediately. I told him I had nothing against her and I hope she will fill that role in the future, but it was too early in the relationship for that. I think my response ruined any chance of having a friendly relationship with his girlfriend. \n\nMultiple times at drop off his gf has physically pulled him away from me while I was discussing our daughter. She's also done things to try to get his attention away from me and our daughter. I don't know why she acts this way towards me. I've never done anything inappropriate. Our conversations are 99% about our daughter. And occasionally we might have extremely short conversations about other things. Like he sent me a link on a new game he figured I'd like. I told him news about a celebrity he was a fan of. But those conversations happen maybe a few times a year. \n\nSince getting with her, he often ignores my messages. Like my nephew had a birthday party during his visitation week. I had to ask him 3x for him to respond if he would like to take her or if I could take her. He didn't respond until the night before the party. I've asked him questions on his opinion on having the sex talk or our stance on monitoring online activity. He just leaves me on read. \n\nThen one time we had an issue with her Nintendo account.  He set it up originally and we needed him to reset the password. It became a lot more complicated than we thought, including us having to call Nintendo. And we had to message him several times to get it resolved. He informed us that his girlfriend was mad at him/us because they were trying to relax and watch a show and we kept interrupting. Like I know it was his week off but I kinda feel like he's still a parent. And being a parent means you get interrupted a lot. But I don't know, maybe I need to stop bothering him?",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "You are not being an annoying co parent, and he obviously lets his gf pettiness influence his co parenting. You have limited choices here, and they can create drama with her, and through her, with him.\n\nYou should adress the attitude to him with examples, be as concrete as possible, and tell him you can live with it but it will affect his relation with his daughter. \n\nExample ; his late response to the birthday party directly affect her and her opportunity to participate with her cousins. This is disrespectful to your daughter and from now on you will tell your daughter facts when his actions affects her.\n\nYou can also tell him you are being cordial and trying to set a good example with your daughter, you have a choice;you could go low contact and demand that all communication go through an co parent app. Then it will be obvious when he disrespect communication and ignores requests regarding your daughters life. And you could try to communicate and stick to the agreement and routines that worked so well previously. His choice, his consequenses.\n\nIt is a fact that when two people create a child they are forever in a position to have to deal with eachother for the best for their child. Not doing so will always affect the child.\n\nBeing parents are not a sprint it\u2019s a marathon.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to love eachother to co parent, but you do have to respect eachother, be cordial and work on good communication. \n\nIt is important to remember you do this for the child. New gf and bf should also respect this. They are not the childs parent, but they can, with the right frame of mind, still have a good relationship with the child.\n\nJealousy, pettiness and immaturity does not go well in this type of relation.\n\nYour ex should be aware of that, and be conscious about his priorities.\n\nWe have plenty of Reddit stories about how children of divorces are impacted when new partners force their opinions and beliefs into their partners co parenting.\n\nSo to end this , you are NTA.\n\nBut it seems communication is no longer good.",

        "content": "I am sooooo sorry in advance for the length of this post, but I\u2019m an over-sharer and I feel like details matter. \n\nMy daughter will be 11 in January, and has been in the beginning stages of puberty for most of the past two years. Her pediatrician had estimated that her period would arrive within 18ish months about 18 months ago. \ud83d\ude2c Not only does she have awful body odor, she begs to shave her armpits at least once a week, she has a ton of discharge, acne like woah, her boobs are bigger than some adult women and much bigger than any other girl in her grade (she\u2019s thin so it\u2019s not extra weight), and she\u2019s already asking if she can do something about her pubic hair. \ud83e\udd74\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI hate two of her friends. They are disrespectful little sh*ts who don\u2019t come from the most respectable families - Please note that I am no saint. I have tattoos, I love wine, and I \u201cgarden\u201d, or whatever the kids are saying now, almost every night after my kids go to sleep. But I\u2019m also a productive member of society, just turned 39, never been an addict or incarcerated. I\u2019m not normally a judgy beach, but these girls have ridiculously wild family lives. And they are the most obnoxious little girls I have ever met. Anyway, I limit the amount of time she\u2019s able to spend with them, but she\u2019s in school with them and they\u2019re both on her bus as well. A couple weeks ago, I saw a notification pop up on my phone from the Meta VR app. The app is on my phone because I set the VR up for my daughter, and having zero experience with a VR, I had no idea how much one could do on a VR. So, the first notification was one of these little jerks messaging my daughter through the VR. It was just an \u201cs\u201d, so I clicked on it. As soon as the app pulled up, two more messages came through \u2026 \u201ce\u201d and then \u201cx\u201d. I deleted them with the quickness, but obviously my daughter sees this girl everyday at school, so I\u2019m sure there were other conversations. \n\nAlso note that my daughter and I have weekly chats where I ask her about school, her relationships with her teacher and peers, we talk about how she\u2019s been feeling and where her head is at that week, etc. I consistently remind her that I will always be her safe space and that she can always talk to me about ANYTHING. I have also said things about how I know kids talk about stuff and that if she ever has any questions about something she hears, I encourage her to come to me instead of just rolling with the dumb stuff 5th grade kids think they know. Moral to this story is that I try to ensure she knows that I have her back and she never has to feel scared to talk to me. \n\nShe generally doesn\u2019t ask me questions and never admits to being told anything. I believe she \u201cknows\u201d more than she\u2019ll admit to me, but I also want to assume she\u2019s still my naive little baby! \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd1e\n\nPoint to this post and I guess what my question really is \u2026\u2026 When did you talk to your kids/daughters about sex and/or detailed puberty? How old were they? What did you tell them? How far into detail did you go? \n\nI feel like if I try to explain a very basic, simplified version of it all, she\u2019s going to ask follow up questions and I won\u2019t know how to answer her without telling her everything. She\u2019s my first and it was just her and I for over 5 years. I would LOVE for her to know nothing for the next 3-20 years, but I know that\u2019s impossible in these times. But with how developed she already is, it scares the \ud83d\udca9 out of me that she doesn\u2019t know that child predators exist. I mean, she knows there are bad people who kidnap and kill, but she\u2019s not paying attention to the Chesters lurking. \n\nI feel crazy and my thoughts are all over the place, so please excuse me for not sounding like a functional adult. I\u2019m just so not ready for this!!!! I thought I had at least 3 more years. \ud83e\udd74\ud83d\ude2d Luckily #2 is a boy! \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\n\nThank you in advance for your advice here!

(Like since I was a toddler) I definitely grew up in a time where parental figures didn't see an issue with it aha \ud83d\ude05. My 11 year old has expressed quite a lot of interest in watching true crime. At this point I've let her watch one episode of unsolved mysteries. After the episode we had quite a long discussion about who she thinks it was, and how sad she was for the victim and her family. It was a very productive discussion. She's quite mature, and her reasoning for wanting to watch it is to see criminals be brought to justice, and seeing closure for victims families etc. I'm still not comfortable with showing her those docs with very gruesome photos, or any talk of sexual assault/rape. My question is how to navigate these things, do I let her watch some more true crime? (Very selectively and I would watch it first to make sure the content isn't focused on the things I don't want her to see) she wants to be a forensic pathologist currently when she grows up saying \"I know it would he a hard job but i think it would be so rewarding to help families get justice\" \nI would love to hear other parents stories on how they go through this. \nJust for more context she is allowed to watch some horror movies with me (again I fully watch them beforehand and make sure there is no sex or nudity or anything I don't feel comfortable with showing her) we also started by watching behind the scenes of some horror movies to see how they're made. She is not scared of the movies we've watched at all.  \nThanks for everyone's opinions!\nPlease no rude comments, I do understand every child is different and some cannot handle these things, which is why I would never let my other daughter watch the same.\nI do truly feel she has a good head on her shoulders and would be able to handle things well.

        "content": "I have a 4 year old daughter from a previous relationship that ended almost 4 years ago. I was with her father for almost 4 years on and off. It was an abusive relationship verbally and sometimes physically (only when he was he drunk) I sincerely believe he has a drinking problem. I started defending myself towards the end. We ended due to him cheating and lying (it got old) I left him when my daughter was 4 months. I bought a house 3 months later and never looked back. I always felt like he held me back in life. When she was a baby I asked for him to send me $300 a month for formula/diapers/etc. he only sent me $200 in 6/7 MONTHS. I decided to put him on child support and was granted to receive more than $600 monthly. Anyways he is still behind almost 10K\u2026. That\u2019s not my main argument\u2026 \nWe never had any visitation orders from a judge, but we agreed to Sundays. From morning to evening. She did sleep over some days and I would pack her clothes and pajamas (which I shouldn\u2019t have to because he should have clothes for her but I did it because she\u2019s my daughter and I think of her needs always) when I would pick her up the next day she would be in the same change of clothes from the morning before!! So she slept in the same clothes. And the clothes were dirty and  her hair was always undone, he has a girlfriend (I liked her and still do but we are no longer on speaking terms) and I asked him maybe she can do her hair or just do a ponytail it\u2019s not that hard. It was a cycle so I eventually ended sleep overs. \nIn May I FaceTimed him to see my daughter because I\u2019m always worried about her\u2026 and I saw a beer in his cup holder while he was driving. On the highway! I remained calm and as soon as I got off of work I picked her up and didn\u2019t mention anything to him until the next day. And he admitted to it and said that it was an old beer from the day prior. (I don\u2019t believe that) fast forward to June he dropped off my daughter drunk\u2026 his cheeks were flushed and  he was slurring his words. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. I didn\u2019t want to argue in front of my daughter so I went inside and texted him immediately asking him why is he drinking and driving with my daughter and he finally admits to drinking at a baseball game. I\u2019m just tired of always being worried for my daughter\u2019s safety. So my daughter hasn\u2019t seen him since. He\u2019s reached out 3/4 times since June but I haven\u2019t responded. In his texts he calls me an as$h0l3. He never takes any accountability of his actions. NEVER. I don\u2019t know what to do. Do I wait and see if he takes me to court? Do I get a lawyer? I\u2019ve spoken to a lawyer and he said I can\u2019t keep her away from him. But like what the fuck I don\u2019t want anything to happen to her!! Her life means everything to me. I really think he\u2019s a piece of shit and maybe he\u2019ll give up. I don\u2019t care about money, I can support my daughter 100% her safety is more important than anything. \nI am married now (almost a year married) and have a beautiful life with my partner and my daughter loves my wife and vise versa. We wish she can one day adopt her but I don\u2019t know if a judge will ever grant that since it\u2019s a same sex marriage.

He was raised in a conservative Christian household while I was not. \n\nFor whatever reason we continue to have discussions about future issues. (Maybe I should avoid these discussions?) I've obviously figured out that he's definitely the conservative father. Tonight we talked about how he won't let our girls dress \"too extreme\" in any direction when they're older. He expects tshirts and shorts/jeans from them. No crop tops, no cheerleading outfits, no short skirts, and no goth/skater clothes. He says all of these extremes are signs of a mental problem and would be the girls screaming for help. Or a cry for attention \n\nI was a \"skater\" girl and when he sees pictures he'll make comments that you can really tell I was damaged. I was abused growing up, so yes he's right. \n\nWe've also had short discussions because he talks down about transgender and gay individuals. He says he doesn't feel they're any less of people and deserve respect, but also that they need mental health help. Says it's \"gender disphoria.\" I remind him to watch how he talks because the girls will one day pick up on the language and I don't want them to internalize his opinion. He will also use derogatory language when talking about women who have high body counts. I don't want them to tie their worth to their bodies. And I want them to feel okay talking to me if they are gay or trans, because I want to help them and support them.\n\nWe're on the same page about sex ed because neither of us waited for marriage and want the girls to have accurate sex ed. And thankfully he doesn't have the conservative Christian beliefs he was brought up with. We were teens and did dumb things like snuck out, drank, etc. We both have the opinion we'd rather have trust than sneaking around, it's just building the trust beginning now. \n\nBut I don't know how to get him to understand that the way he thinks could damage our girls. Yes, I realize I should have thought about this all before having kids but honestly it didn't feel like a big deal. Everyone around us thinks like him, I am the odd one out.

Then my son says, his friend's dad actually had the Watchmen for them to watch originally, but my son refused because he knew it was on the list of movies I had said he couldn\u2019t watch until he was much older. He\u2019s a mature kid for his age, and has watched through Lord of the rings, the Harry Potters, etc., and done well with it, but there are limits with all things.\n\nSo I\u2019m proud of my son for standing his ground, but I\u2019m a little in shock about the friends dad\u2018s movie choice. The Watchmen has a lot of gratuitous violence, sexuality, and even a rape scene, which is so far beyond what is appropriate for a 9 or 10 year old I don\u2019t know how he even considered it. my son barely knows what sex is, I\u2019m not sure I want to have his first onscreen experience of it being rape....\n\nSo, confront the dad, or simply be a little more choosy about which movie nights I send my kid out to? On the flipside I\u2019m almost glad my son was there, because there was a couple of other fairly sensitive kids at that group who I think would\u2019ve been traumatized and would not have been adamant in refusing to watch it.",

        "content": "I am very conflicted about this situation. I have to kids an 11 year old boy and a 9 year old girl. They take the bus to school everyday. \n\nLast year a neighbor of our 11year old girl accused my son of calling her the B word, her parents came to our house and I made my son apologize and I punished him with taking away electronics for a month plus other chores. Later on I found out that the reason he called her that was because my daughter (2 years younger with a speech problem that affected her reading and writing) decided to write her friends on the bus saying how much they mean to her and the 11 year old took one look at it and gave it back to my daughter and told her that she doesn\u2019t want it because everything is spelled wrong and it\u2019s embarrassing. My son seeing this and seeing his sister about to cry told her that she was being a bitch. I congratulate him for standing up for his sister but kept the punishments because he shouldn\u2019t use that language and we moved on. \n\nThen the day after this new school year I get a call from school that the same little girl and her parents had accused my son of making her uncomfortable and making sexual remarks. The parent requested for her to be moved from the class they now shared. I apologies to the parents because I have a daughter and I would have reacted the same way if my daughter told me this. The counselor started her own investigation by watching from a distance and it turns out that all the boys in the bus where talking about it not just my son and that my son didn\u2019t really interact with the girl just with their mutual friends. I also found out that the boy who was starting all the sexual conversations was the 11 year olds \u201cboyfriend\u201d and she was upset that they were not in the same class this year, yet my son was the only one of the boys who was in her class and after she complained they moved her to her Boyfriend class. Again I let it go because I had no real prof and my son did tell me that they were talking about sexual things on the bus. I sat him down, had the sex talk and decided for him to get a bit of counseling just in case. \n\nNow for the reason of this post. My daughter came home crying yesterday because the 11 year old called her ugly and made fun of her speech on the bus, there where 3 other kids there sitting next to them. I talked to to the kids first with their parents there and the told me the same story my kids did. I finally went to talk to the parents and the mom\u2019s response was \u201cmy daughter is a kind and loving person who tries to encourage others and makes them feel welcome. That doesn\u2019t sound like something she would do\u201d. I explained that there were other kids who witnessed it and my daughter is also a kind and loving person who would have no reason to cry and make this up. \n\nShe responded with \u201cwell my daughter said that your kids just got upset because they lost a game and that her daughter is so nice that she even hugged my son after the bitch incident because when he was apologizing he started to cry\u201d. \n\nI told her that my kids are not perfect but at least my kids never lied when they were accused of things and they took responsibility for their actions. Both times I confronted them with the accusations they admitted it right away. \n \nI have really bad anxiety paranoia and ADHD. confrontation is so bad for me that I try to avoid it at all cost and I have become a people pleaser. My therapist suggested doing things that I know is right even when my head is creaming at me to lock myself in my house and never come out. I been taking baby step and this one was one of them. I knew I needed to stand up for my kids but everything in me is making me feel guilty and like I did something wrong. At the same time it also feels like that\u2019s not enough because nothing is going to get resolved. I was thinking of maybe asking to see if they can ride a different bus but my kids best friends also ride that bus and I don\u2019t want them to feel like they did anything wrong. \n\nI feel like maybe I\u2019m being punished for not being able to control my emotions and that my kids are better off if they had a different mom. I\u2019m sorry for any spelling mistakes, I haven\u2019t slept since this happened.",

This is also going to be long- I sincerely appreciate any words of advice or feedback. \n\nMy life absolutely exploded at the beginning of this summer when at 8 weeks pregnant I caught my husband snapchatting a coworker inappropriately. Devastated doesn't even begin to describe how I felt, but he swore it was just an emotional affair and wanted to work on things. We started marriage counseling and I have tried so hard to work on things with us. Problem is he never tried, and I kept suspecting that he was talking to either the same woman or another woman because he kept being extremely sketchy with his phone. \n\nLast night everything exploded when I confronted him again and he finally confessed, after me begging him for 5 minutes in tears to be honest with me, that he is texting another woman. Not the original woman, but a different one who is apparently across the country from us. He wouldn't let me look at the messages but he told me that he talked to her about our marriage, said some really cruel and awful things. He also said he is in a sexting relationship with her. \n\nHe is done with our marriage. He says that he has no hope for us, that he didn't feel marriage counseling helped at all, he has no motivation to work on us or try to remain married. He fell out of love with me, and he is so disconnected from me that he said he couldn't care less if I went and slept with someone else. It is shocking to hear this because up until this point he has remained consistent in saying that he hopes we can work it out, that he wants to work on our marriage. He has been having sex with me regularly. He has been committed to marriage counseling. This was mind-blowing to hear this. \n\nI am so shell shocked and in disbelief I feel like I am barely functioning today. I couldn't sleep all night as my brain is racing with thoughts of things like -what do I do about health insurance? I am on his health insurance! -how do i bear splitting Christmas with him and my daughter and unborn baby?\n\nSomething I am incredibly torn about is if I should kick him right out (the house is in my name), or if I should talk to him about staying in our house and living \"separated\" for now. The truth is, he committed to being a father- he was on board with conceiving this baby. I won't be able to lift my toddler at all because I will be having a c-section. It's not fair for me to be alone with a newborn and toddler and get no sleep while he is living peacefully somewhere else. Not only this but him leaving is going to destroy me financially. I can't afford our house, I can't afford to live or buy groceries or anything without his income. Him staying in the house might buy us some time to figure this out. He committed to being a father, I will need help. \n\nI am just so incredibly lost. Has anyone else evert divorced pregnant or with a toddler? how does life move on?",

(She was 5150\u2019d) after another violent fight with her 2nd ex husband and took a bunch of pills. Ex is a felon and has addiction issues (crack & alcohol) and is a trigger for their mom (theres been multiple DV calls to their home where mom is the aggressor)\n\nShe chose 3 supervisors, but actually only has 1 now (she didn\u2019t have 1 fill out paperwork (fought with her sister who made the initial 911 call, got into a fight with the other) and now is telling the children it\u2019s me and their dad\u2019s fault she can\u2019t see them. \n\nHe has offered to meet up in a public place with the kids but mom refuses calling him controlling and accuses him (and me) of being on a power trip. \n\nThe kids finally have stability, expectations and consequences. They are doing really well but I know they miss their mom and younger sibs (mom has 2 more kids with the second ex)\n\nCustody used to be 50/50 (alternating days and alternate weekends) but the guardian ad litem and both attorneys came up with the current custody agreement.\n\nMom is escalating and her mental health issues are getting worse. She is very aggressive towards us ( I understand her being upset but at some point she has to realize that this isn\u2019t our fault)\n\nSadly, she began a custody battle back last year making false allegations of mental and verbal abuse by me toward the children and of physical abuse by their dad and she was trying to get sole custody but the tables have turned drastically for her. \n\nWe had a Guardian Ad Litem appointed to investigate and her report has kept getting delayed due to her overloaded schedule. \n\nMom is constantly sending nasty messages with threats to tell the \u201ccommunity\u201d that dad is a rapist and sex addict (all false claims) which speaks to her mental health status. \n\nThere\u2019s so many more details but that should give a little bit of background\n\nThis is her bday weekend and we wanted to have the kids take over breakfast and presents for their mom and baby sister who also has the same bday. We want to have the kids have a relationship with their mom but she really needs to be mentally stable and not keep bringing her ex around her most recent claims are that he\u2019s not an addict but is sober (she claims he\u2019s 2 months sober but told us he was just 2 weeks sober when she was hospitalized and left him in charge of the younger kids she has with him.) Point being she\u2019s trying to keep him around and justify having him around my stepkids. There is a clause in their parenting agreement about lot allowing addicts or those in recovery/rehab around but she defied that many times.  Mom also has a criminal felony charge that she plead down because she assaulted a stranger and keyed her car over a parking spot. \n\nWe want the kids to be in therapy but mom refuses to consent. \n\nWe are trying my best to help the kids process and are just giving them a loving and caring environment. We\u2019re just concerned about them and how the few times they have seen their mom or spoken with her, the kids are very dysregulated and shook up. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this and how do we help support the kids (and eventually mom when she\u2019s ready)?\n\nWe don\u2019t know what will be decided for permanent custody-our next court date is late October but can\u2019t imagine it being restored to the previous set up.",

Also our dog was not doing well a month ago, he has since passed. And I didn't want the babies around my son's bday in June.\n\nShe had me have sex with her on her period and said it would be fine don't worry about it, still breastfeeding as well, ran out of condoms. I succumbed. Then around the 16th we had a wedding and she said I think I'm pregnant and I just took it on the chin for the sake of it. We also went on vacation for three days after 6 hour ride there and back.Since then I got a job where I can make IL happen so timing is essential. Now for the past 5 days she keeps saying she's not pregnant and got negative tests. \n\nYesterday I got yelled at in the morning because I left my phone on the cutting board. Put me in a mood all day. I do mornings and nights with my son every weekday and all day saturday. She does during the day when I work and sundays.

Then I'm like let's talk about the baby thing. I said I'm nervous about it to so that's why my mood has been a little bad. And she bursts saying she knows and that she needs reassurance and that Ive said it enough and that he or she will grow with me resenting them. I was just like shocked and didn't say anything and now we haven't talked all day.\n\nI did to her defense say she took my sperm on the vacation. My son was laying on her stomach and said say hey to your little brother or sister which triggered me. I know it's a horrible thing to say but she was getting at me. I apologized then and said I was joking and reconfirmed that now isn't really the time with everything going on but I'd do anything for my family.\n\nI realize she is on a clock and that I was a dick, but there is just so much stress I'm dealing with right now and I just need time to move there and sell the house.

Not that I won\u2019t let my significant other talk to them about it, but you get me, being that I\u2019ve gotten so used to doing everything on my own I feel like it\u2019s my job. He\u2019s great with my boys, but I will say that he had a tough upbringing. He just told me that when the time is right, he will buy them condoms. End of story. So I was like NO, that is not how it should be. \n\nRecently, my oldest (m12) has been showing interest in girls (in music videos, he kinda stares and makes comments when he finds them attractive). I don\u2019t want to be too forward and maybe make him uncomfortable by talking about it but it\u2019s necessary, right? My parents never spoke to me about sex or what I would feel when puberty hit so I felt lost and ended up taken advantage of many times. I don\u2019t want my boys to go through the same. I can\u2019t even begin to understand how boys feel at that age so I\u2019m asking for advice. \n\nWhat is age appropriate for boys to learn about sex from their parents? And right after the talk, do we get them condoms? \n\nThank you in advance. \n\nUpdate: thank you so much for all the great advice, it helped me tremendously. \nA little background on my son, he was diagnosed with mild autism, ADHD and ODD. He is a great kid to say the least, very social but also very shy. He is very handsome and always jokes about how girls love him and how good he always smells. \nWhen he was 8 years old, he walked in on me changing and afterwards straight up asked me why my body was different, why do women carry the  babies (he was impressed when he found out that male seahorses are the ones to give birth lol) and why/how do women have breasts and produce milk. I answered each question the best way I could and moved on from it. I never made it a conversation but whenever he asked, I answered. Now that he turned 12, he finds himself feeling a bit confused about his interests. He plays soccer, is in a book club and also wants to try out for basketball this year. All his \u201cfriends\u201d have girlfriends and obviously have access to anything through their phones. I check his messages every now and then to see if there\u2019s anything to be worried about but I\u2019ve never found anything. He did tell me that one of his friends showed him an adult site on various occasions and while he was curious about it, he says he felt \u201cweird\u201d. Anyway, we spoke a little after I posted this and he thanked me for being a cool mom lol (that made my mom heart beat faster) \nI\u2019m hoping he trusts me enough to talk to me whenever. As for the condoms, I\u2019ll keep them in the house for when the time comes. I had friends back in the day who were 11,12 and 13 just doing the most to feel like adults and ended up with unplanned pregnancies.

Then there\u2019s her peers; she is constantly involving herself with major professions of \u201ctrue love\u201d with several people at one time, including some random strangers from the Internet. Several of which she shared her location with, and one \u201c19 year-old\u201d from across the state she was planning on sneaking out of the house with. (I shut that last one down personally and told them if I even caught a whiff of him on the breeze I was calling the cops). \n\nDue to all these lapses in judgement and acting out, she\u2019s gone days, then a week, then weeks at a time, and finally months on restriction (no devices, limited freedoms), been suspended from school multiple times, been sent to temporary \u201ctimeout school\u201d twice, and so on.    \n\nTo everyone: Us, her grandparents, therapists, friends, teachers, counselors, etc. she says one thing, but her actions tell a *completely* different story. \n\nShe long said her main issue is that she feels she\u2019s being unfairly persecuted as her siblings don\u2019t \u201cever get their stuff taken away for weeks or months.\u201d But I can\u2019t seem to make her understand that them yelling and slamming a door because they\u2019re being told it\u2019s bed time is a *far cry* from her engaging a random adult to come meet her in the middle of the night and \u201chang out\u201d (after she\u2019s been spoken to by both her parents and her therapist about this specific thing). \n\nShe\u2019s now started HS. It\u2019s literally been just a couple weeks, but since then: she\u2019s come home wasted on weed, got busted smoking cigarettes and vaping multiple times, has made plans to run away (which I only interrupted due to her suspicious activities that day) along with plans to have unprotected sex with the person she was running away with\u2026 she\u2019s *still* talking to *multiple* boys\u2026 and with each using that over-dramatic \u201cI love you and *only you* and we\u2019ll be together forever\u201d tack, and yesterday she had made plans for another 19 y/o (also one of the \u201cI love you forever\u201d fellows) to meet her at the bus stop on the way home, so they could hang out and do god knows what. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m at the very end of a rope that\u2019s wrapped in a live wire, so last night, I told her that all of this has to *stop.*\n\n1. That, if she continues with this crap, tries to run away (or does run away), especially with one of her \u201cknights in shining armor,\u201d I *promise* I\u2019m going to put her on blast and forward all the loving messages she\u2019s sending around to these different guys to the other ones, so they can see who she really is. \n\n2. That, if she continues to smoke, vape, take drugs, has or tries to have unprotected sex, and otherwise \u201cact\u201d like a grown-up, she\u2019s going to have see the other side of adulthood\u2026 and do chores, get good grades, follow rules, etc. in order to \u201cpay\u201d for her rent, electricity, food, clothes, WiFi, etc. (Of course I\u2019d still provide her with a bare minimum of nutrition and housing, but anything else besides that, would have to be earned.)\n\n3. Lastly, if she\u2019s insistent on making toxic, love triangles, quadrilaterals, hexagons or whatever, and *especially* if she\u2019s caught talking to random dudes on the internet: She and I are going to spar. Every day. I will not use my full strength, (though I told her that if it makes her feel better she can feel free to do so to me). I\u2019ll just use trips grapples and similar stuff. My reasoning for that is since she seems hell bent on constantly involving herself in situations where some schmuck might attack or try to hurt her out of jealousy or rage, she might as well experience a tiny bot of what that\u2019s like, while learning some skills to protect herself. \n\nI admit I was *really* at my wits\u2019 end, angry, scared and defeated when I went on this tirade, and now I\u2019m wondering if it was all a bit too much. \n\nMy wife is just as out of ideas and I think we might need some perspective. I will totally walk whatever I need to from above back, but literally nothing has worked. Not multiple therapists, psychiatrists, long talks, sharing my own experiences and mistakes, hugs and love, yelling and screaming, listening, staying involved, consequences, clean slates/restarts. \n\nI\u2019m just terrified we\u2019re going to lose her to the darkness and then she\u2019s gonna take me with her.",

She can be more reckless than you can be controlling.  That's true for all teenagers.  Your ability to affect her behavior is getting smaller and smaller every day.  \n\nBut again, this isn't normal run of the mill teenager stuff.

        "content": "Hey all, \nI really need a non-biased space to vent right now as I\u2019m having a hard time coping with my situation. \n\nFor some context I am 20f and my daughter\u2019s father is 21m. My daughter is 10 months and I\u2019ve done everything myself, pregnancy, birth, raising her. \nMy babies dad (I\u2019m gonna refer to him as Jay) has been an addict since before I was pregnant. He currently uses cocaine, percs, and lean as far as I know. We dated previously for a year or so then split and had no contact for close to 2 years. I unblocked him and we began seeing eachother again. We had no intentions of being together, more so just a hook up situation. We weren\u2019t careful whatsoever and had unprotected sex regularly. I\u2019m not on any form of birth control and haven\u2019t been since I was 16. \nNeedless to say, of course I ended up pregnant. I had a traumatizing abortion previously which was also Jays child. I\u2019m not gonna go into detail but after that I decided I didn\u2019t want another abortion ever again and I made that clear to him. \nI didn\u2019t want to get pregnant but told him if it happened I would keep it. \nHe said he wasn\u2019t ready to be a dad but that it was my choice. \nI told him I was keeping it and that I would do it alone until he was ready. \nI know I made terrible choices but I can\u2019t change what\u2019s happened I can only make better ones moving forward.\nI don\u2019t regret having my daughter whatsoever but I do wish I\u2019d never gotten myself into a position of having to choose in the first place. With a guy who I knew wasn\u2019t stable enough to be a dad anytime soon.\n\nThe part that eats me up the most is that when we were dating, i pressured him into trying blow with me for the first time together. He was very hesitant and repeatedly told me he didn\u2019t want to. I didn\u2019t want to do it alone and pushed him until he agreed. He\u2019s been doing it ever since. I was 17 and he was 18 at the time. I\u2019ve apologized countless times but the guilt of what I made him do eats me alive. It\u2019s one of my biggest regrets. Ya, maybe he would\u2019ve gotten into it on his own eventually but he might not of. And that\u2019s what hurts the most. I blame myself and I deserve the blame. This is why I\u2019m not mad at him and I don\u2019t hold resentment towards him. I only resent myself, rightfully so.\n\n\nFast forward to now, Jay has agreed to pay $250 in child support once he gets a new job. He told me he was fired from his last job and is looking for a new one. I really appreciate the money and him trying to support her to the best of his ability. \nHe\u2019s told me he can\u2019t be in her life until he\u2019s clean because he doesn\u2019t want drugs anywhere near her and I agree with this. He said he\u2019s trying and I know it\u2019s hard. \nEveryday I\u2019m worried that he\u2019s dead, that he\u2019s OD\u2019d or taken his life. I want to help him so badly but I don\u2019t know how. We live in Canada, if anyone has any resources please feel free to link some. I want him to be better for our daughter so badly. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if he dies and everyday I\u2019m sick to my stomach wondering if today\u2019s the day.",

You need to get your daughter away from him. He will only get better when he decides to get better on his own. He will drag you down with him in his current state. You and your daughter don\u2019t deserve that. My honest advice? Cut contact and look into finding an r/alanon meeting near you. Sorry you are going through this. Hope he decides to go get better one day, for your sake and his daughters.",

        "content": "Just as the title says. So story time: I have a boy, 2yo at the moment. The moment I learned he was a boy, I was DETERMINED to be as much gender neutral as posible. Like obsessed. I've never bought any \"boyish\" clothes (I hate that they even do different clothes for babies, like can't a girl like dinosaurs??? I did!), his toys where mainly wooden cute toys and, again, gender neutral. He has only watched Miss Rachel and Bluey on TV so no gender stereotypes. \nAnd ... Guess what... He ias a boy boy!!! He loves balls, trains, cars, airplanes, and dinosaurs/dragons. It's funny because we saw a dragon figure (a folklore thing where I live) on the street one day a few months ago and since then he is in love (more like obsessed). He loves swords and guns but they are not allowed in our house.\nI was like, alright, maybe I will feel better if he also plays with other things? Nophe. He's got a kitchen and can play with it but gets bored in a blink. I tried babies but he ends up just throwing them on the ground and fighting with them. \nHe does LOVE cleaning and he has a cute cleaning set but I refuse to call it a \"girl\" thing even when it looks like they are market as girl toys (also, he is obsessed with his daddy who does the majority of the cleaning so I guess thats were the thing comes from)\nDisclaimer: I respect what he likes, my house is increasingly looking like jurassic park. I'm just curious about that because before being a mom I thought those were learned behaviours and if I didn't expose my kid willingly to those \"boyish\" things he'd like other things. I refused to believe there was some genetic thing or whatever. But apparently I was wrong. I don't know what to thing anymore! So what sre your experiences??\nEDIT: I'm not crying about my boy gravitating towards \"\"\"boy\"\"\" things. I have always questioned gender stereotypes (as I believe sex and gender are different things) and I was SO SURE that if a kid was exposed to all different kind of stuff and kept away from such stereotypes their likings were going to be diverse (like playing with cars but also dolls, as I did). I just find it really funny that my intended  \"gender neutral kid\" has turned into a really macho kid. That's all. I recently bought him a really ugly jurassic park school bag instead of the pastel blue one that I wanted to buy because he was just sooooo excited when he saw it. Because the whole point of erradicating gender stereotypes is to let kids play with whatever they want regardless of their gender/sex. So he can play with whatever he wants (I draw the line at things that shouldnt be made into toys like guns).",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Just chill. Human behavior is not mathematical. There\u2019s nothing wrong with liking dinosaurs, trains, or any other interests beyond what you offer them.

During her whole pregnancy I struggled with watching her struggle and fall into depression with her body. Not knowing what to do she\u2019s not a very physical wanting person when upset so I would try to uplift her thru words or flowers or spontaneous dates and things I know she would like. Helped fund her hobbies, because I let her quit her job when we found out so I\u2019ve been paying all the bills and putting food on the table since then. Now it\u2019s worse she is having emotional breakdowns everyday multiple times a day is honestly very closed off to me even though all I do is help some days are great the bad days are terrible. Thing is , I do EVERYTHING I make sure she doesn\u2019t have to do anything at all , I know staying home with a newborn isn\u2019t the easiest task in the world but I work Monday thru Friday and wake up at 5am to go to work outside in the heat all day, I stay up late at night do all the feedings make sure she gets plenty of rest and recovery . While I am drowning getting no sleep ever. Coming home from work to dirty everything , I get PPD and all that but it\u2019s so hard to completely do everything I come home wash bottles feed the baby do laundry clean the house top to bottom. Do her laundry mine the babies. Go shopping for dinner cook dinner clean the dishes pay all the bills. The hardest part is I feel like it\u2019s one sided and I\u2019m the only person trying if I stopped trying the boat would sink. I love doing things for her and making her life easier but at a certain point my mental state is trashed from doing this almost a year. We barely had sex during her whole pregnancy which I understand but she hasn\u2019t even touched me sexually without intercourse , really only thing a man needs to feel loved is that and respect and affirmations. Which she does great on telling me she appreciates me. I get it can be selfish but is it wrong for me wanting to have my needs met too? Or my emotional state cared about? Or feel loved ? I feel like I\u2019m drowning and I\u2019m honestly so in love with her I\u2019d do anything to make it better for her but I\u2019m so lost on what to do I feel like we lost our spark in intimacy , I don\u2019t wanna lose her or my family. I\u2019m young this is my first time doing this I\u2019m still learning I just need advice I wanna marry her soon like propose . But I want some advice I\u2019m drowning.

She was severely bullied last year to the point we moved to go to a different school district in a nearby town. Caught them self-harming a few times when the bullying was as it\u2019s worst. She\u2019s been in therapy for years. Never had many friends at her old school because she was the weirdo art kid in a very preppy school. \n\nMy parents were absurdly religious/strict and I rebelled like a hellion. Found myself in numerous horrific situations I didn\u2019t understand at the time and wouldn\u2019t call them for help because I knew I was already breaking rules. Have really tried to cultivate a relationship with her that was honest and open, while still holding rules and the parent role and thought I was doing a great job until this morning when I discovered so many troubling things. \n\nThey\u2019ve made friends in the new neighborhood and seemed like they were doing really well. One of the neighborhood kids even goes to the to the same magnet art school they auditioned to attend. I was really feeling great and felt like this was the right move and we were making progress. Saw them with joy in their eyes consistently for the first time in forever this summer. And then, school started and they\u2019ve been saying they hate it. Begging to go back to the old district, crying every day after school. I figured it\u2019s just a big change, and they would adjust. \n\nWent through their phone last night and discovered that the new friends are in high school, my child has lied about their age to them, lied to us about their friends ages, and the friend that goes to her same school as an upperclassman, doesn\u2019t even know they go to the same school, because then they would know how old my child truly is. I\u2019ve met and spoken to both of the friends parents, like them, the kids seem nice and I\u2019ve noticed my child seemed happier and the kids seem like good influences. I did notice the kids appeared a little older, but at this age, it\u2019s hard to tell. We have driven or the other parents have driven them places, I track their location and they\u2019ve always been where they were allowed to be. \n\nThey\u2019ve been allowed to have an Instagram that I followed, because they make cosplay costumes and there is a lot with that community on insta. Discovered a \u201chidden\u201d Instagram last night with tons of sexually charged public posts, screenshots of conversations with photos of sex toys being circulated, etc. \n\nObviously, things need to change. They need to come clean with their friends and will likely lose those friendships as a consequence. Instagram is gone and the phone is locked down. \n\nI know it\u2019s my job to protect my kid. Just feeling..I don\u2019t know..guilty? That feels weird to type, but like, I feel like they finally seem to be doing well after struggling for so long and I\u2019m about to burn their whole world to the ground. I know they lied and their actions are causing this but I just have a pit in my stomach. Installing a security system today, because at this point I don\u2019t know what information has been given out and if a predator has our address. I know that protecting them from child predators and whatnot is worth feeling like the bad guy, I know they\u2019re going to hate me at least for awhile, and I\u2019m okay with that if it keeps them safe. \n\nI am struggling navigating this without making them feel like sexuality is bad, or they are bad. They\u2019ve made a ton of poor choices and will suffer those consequences, but I don\u2019t want to scar them for life or encourage this behavior to continue at all. \n\nMy therapist can\u2019t get me in until next week, they haven\u2019t found anyone in our new city they mesh well with and I hadn\u2019t made it a priority as they seemed so much happier since the move. Obviously, that\u2019s a first thing Monday phone call. \n\nHelp. I\u2019m freaking out, and need to address this promptly.",

Well she's been staying with us temporarily while she's between homes. My husband and I have a son who is 3 and his dad told me that he thinks it's dangerous for our son to be around a trans person. I have witnessed her many times and she is better at playing with him than I am for God's sake. She plays so many imaginative games with him and is so gentle with him. Now, the FIL is harping on all these really tiny little changes in our son like \"he's talking about monsters\" and \"he called a boy at the pool \"she\"\" and just all these little seemingly developmentally normal things and he's trying to place the blame on me for allowing him to spend time with my trans friend.\n\nShe *never* talks about gender or sex around him, she doesn't tell him about pronouns, she only plays games with him that are appropriate for his age. She is actually more careful than I am about using curse words around him as sometimes I slip up but she doesn't. I don't know how to handle this. It's causing major stress for me. Anyway I don't know if anyone has advice, but if not, I just needed to rant because this FIL switches between direct accusations and passive aggressive behavior and he wants to place blame on her/me for every tiny change or seemingly negative thing he sees in our son. He says \"something is going on with him\" in an accusatory manner, and I keep reminding him that children go through changes and phases quickly at this age.\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nMany people jumped to the idea of saying that he shouldn't be allowed around my son. But I believe in first trying to work things out with people instead of just cutting contact at the first problem. I made this post mainly to vent.

He's only just an incoming sophomore this year. \n\nHis mother and I are amicably divorced. He's lived with me for much of this summer due to convenience sake relative to where he was working. Between these two factors, I have ended up leading a lot of the parental response. \n\nHe moves back to school in a few short weeks and I want to be sure I've got my bases covered. Although I'm sure this must be a common situation, I'm struggling to find any books or professional columns on the subject that don't have an ideological bent or aren't targeted to parents of younger teens. \n\nWe have a strong rapport and discuss important topics openly but I've never had to go into uncharted territory before. All the conversations have been standard \"old as time\" things about drugs, sex, financial responsibility, etc. that there are clear blueprints for. This situation is completely new to me. \n\nThanks in advance for any insight anyone might be able to provide!",

FTM here of an almost 15 month old sweet baby girl.\nI\u2019m not gonna sugarcoat it because I think I messed up and I don\u2019t know how to fix it without lots of crying from me and my daughter. \nMy daughter is still breastfed and she contact naps/cosleeps and falls asleep on the boob for every nap and bedtime. Through the night while we cosleep she latches randomly so I know she is using the boob to soothe herself back to sleep as well. I know I should have addressed this sooner and gotten her to learn to self soothe or whatever but I get instantly overwhelmed when she cries and it was so much easier to just let her have the boob. \n\nI am getting to the point that I think I want to stop breastfeeding but when I tell you she is reliant on it it\u2019s like her only comfort and I feel like a monster for even thinking about taking it away. I would also love to get her sleeping independently at some point. My husband and I are not in a great place and being sleep divorced definitely has not helped in our relationship or our non existent sex life. \n\nIs there anything I can do to help her and myself make this a smooth transition? I know boob is the only way she knows to fall asleep and I know it\u2019s my fault but I\u2019m feeling desperate. I know I can\u2019t just go cold turkey but are there any suggestions or blogs or anything? I asked in my mommy group and they all FREAKED out I wanted to stop breastfeeding and it made me feel horrible. Please help I\u2019ll take any advice.

This was very much a planned and wanted pregnancy. Well, at least until I actually got pregnant. My husband seems to have had some sort of mild mental break ever since I became pregnant. He drinks a lot more, talks about how his life is ruined now, how he's going to be a terrible dad, etc. He's told me I should leave him and try to find some other man to be the father of my child. He's even talked about killing himself. (Don't worry- he's seeing a professional now).\n\nHe hasn't wanted to be involved in any aspects of this pregnancy and planning for the baby. He doesn't want to look at sonogram photos, doesn't want to feel my belly, and doesn't want to plan the nursery or talk about names. When he has gone to appointments with me, he just sulks. And on top of that, he had gender disappointment when we found out the sex. (He wanted a girl but we're having a boy).\n\nI really thought that this was just temporary cold feet at the beginning, but now I'm in my third trimester and nothing has changed. He says he's not going anywhere and he'll support me however I need, but he knows he's going to be a terrible dad and still sometimes encourages me to leave him. The issue has nothing to do with him knowing nothing about newborn/childcare. He's a pediatrician. He loves kids. And he wanted this kid, but sometimes he insinuates that I pressured him into this which I ABSOLUTELY DID NOT. It's borderline delusional.\n\nI did manage to get him to see a psychiatrist, and he's being medicated for depression/anxiety now. It seems to have stabilized his more intense episodes, but he still seems so unhappy and unenthused about having a baby and it's completely tainted my pregnancy experience. I just want to experience this joy together.\n\nAny advice would be so greatly appreciated. I really need him to be okay by the time the baby comes.",

        "content": "I don't know if this is the right place for this post, but I need to vent (and advice is welcome too). My(35y) husband(38y) and I welcomed our first child 12 weeks ago. I had an easy-ish pregnancy, but a brutal, long labor that ended in an emergency c-section. While I was pregnant, we still had sex twice a week (once a week towards the end) - Most of the time, I wasn't in the mood because my libido plummeted from the start of my pregnancy, but I still made the effort, and because physical intimacy is important to me.\n\nAfter I was cleared at 6 weeks postpartum, we immediately had sex. It was good and I enjoyed it. Since then we've had sex about once every week, sometimes I was in the mood, sometimes I was not. Having a baby is great, but I'm also exhausted a lot, and baby needs attention around the clock (she often cried when we tried to have sex), and I breastfeed so I'm touched out sometimes too. Plus, my libido still hasn't really caught up and I think breastfeeding makes me drier down there (we do use lube). Baby also still sleeps in our room. \n\nThis past week, we were at my husband's family's house for the entire week, sleeping in the guest bedroom right under his parents bedroom, our baby in the bassinet next to us. His siblings were visiting too with their kids, so there was action around the clock. Not much time to ourselves at all and really fun but also quite exhausting with so much family time and little kids around. We didn't have sex at all at his parents house, which I was totally fine with, there wasn't enough time and privacy IMO. The day we flew back home though he told me in a serious way that 'not having sex for a week has been extremely hard' and that he 'just constantly contemplated going to the bathroom and just jerking off'. He kinda made me feel like he's blaming me for it, partly at least. While we were at his parents house he tried to have sex once, while our baby was wide awake next to us on the bed, in the afternoon, when we had 10min to ourselves. I didn't want to because I'm sorry but I can't relax when I know his entire family is right there and might come down any second to ask where we are. Plus they could possibly hear us as well. Plus baby right there with us. \n\nI can't help it but feel hurt by this. If he feels the need to 'help himself' I have absolutely nothing against it. But the fact that he needed to tell me that not having sex for a week (ok, it was 9 days total actually) was 'extremely hard for him' makes me feel very pressured to 'deliver'. I feel like he doesn't even understand how much my body went through - Pregnancy, emergency c-section, breastfeeding, little sleep (He's a great, involved father, but I'm the one who does all night feedings because it's more convenient because of breastfeeding). I feel like having sex once a week at this stage is pretty great and probably more than many others get, and if it happens that we don't have sex for a few more days than a week for reasons like the one above it's fine too. Now I feel like that my reasons don't matter, and that he's gonna be pissed if we don't have sex for a week or longer. \n\nAm I overreacting?",

Way more than I ever wanted my 9 year old to see.\n\nI don\u2019t want to come across as angry at her because I\u2019m not.

I think he hoped I would also just decide 2 is enough for me over time. Pregnancy is easy for me and my body agrees with it, I have bounced back quickly both times in terms of my overall health and physicality. Thank the lord for that. I am just beyond grateful for the ability to bear children. DIVORCE is not a topic we talk about or consider \u2026 my original statement is just that my mind goes there and I think, how can I possibly want or THINK I WANT more children SO BADLY that I\u2019m imagining ending my marriage. \nI will respond to comments too. \n\nThank you all. \n\n\u2014\u2014My husband (40) and I (32) have been together for 8 years. When we met, he did not want kids. He was, let\u2019s say, in his \u201ch*e phase\u201d. I was at the end of mine ready to settle down. I come from a family with 3 children, and have always felt a calling to be a mom when I found the right partner. After we started dating, I knew quickly he was the one. He is very responsible, kind, hardworking, loyal\u2026 I can\u2019t say enough nice things about the person that he is. I won\u2019t sell myself short, either. I am a catch. \nWe had conversations about children prior to being married, and he had made it clear that upon meeting me, he saw a future with children, but before that, it wasn\u2019t something that interested him. He met the right woman to have a family with, is how he puts it. He said he is happy with 2. At the time, I said 2 is fine, but I\u2019ve always pictured myself having more. \nWe have 2 children now, 2 boys, 2.5 years and 6 months. The most recent, I conceived after my husband said he was ready for number 2, I was still in a place where I could have waited, getting back to myself after my first. I was pregnant shortly after that, well immediately! \nAnyway, our 2 boys are wonderful, but as some mamas may know, the yearn for more is wild, especially in the baby stage. I can see myself with at least 1 more pregnancy/baby, if not 2. \nI bring this up very casually, so not to push, and my husband is adamant that he is done having children. It honestly breaks my heart to hear. I\u2019m some weird way, I know that this may break our marriage if I can\u2019t concede to knowing that I too am done at 2. My mind goes to a place of, am I selfish for wanting to break my marriage because I want more children? I love this man, and I love our 2 boys, but I don\u2019t want to regret stopping when I already feel I want more. I was going to give it a year, go back to work and in maybe 2 years bring it up again and at least try for one final baby. I don\u2019t even care about the sex of the baby, I just know I want to parent more children. \nMy husband has told me he will go get fixed, but this cuts me so deep, and it feels like beutrayal, especially if he does it without my consent, as I feel that this then ends our ability as a partnership to have any more children, and basically just ties my hands for me saying \u201cno more\u201d. I know it\u2019s his body, but I would like to understand why more compromise isn\u2019t being made. \nI am off for 1 year maternity with our current son (and of course toddler is with me and my mom helps here and there now that I\u2019m not working), but I will return to work, and I still am \u201cdefault\u201d parent for the boys. I carry majority of those efforts along with my other maternal and wifely duties (meals, groceries, cleaning, activities), I do get help and hire a cleaner once a month while I\u2019m off and then biweekly when I am working just to help with deep cleaning of the house. \nIf anyone is wondering, my mom is full-time caregiver to my boys when I am working. The age gap creates the opportunity for my oldest to be in school and my second to be in part time play school by the time I have a 3rd, so I wouldn\u2019t be adding to her plate and her and I have had these conversations and all she wants for me is more babies. She loves them like her own. The support I have from her is unwavering. \nI know I want more. I feel stuck on how to have this conversation anymore, and I\u2019m afraid to regret not having more children and staying with a man who doesn\u2019t want to\u2026 I love him but I hate to think this could break our marriage because the urge to have more babies is so strong. \nIs my reaction fair?

I don\u2019t want to tell anyone my issues because I feel that they won\u2019t look at me the same or my family. I have a high sex drive and I feel like all my husband wants to do is look at other girls. I know he loves me but at this point I don\u2019t feel like he\u2019s in love with me. I don\u2019t want to get divorced. I love him so much. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m losing all the people I care about. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019m pushing them away.

We took Chrome off her computer recently, because we saw that she had been deleting her browser history. She'll be able to use Edge, but we'll know where she's going.\n\nI have tried to talk to her about it, but she won't tell me what kind of sites she's going to. She says it's not any kind of chat site, that there's no one she's chatting with. She's pretty introverted, so that tracks with what I know about her personality.\n\nThe thing is, I'm pretty open minded. If she wanted to go to porn sites, I would have a talk with her about not getting malware, that it's not a realistic portrayal of what sex is or should be, and the whole body image issue. I wouldn't be angry at her about wanting to see it. I know that's pretty normal at her age. If it's sex ed sites like Scarleteen, I WANT her to go to those.\n\nShe has not expressed any interest in sex. When I told her what porn was, she said that sounded disgusting. Her main interests that I know about are Honkai Star Rail, D&D, the Stars of Chaos book series, and reading in general. As far as I know, she doesn't have any social media accounts. She has said that she wants to be able to go to YouTube without anyone else knowing what videos she's watching. She will not elaborate on what kind of videos.\n\nI'm on the autism spectrum, and I was always looking up weird and geeky stuff in the library and encyclopedia when I was her age. (Now I do it online.) I felt ashamed of being weird and having weird interests, so I didn't want anyone knowing what I was looking up for that reason. I really hope she doesn't feel that way. As far as I know, nobody in the family is shaming her for being interested in anything weird (if my husband is doing that, we will have to have a serious talk).\n\nI'm old enough that there was no internet for general public use when I was her age, so I can't use the way I grew up as a guide here.

        "title": "I may have a teenage son I didn't know about",
        "content": "I want to make this clear I am not wanting relationship advice.  First I do have to give a a little background so you can understand what is going on.\n\nI (40M) have been married 13 years, have kids and I'm overall happy with my life.  A few months ago, my sister was looking at an old friend's Facebook page and noticed an old ex-girlfriend of mine had commented on several of her old friend's posts.  Her profile photo was of her and her 2 kids.\n\nMy sister said one of the kids looked just like me.  For context, the old ex is around 5ft tall and I'm 6'3\".  I was also very slim as a teenager and had a body with very distinctive features.  After she showed me the photo I couldn't stop looking at it.  He did look like a cross between me and her, but tall like me.  I've showed my mom but I don't really want to discuss this with a lot of friends.  He would be around 17 years old now.\n\nI dated this girl for around 1 1/2 years.  I was around 23 and she was 18.  The relationship started off as more physical.  As time went on I realized she was not someone with integrity or that I could trust and I wanted to end it but I still cared about her.  She actually moved in with me for around 8 months because she couldn't get along with her parents.  I used to go on business trips for work every week and I caught her emotionally cheating on me so I broke up with her over the phone while I was gone on a trip and told her to be out when I got back.  She was gone when I got back.  It hurt me but I knew this was the right thing to do.\n\nShe met another guy that same month and married him 3 months from when I broke up with her.  I saw this on Myspace and I thought it odd that she would marry someone so quickly.  She met this other guy immediately after she left too so they would have only known each other for 1-3 months.  Sometime within the next few months she posted something about her being pregnant.  I was slightly worried because we did have a lot of unprotected sex but she said she couldn't get pregnant and was also on birth control.  I remember watching on Myspace sporadically and when the child was born it didn't match up to 40 weeks before when I was with her.  I concluded that he wasn't mine and thankfully let it go. \n\nI had not looked at her myspace or FB in over 16 years until my sister saw this so now I started doing a little research.  The guy she married was in the military so they moved around a lot but they got divorced around 1 year after this kid was born.  That guy is also short like her and he's stocky and looks nothing like this kid imo.  She then married another man in the miliary and had a kid with him.  That kid looks just like that guy so he would have to be his father.  She is now divorced from father no 2 and dating some other guy and has custody of her 2 kids that live with her and this boyfriend.  \n\nI don't want anything to do with her.  \n\nShe isn't someone with integrity and would cause problems in my life but I do want to know if she hid a child from me for 17 years.  \n\nI am a good parent to my 3 kids with my wife and am actively involved in their lives.  I would have been a good dad to that kid if he was mine.  I was by far the more responsible person than her and would have done a great job.  I was never physically abusive to her, I think she just wouldn't have wanted to share the kid with me.   I was also getting ready to move out of state and I think she didn't want to go with me anyway.\n\nSo a few months ago I created a fake email and emailed the first guy who is supposedly the father and lives in another state now.  On his FB there are no photos of him and this child.  He is remarried and has kids and seems like a stable and nice guy really.  I asked him about this kid in a really nice respectful way and simply wanted to know if he is his father.  I told him I was with this girl shortly before him and that this kid look a lot like me.  I wanted to know his birth month since they would have been married when the kid was born.   \n\nHe never replied to me but within around 5 days the ex-girlfriend changed her FB profile photo to one of her holding and shooting a pistol with both hand straight out like she is shooting someone.  This photo is quite out of of character for her.  She also deleted or removed every photo of this kid but not her other photos.  I didn't send any more messages to anyone.  A month later her entire FB account is now gone.  She didn't block me because I can't find her though another account.\n\nIf I'm wrong why would someone behave in this fashion?  Hypothetically, it seems that if I am incorrect this would not be her response.  It's like she was telling me not to open this can of worms now or she would take me out, lol.  Her sister did the same type of thing having children with different men and leaving them all keeping the kids for herself.  I'm not a bad guy though! \n\nWould someone really post something to social media 3-4 months later to make it appear it just occurred when in reality it happened earlier?  That never crossed my mind at the time and seems crazy to think someone would do that to hide a kid.\n\nI'm not sure what to do as the kid will be 18 next year.  I'm not looking for legal advice.  I know what I would have to do if wanted to do something while he is a minor. \n\nFrom what I could tell on FB and what she posted he is just like I was when I was his age and has the same interests which are not really mainstream things.  I feel so bad for the kid if he is mine.  I can't imagine what he would have been told about who is father is.  I showed a photo of the kid to 2 of my children but didn't tell them who it was.  They're young and I asked them if they knew this person.  They both laughed and said that's you daddy.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Oh man ... complicated. Strong indications that he's yours for sure. \n\nYou might not be able to do anything until the kid is 18 though. You could be opening yourself up to legal complications like child support (but that may be OK from your perspective). This will be damaging to your current relationship (wife and kids), just from the chaos this is going to stir up. \n\nAre you imagining this kid is going to come spend weekends with you now, and you're going to \"save\" him from his mother? Maybe you can/will? IDK. I'd recommend thinking long and hard about this before you go contacting him or his mother. \n\nI get that I wouldn't have wanted to have a child out there I didnt know about, but not everything can be fixed.",

        "content": "This is long but please bear with me. \n\nSo my son is 11 and his \u2018best\u2019 friend has been crossing the line lately at my house. Mostly feeling entitled in my home, throwing tantrums in my home, and generally being nasty to my son. I generally love the kid and treat him like family but I can\u2019t help but notice some red flags. However 1) I know kids will be kids and he has a lot of growing up to do and 2) I want my son to learn how to navigate the muddy waters that can be friendship on his own, so I try to not interfere or give him too much of my opinions that may sway too much how he would handle the situation independently.\n\nHowever today the kid crossed the line (and this was after I implented a hiatus from him coming over because I just needed a break from the kid). So I\u2019m 4 months pregnant with a boy and this is the second time I\u2019ve heard him say \u201cI hope you have a girl because if you don\u2019t then I think your son will be gay\u201d.. the first time he said it I didn\u2019t know the sex of my baby, now that I know I\u2019m having a boy he made the comment today that he thinks my son is going to be gay because I\u2019m so girly that I would turn him gay??? Which is weird because my newest son has a dad that\u2019s around (my husband), so I\u2019m not sure where that\u2019s coming from?\n\nMy son immediately spoke up and said \u201cBro, that\u2019s weird. Why would you even say that? Why make a comment like that it makes no sense.\u201d \nWhich I was very proud of my son for speaking up because in general it IS just a weird and ignorant thing to say. Let me add we are LGBTQ+ allies in my home. I\u2019ve taught my son about acceptance, we are God parents to a little girl with two moms, my best friends are gay, and we are accepting of all lifestyles. So it\u2019s not the fact that he thinks my son will be gay but just labeling and judging something he knows nothing about was so rude to me. \n\nI guess the kid got offended that my son called him out because then he said, \u201cAndrew you told me last year you were bi\u201d.. \n\nI need to preface the rest of the story by saying I never had an inkling that my son could be bisexual, nor has he came out to me and I am very open and inviting to all conversations with my son. This isn\u2019t the first time his friend has said this out loud. Whenever he has blurted this out, he follows up by saying that my son took back what he said about being bisexual. so IDK if my son thought he was bisexual for a while, or if he was joking when he told his \u2018best friend\u2019 that he was bisexual , or if the kid spun the story and put words in my sons mouth\u2026 either way idc, I love my son no matter what.\n\nOkay back to the story. Let me add that another neighborhood kid was over and let\u2019s just say this kid is def the type to turn his nose down if he found out if a peer of his was gay. The (other neighborhood) kid then goes on to say how \u2018gross\u2019 being gay is and he would \u2018never\u2019.. Like I mentioned before, this isn\u2019t the first time his \u2018best friend\u2019 has blurted out that my son told him in confidence that he thinks he was bi. He calls it out pretty often and he even told my nephew (which that side of my family is definitely homophobic) who he met through my son.. Now  my nephew even feels the need to call my son out on this, all because the friend opened his mouth about it. Every time the kid has done this I can\u2019t imagine how my son must feel.. heart racing, embarrassed, anxious\u2026 it breaks my heart but I always would say \u201cIDC if my son is gay, I love him no matter what\u201d. \n\nSo the conversation then turned into another bickering argument (as it normally does with them), and pretty soon after the kids had to go home. They left my house and the air was thick with tension, awkwardness, and just in general bad vibes. I asked my son if he was okay and he was just trying to keep a brave face.. it broke my heart. Just typing out this story infuriates me all over. \n\nSo I decided that my husband and I need to speak with his father. Did I think the comment about my unborn child being gay was rude and unnecessary, sure.. but what I\u2019m really upset and disturbed and fed up with is the fact that IF INDEED my son is bisexual, then this kid keeps outing my son. If my son isn\u2019t, then the kid is spreading lies and rumors to people. (By the way my son and I were talking in the kitchen after everything went downand he mentioned that his \u2018best friend\u2019 misunderstood a conversation they had at one point and now the kid things that my son is bisexual). Whether my son is telling the truth or lying because he doesn\u2019t want to come out to me yet.. again.. idc. I love him no matter what.. Anywho.. either way the situation is dangerous. As much as we would like to think the world has fully progressed, it hasn\u2019t. Especially in the pre teen boy community. They are about to enter middle school together and if keeps going around telling people this it could put a target in my sons back. Just in general I hate seeing my son get treated like crap by someone he considers a best friend. \n\nWe plan on asking the dad to talk to his son about not going around saying those things about my son anymore. I\u2019m pretty sure dad will agree as his their family is also progressive. Probably more progressive than we are \ud83d\ude02\n\nDoes anyone have advice on the situation? I kind of don\u2019t want him in my home anymore.. Advice on what to say to the dad.. Any feedback at all. \n\nThank you for reading if you made it to the end\ud83e\ude75\ud83e\ude75",

I could really use some insight from other parents.\n\nMy husband (36m) and I (33f) have been married for almost 3 years, together for close to 10. Our daughter was born a few months ago and is our first child. My husband is overall a good dad, he works normal hours and I stay at home since we decided I would take the first year off work to be with our daughter. Therefore 95% of the childcare and housework falls on me, including the baby\u2019s overnight care. While I\u2019m happy (and grateful) to do it, I\u2019m often worn out by the end of the day.\n\nNow getting to the issue. My husband has a very high sex drive, me not as much especially after having our daughter. However, I know how important intimacy is to him so I try to make time. We usually have sex twice a week which my husband says does not meet his needs, but it\u2019s all I can manage right now. I am also not comfortable having sex if my daughter is awake or in the same room, even if she\u2019s sleeping in the bassinet in our bedroom. If we\u2019re in the middle of sex and she wakes up in her room/crib calmly, I\u2019ll let her chill so we can finish up. However if she\u2019s crying, I\u2019m completely unable to focus on anything else and I stop sex, which pisses my husband off.\n\nThe other day I went and told him \u201chey the baby\u2019s asleep, let\u2019s go!\u201d But by the time I had quickly used the bathroom, she was wide awake and crying. I always give her a couple minutes to see if she\u2019ll go back to sleep on her own, but that was not the case here. When I told my husband \u201csorry, we\u2019ll have to try again later\u201d he was so mad and told me to never do that again, and that backing out was stupid. Am I being too prudish or something?

It really got me thinking, how are people educating their kids about sex and puberty? Is this a conversation folks are owning at home? If so, when do you start? I know when I was a kid this was one \"talk\" and then the rest came from school offerings. I want to do more of a layering approach and answer my kid's questions as they have them or have exposure that way it's sort of always part of our discourse and they feel comfortable coming to me. But I didn't think the school curriculum would impede any of my values. I am so curious to learn more about how folks are handling this important topic.",

My son is autistic and he struggles with really bad abnormal impulses (porn addiction and more), so a little back story from a couple months ago, he broke into our room and stole sex toys from us and brought them to school and was harassing girls at his school with them and got suspended and since then we got a safe to lock everything up and our room as well. And just before that his first girlfriend broke up with him because she would constantly so no to his forcible sexual advances. \nHe has stole a laptop from school just to stay up every night to watch porn and this went on for a month before we found the laptop and since then he isn\u2019t allowed on any technology at school because they caught him watching porn constantly there also, and we don\u2019t allow him to have a cellphone. He constantly lies about everything and shows no emotion or empathy towards us. Trying to get him to help around the house on his own is next to impossible.\nWe do have his doctor and social workers trying their best and therapy to help but it\u2019s not enough. We thought that we solved the problem but..\nSo fast forward to this evening I decided to look through his room because it was a mess, then I found girls underwear and tops under his bed that he said he got from school, plus I found my male sex toy under his bed, his own father\u2019s toy and was using it!  He broke into our room and safe with our own keys when we didn\u2019t notice.\nI\u2019m absolutely mortified and embarrassed for him, me and his mom, she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable around him because of the stuff he has been doing and I don\u2019t blame her.\n I have full custody of him and his biological mother isn\u2019t in the picture but his stepmother and I have been together for over ten years, we are both hard working parents and we are trying to be there for him but it\u2019s been so hard. \nWe are so upset right now and don\u2019t know what to do either. We both feel like we have failed as parents.\nMy question is there anything I can do like maybe put him in the psych ward or anything to help him?? \nI can\u2019t fight the thought that he will end up like some sexual predator or even worse since he has no emotion about his actions.\nWe are both out of ideas and don\u2019t know what to do anymore, we love him and want the best for him but it has been so hard to deal with. Any advice would be much appreciated thx.",

And she is my sweet sensitive one! \n\nContext: My baby daddy lives a few towns over. He hasn\u2019t seen the kids since early 2016. He was removed from the home for authoring first-person narrative pedo-erotica. He was required to do Sex Offender Management Board therapy before having any contact and clearly he never did. A few months ago my oldest asked for the details of why he left. Previously all she knew was that \u2018daddy wrote bad letters about hurting children so until he does special therapy he\u2019s not safe to be around\u2019. I provided the documents to her therapist and she learned the highest level version of what the stories entailed. She, rightly assumed, that at this point he was just waiting until she turned 18 to avoid going to therapy. She said she wanted to know so that when he came sniffing, she would have already decided how she felt about the facts so she could respond thoughtfully. So I obliged. But now after months of digestion, this is what she says to me about it?! I\u2019m dead.\nAs for her dad, she wrote him a letter simply saying, \u2018 I know what you did. You didn\u2019t to the therapy and wasted my whole childhood because of your ego. If you\u2019re waiting until I\u2019m 18 to avoid having to be accountable, don\u2019t waste my time. Do the work you need to do and until then I have nothing to say to you. Leave my sister alone too. Be kind to my mom because she\u2019s the only reason we\u2019re okay.\u2019\n\nI\u2019m so proud. I think I\u2019ve finally hit the point where they are starting to see and make assessments for themselves that he\u2019s a whole dirtbag. I\u2019ve never talked bad about him.

I\u2019m not sure if that medication made the plan B not to work but I just found out today I\u2019m pregnant again.

Daycare is so expensive and we can\u2019t really afford for me to stop working so I can stay home with two kids under two. I also feel like it would not be fair for our 3 kids.

How did you over come this? If you had an abortion do you regretted? If you didn\u2019t and had the baby do you wish you didn\u2019t? I really need advise.. \n\nUPDATE\n\nI just want to clarify some things because I think a lot of you are assuming the worse of my husband. To begin with he did not forced me nor did I feel pressured to have unprotected sex. It was a mutual (dumb) decision and I know. This one was the one and only time we had sex without condom. I do not use the Plan B as a regular form of contraception. This was the one and only time I used it and well it did not work. The reason why I did not get back on birth control is because I have tried all form of BC and they all give me side effects. My husband was the one who mentioned to me he did not want any more kids. I told him he should get a vasectomy done. I did not pressure him because his body his choice (yes I believe it goes both ways). I was open to possibly one more kid down the road when our baby was older and we were better off financially. It was never on my plans to get pregnant this soon. \n\nMy husband and I sat down and had a conversation of the pros and cons of terminating the pregnancy or keep it. Ultimately he supports whatever decision I make and he will be getting the vasectomy done so we don\u2019t find ourselves in this situation again. I will be making an appointment with my OB to discuss possible termination and consequences of going forward with that. My main concern is my mental health if I decide to proceed with the termination. I will also be making an appointment with a therapist before  I make any decision. \n\nThank you everyone for your comments and input. \nI hope this clarifies a lot of the questions and comments about my husband and yes I understand we both are to blame as we were not careful enough.",

I know talking to your parent about sex stuff is uncomfortable which is why I don't think she came to us about this. I just don't know how to handle this situation. Any advice would be appreciated",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "My child isn\u2019t a teenager yet but I was once a teenager who told her secrets to a trusted family member (who promptly told my parents - as they should). \n\nYour daughter told your mom because she wants help (or because what happened was too heavy for her to keep to herself). She may not be comfortable telling you and your husband directly but that doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t want you guys to know.\n\nGiven the way you described the situation, I think it makes sense for your mom to give your daughter  a heads up that she told you because she loves her and she wants her to get the help and protection she needs and to let her know you are going to ask about it. \n\nIn the meantime, regardless of what you end up learning, I would avoid all contact with the son, indefinitely.\n\nIf your daughter won\u2019t speak to you, I\u2019d offer to schedule an appointment with a therapist. I would focus on the fact that you\u2019re not trying to be nosy and all you want is for her to be safe, happy, and comfortable. It\u2019s obvious that she needs to speak to someone. Show that you\u2019re willing to explore solutions with her to facilitate that happening and that it\u2019s not about you.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened to your daughter and good luck!",

The problem is that she\u2019s pretty smart and knows that we haven\u2019t given her the whole story. Her mom wants me to explain how babies get there, which is what my daughter is really curious. I feel super lame for this but my response so far has been that the mom should do it since it seems weird for a dad to explain to his daughter what sex is. I\u2019ve gotta do something about this, because the more it\u2019s made to be forbidden and taboo and stuff, the more my daughter is gonna be interested in it. My SO (her mom) is starting to worry that something happened to our daughter and that\u2019s why she\u2019s so curious about all this stuff, but I think that\u2019s just because some bad stuff happened to her as a kid and she\u2019s always been super worried about something happening to our daughter as a result. Some help from anyone with a similar experience, whether it was them growing up with this curiosity or maybe you dealt with this with your child, would be really appreciated.\n\nEdit to say that it\u2019s not weird to do, but just feels weird to me I guess.

        "content": "I am 4 months postpartum. We have the happiest, chillest, easiest baby ever (still a baby though).\n\nPartner (24M) and I (27F) have had some issues in our relationship for while. For me, mostly that I feel he doesn\u2019t listen to me especially when I talk about feelings/behaviors/corrections. He doesn\u2019t do personal reflection, at least in any way I can see or understand. He feels like I am a nag, and that I always try to/like to start fights for \u2018nothing\u2019. That life is better off just letting things go and not letting anything bother you.\n\nThese issues have blown up postpartum, as well as others.\n\nI\u2019ve repeatedly told him how overwhelmed and exhausted I feel. I handle all nights with baby and care for her all day while I work (she comes with me to work). I breastfeed (only, no bottles). I handle 100% of grocery shopping, cooking, kitchen responsibilities, and laundry. Up until recently I was mostly responsible for all other household cleaning as well. I do not have support where we live (family is 3000 miles away) apart from a single friend. I have been struggling with PPD/PPA for a few months now. I have thoughts of suicide almost daily (I rarely feel suicidal, the thoughts are more along the lines of everything would be better/easier if I wasn\u2019t here, just the overwhelming caving in on me). The PPD seems highly responsive to our relationship. He should be my primary support and when we fight (now daily) I feel so alone. I have told him all of this multiple times.\n\nHe also works full time, and is in pilot school which is typically 10ish hours per week. His home responsibilities include taking out trash, cleaning floors, cleaning bathrooms, and car care.\n\nIn his eyes, I am not doing enough. He says I have time to accomplish more. That I some days come late to work or leave early, and so during those times I should put the baby in her chair and do more household tasks. That baby and I should be more advanced with independent napping so I can get stuff done while she sleeps, that I should be trying more to spend time with him. When I try to reason with him I get nowhere. \n\nHe won\u2019t recognize the weight of night time care, as it doesn\u2019t make sense for him to help. He won\u2019t recognize the weight of daily care, as he thinks she should go to daycare. He won\u2019t recognize the weight of working full time as it\u2019s \u2018normal\u2019. He won\u2019t recognize the weight of the PPD as he can\u2019t understand it, and seemingly has no desire to learn. On top of all this caring for the house & managing our extremely rocky relationship is exhausting. We work & live together, so there\u2019s no escape from the fighting.\n\nI try to reason with him that 4 months is such little time. That he\u2019s pressuring me to be more when I am breaking my back & overwhelmed with what I have now, and that this is my best. When I say I don\u2019t want baby going to daycare yet because she is too little and I don\u2019t feel ready and that it\u2019s not necessary for her to go, he says it\u2019s \u2018completely normal\u2019 for her to go and that I\u2019m \u2018creating a weak baby\u2019.\n\nI feel myself losing feeling, respect, and patience for him. I am trying my absolute best to keep my head & my heart in this. Ideally I\u2019d like to try for at least another 6 months or so because I\u2019ve read that relationship problems are normal while baby is young, but I feel he has no patience. He won\u2019t take responsibility for his part in this and thinks that it\u2019s mostly my fault our relationship is going down the tube. \n\nI just want to add that I am absolutely willing to accept responsibility for what I\u2019ve added to our situation. I have been reactive, sometimes grumpy or even mean. I apologize for it, and attribute it to PPD and overwhelm but I don\u2019t really feel that\u2019s an excuse. I know I need to get into therapy and get help but I feel as if I never have time to call around and try to get care, or to do things like meditate or exercise to try to help myself. I have also cut off most physical things between us, as I have some sexual trauma that makes it difficult for me to connect physically while our relationship feels so rocky/we\u2019re disconnected from each other. Physical affection is a big love language for him, and I\u2019m trying my best to give him what I can while also respecting myself when I want to say no to not reinforce the trauma I\u2019m navigating. It\u2019s frustrating for him, I know, and I\u2019ve told him that this isn\u2019t my choice and I feel badly that I\u2019m not meeting him where he\u2019d like. If it adds any context, we have had sex since the baby probably ten or so times but not in the last few weeks.\n\nI need to know how resilient I should be here. It\u2019s my nightmare for us to separate and share baby. I feel like a failure as a parent when I consider it. But what we\u2019re in now isn\u2019t sustainable. We can\u2019t get through a day without conflict and baby will start to see that eventually, or maybe already is. I can\u2019t get through a day without getting upset at him and vice versa.

During this time he becomes obsessed with wiping to ensure that every last bit is completely clean, and even once done (I usually end up helping him with a bit of wet tissue), he will complain that he feels like there's more poo to come/his bottom is too dry/too wet. Just generally seems to be overthinking the entire thing. This is causing issues in the morning as he'll often be late to leave for school.\n\nAre there any age-appropriate books I can give him to help him realise that he doesn't need to do these things and not to worry so much? Anything I say falls on dear ears when he's obsessing over it.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that this started to happen in conjunction with learning about sex education at school, and the start of the transition to secondary school, so I suspect anxiety is a big factor.

When she got pregnant the first time, so many people told us how we messed up because we were giving up all of our freedom, etc. When we had the second, everyone said we were making a mistake because of the financial burden of having two children and it would be too much to take care of both of them. In public, people look at us with these pity looks all the time like our lives must be absolutely miserable. Old women make comments about how we got started young. Our friends act like we live the worst life imaginable. We WANTED these children. We LOVE these children. I wouldn\u2019t trade these kids for anything in the world and I love every single moment of being their father. Just because we are young, it doesn\u2019t mean we didn\u2019t intentionally choose this life. They weren\u2019t an accident and I\u2019m tired of people acting like they are. On top of that, when my wife got her tubes tied, everyone said we would regret that because we would want more in the future. No. We wanted 2, we got 2, we are sticking with 2. How are you going to act like having kids is a mistake, and then act like preventing kids is a mistake? Sorry we like having sex without a piece of rubber between us.

At her age, I believe my wife and I\u2019s goals are to\u2026 \n\n- ensure my daughter knows her body as something to be proud of and begin exploring (we got her a mirror to put in the ground) but also as private in certain contexts.\n- make sure she understand the literal difference between the sexes \u201cdada and brother have that. Mama and I have this!\u201d\n- begin teaching her hygiene as we start potty training\n- provide tools for her to communicate about the body (perhaps she\u2019s feeling pain) with adults\n\nWith all that in mind..

        "most_upvoted_comment": "Teaching your child the correct terminology for their body parts is crucial for several reasons:\n\n1. **Safety and Protection**: Knowing the proper names for their body parts helps children communicate more clearly if they need to report inappropriate behavior or abuse. It can make it easier for adults to understand and take necessary action.\n\n2. **Body Autonomy and Respect**: Using correct terminology fosters a sense of body ownership and autonomy. It teaches children that all parts of their body are important and deserve respect, promoting a healthy self-image.\n\n3. **Medical Accuracy**: In medical situations, being able to use accurate terms helps healthcare providers understand and address any issues more effectively. It ensures that children can describe symptoms and concerns accurately.\n\n4. **Reduces Shame and Stigma**: Using euphemisms or \"cutesy\" names can imply that certain body parts are shameful or embarrassing. Correct terminology normalizes all parts of the body, reducing stigma and fostering open communication.\n\n5. **Clear Communication**: Accurate terminology helps children express themselves clearly and understand others better. It reduces confusion and misunderstandings in conversations about health and safety.\n\n6. **Education and Development**: Learning correct terms is part of a child's overall education and development. It helps them build a comprehensive understanding of their body, which is crucial for their growth and development.\n\n7. **Empowerment**: Knowledge is empowering. When children know the correct terms, they feel more confident and capable of discussing their body and health, leading to better self-advocacy as they grow older.\n\nOverall, teaching children the correct terminology for their body parts is an essential part of their education, promoting safety, respect, clear communication, and a positive self-image.",

When you go on a family vacation with your kids or if it\u2019s your family and another family both vacationing together, do you expect to have sex with your spouse/partner?\n\nMy husband tries to plan time for us to be alone on every trip or weekend outing.  He will either request a suite so we have a separate bedroom from our kids or ask a family member to watch them for an hour or so (both without asking me about it).  We\u2019ve argued numerous times about this.  I think it\u2019s inappropriate to expect to have sex on a family trip.  If it were just the 2 of us, then yes, I could see the expectation, but I don\u2019t get the need for it when family is the focus.  Additionally, he seems to think because we\u2019re spending a lot of money on whatever we\u2019re doing that sex should be a given. He sees it as an enhancer to the experience, just like fine dining or high end shopping would be when you\u2019re on vacation. It\u2019s not making sense to me.

I don\u2019t know why and I don\u2019t know how to fix it.\n\nI have 4 kids. Two of them are 14 year old twin girls. None of my other kids act this way, not even her twin sister who was raised the exact same way in the exact same environment. I\u2019ve tried so hard to crack this and nothing helps.\n\nShe\u2019s 14 years old and has already been pregnant once (had a miscarriage). She told me she wants to have a baby and I \u201ccan\u2019t stop her.\u201d \n\nShe regularly dates boys who are way too old for her. The current boy is 18 years old. It\u2019s not something I allow or condone. He\u2019s not allowed at our house. She is not allowed to go anywhere with him, but predictably the more I try to keep him away the more effort she puts into finding ways to see him. \n\nI personally drop her off from school and pick her up from school. She cut class so many days this past school year that I was contacted by the school saying per their policies they could technically hold her back a year because she missed more than the maximum allowed classes. Now, I had no idea this was happening since she was always there when I picked her up at the end of the school day. Luckily, she gets good grades. She\u2019s a very smart girl. This is the only reason the school agreed to not hold her back or kick her out.\n\nShe has been caught drunk at her friend\u2019s house. I don\u2019t even keep alcohol in my house.\n\nShe and a friend have also met up with and gotten into the car and gone off with much older boys who they had never met in real life before and who I certainly never met.\n\nShe\u2019s has become extremely disrespectful to me and her siblings. No physical violence.\n\nShe has stollen money from me.\n\nI caught her sharing topless photos of herself with strangers online.\n\nI have discussed this all with her doctor. We\u2019ve been referred to mental health care professionals and counselors. She absolutely will not open up to a therapist. She speaks to them disrespectfully and says she doesn\u2019t need any help. \n\nWhen it comes to sex, I have never preached abstinence or waiting until marriage. I believe in educating my children about sex and ensuring they have access to all types of protection. However, I very firmly believe that 14 is way too young to have sex regardless of how safe it is. Still, I feel that the best I can do not is ensure she\u2019s protected. I can\u2019t watch her 24/7. She skips classes in the middle of the day and stays in school grounds and somehow manages to hook up with boys where there should be adults ensuring this doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nRules and boundaries mean nothing to her. Absolutely nothing. They are like fun challenges to her. How can she pulverize them the quickest? And I\u2019ve tried to come at it from an understanding place. \n\nHer siblings can\u2019t stand her. She and her twin sister used to be as close as can be, but even her twin sister wants nothing to do with her at this point. \n\nShort of shipping her off to a boarding school, which I can\u2019t afford and I don\u2019t necessarily feel comfortable with for a variety of reasons, I\u2019m at the end of my rope over what else I can do.",

We have six animals also, three dogs and three cats, and my wife works from 6am (well starts at 8-9am but doesn\u2019t do much kid duty in the morning) until about 6pm.

She\u2019s a baby who is very much wanting to be held a lot, attached to my legs if I say mama can\u2019t hold you right now, and basically just needs a lot. I don\u2019t have an issue with that as I get it - she\u2019s a baby. But the thing is I am EXHAUSTED by 6pm. I spend about an hour putting her to bed lately and it\u2019s been around 730pm. I pretty much do everything for our daughter and lately my wife has been missing dinner as dinner is around 5pm. A lot of times I don\u2019t even eat myself but make something for our daughter. I know I\u2019m probably not meeting my wife\u2019s emotional needs and she tells me she needs more of me holding her, tonight she said she would like it if I smiled at her more, and I just am too tired honestly to give her much. I\u2019m in therapy and that\u2019s how we came to the conclusion to start daycare so I\u2019m hoping once we get into that I can have some more to give to my wife.

I am not any less in love or whatnot and I tell her this. I\u2019m just running on fumes. I can\u2019t bring myself to cuddle and I do feel bad about it. Is there a way to turn off parent mode and just chill out? She seems a lot better at it than me but maybe it\u2019s because she\u2019s not primary parent?

I got really solid advice and it ended up being a non-issue, I just bluntly talked to them about it and they were like \u201cGirl, you\u2019re grown, we know you have sex, it\u2019d be weird if y\u2019all didn\u2019t. Just let us know when we need to leave\u201d. Now, I\u2019m asking for completely different advice. My husband has a gun that is currently locked in a safe under our bed. I didn\u2019t wanna keep it from the girls that we have one in the house, so I told them we have one, it\u2019s in a safe, and it\u2019s to never be touched by them under any circumstances.

Should we take them to the range to get classes so they know how to safely use a weapon? They want to enlist in the military like we did, so I feel like them knowing how to use one would be helpful and it\u2019d make me more comfortable knowing they know how to use one safely, but I also know they\u2019re scared of guns because of the environment we grew up in.

When they're awake, we try to avoid tv as a family, but if we do put something on its something geared to their ages such as Bluey or Tumbleleaf. We do not ever put on our shows when they're awake. \n\nI've talked to my friends with similar aged kids and they just watch their own shows while their kids are up and if it bothers the kids they can leave the room. \n\nThis recently became a little issue when I came home after my dad was babysitting and found him watching a Planet of The Apes movie in the living room while my kids played barbies in the same room. He didn't see the issue at all and said \"I did when you were kids and y'all are fine!\". I just don't think they need to be exposed to violence, sex, and other adult themes. I'm not judging what other parents do for their kids, that's just my comfort level for my own kids and I stand very firm on this. \n\nIt's very clear most people in our lives find this to be a little strict and unreasonable.

He claims his job is more important than mine and he needs more rest. He did not to any nighttime feeds because I was breastfeeding or the fact that our daughter is not comforted by him and just screams for me. This has gotten slightly better over the last few months. \n\nI am the only one who cooks dinner/meals. We split all the other chores but things like dishes and laundry do fall more heavily on me. \n\nHe also wakes me up at 2 or 3am to have sex, because that's when HE is in the mood..he gets upset and says it's my fault he has to watch porn if I say no. Which is killing out sex life. Our 2.5 year old often gets up around 4, 5 or 6 most days. I have to nudge him away and beg him to put her back to sleep because she won't go back to bed for me at 4 or 5. He always takes far too long to get up and out of bed..he also gets FULLY dressed which takes far too long when he's just going to go back to bed anyways. Then he makes offhand comments about how his day is ruined and how he can't do what he wanted to do because he will be too tired. \n\nIf I mention that I rarely get any sleep, and that inwas getting barely 2 hours of sleep at a time and I STILL had to drive to appointments, cook, clean, and entertain the baby; he gets upset and tells me it's not a competition. \n\nToday, I worked 11-7 and he's off..he usually takes mornings on Fridays. Our daughter woke at 5am and I asked him to put her back to bed. (I went to bed at 11, he woke me for sex at 2am I think) He begrudgingly did, but she was up again at 6. I nabbed her at 6, with the intention of taking her to daycare for 9, then going back home and napping until 10:45 before work. We ended up half napping until 8. She does this thing where she still tries to breast feed and pinches my nips and it's horribly painful. Breakfast took way too long and dressing her is like trying to put clothes on a feral racoon. I also love her and felt guilty so we didn't go to daycare until 10. I did end up napping for 45 minutes. \n\nCoffee isn't even touching this fatigue. I'm too exhausted to walk to dogs, to really play at the park, to do anything extra. I'm snappy, depressed and just all around upset. Husband is angry at me for losing my temper with our daughter when she refuses to be set down, when she on purpose yeets her food or drink because she thinks it's funny, or when she throws tantrums because she wants treats. \n\nI told him, if he wants to judge me, he can get his ass out of bed before 9am and come help me. To which he replied \"yeah ok\" sarcastically. He works 10-6 mon to wed, 11-7 Thursdays and 1-9 Sundays. \nI work rotating days, evenings and weekends. This leaves me with absolutely no rest.

        "content": "My daughter (7) attended a party today at a park.  It is bordered by a busy road, a parking lot, a creek, woods and some big fields.  There\u2019s a playground with really fun equipment and a pavilion with the treats.  Sometimes there are 10-30 random adults strolling around and another 10-30 kids.  So at theses parties, nobody really watches the kids. Some drop off and leave others stay and chat with each other.  I go to watch my kid.  But from any single vantage point, I can only see 25% of the area. The kids run everywhere.  So I walk around trying to keep tabs on kiddo from a distance. So it\u2019s several hours in the sun, scanning, following and scanning.  This is in the city outskirts of St Louis.  There was a known sex offender chatting up kids at a park party about a mile away a few months back.  Parents were pretty upset by that.  (We we\u2019re not there) So the woods: there are plenty of mangled rusty metal things and broken bottles  and garbage.  A couple of kids  went off into the woods, including mine.  I had to go all the way  over there, climb down a muddy bank in my flats to tell her to come up.  The kids were all mad .  Then some said that x\u2019s mom (the party hostess) said it\u2019s ok for us to be down here.  Meaning, I can extricate my kid (with difficulty) but everyone else gets to play and have fun.  So I\u2019m stuck.  Fine so I give in and stand in the woods getting devoured by mosquitos so she can play.  After a while, I told mine it was time to go.  Walking back, a dad showed up and was like \u201chuh, I had no idea my kid was down there.  We come here all the time for baseball practice and just let her disappear down there or wherever for 2-3 hours but she always comes back. So far anyway, ha ha.\u201d  \nSo I\u2019m the meanest mom and surely embarrass my kid in front of her friends.  I can live with that.  One of my childhood friends (10) was kidnapped and murdered.  She was riding her bike 2 blocks from home in a fancy suburb.  So I probably am more anxious about this than other parents.  But I remember the months of waiting, the searches, the cadaver dogs and the grisly discovery very clearly. And I remember what it did to that family. So it\u2019s not like it doesn\u2019t happen.  I\u2019m determined not to let that happen but I recognize that that\u2019s my own thing and I don\u2019t want to make my kid fearful of the world. I feel stuck. I despise these parties. I don\u2019t like being the meanest mom, keeping her from skipping stones and whatever.   I get it.  I\u2019m Gen X and did whatever I wanted.  Can anyone tell me it\u2019s ok to be protective? Or am I really alone on this? \nEdit: the kids did not stick together in the woods, it was 4 kids, but they wandered off by themselves too. Also, an adult party with loud music was nearby so they kids were not visible and could not be heard from the party area or by any other adult",

I\u2019m very excited to have them here and I feel kind of selfish for even worrying about this, but how do you have sex with teens in the house? Should I just send them off to the movies or the mall with some spending money so we can get some \u201calone time\u201d? They\u2019re my sisters, so they know I have sex, but I\u2019m honestly deathly afraid of them hearing us/walking in on us! My husband and I had a bit of a rough patch for about a year where my sex drive was nonexistent due to medications I was on and a miscarriage that broke me emotionally, so it\u2019s very important to me that we keep our sex life fun and healthy because I now know how much no sex can affect a marriage. We don\u2019t have any kids of our own and haven\u2019t ever had roommates since being together, so we\u2019ve never really dealt with having to hide us having sex. Any advice for a DINKWAD couple going straight into having two teenagers?\n\nEditing to add I\u2019m 23F and my husband is 24M, so we\u2019re not that far apart in age! Just realized I forgot to put that in there\n\nEditing again to add they won\u2019t be in high school due to our mom encouraging truancy (to the point of making them beg friends for rides to school) and drop out so they can work. They won\u2019t be getting jobs so they can put their full focus on getting their GEDs (grades are so bad they\u2019d have to start high school from the beginning and doing that isn\u2019t an option as the high schools here) and getting them ready to enlist in the military (they want to join the Air Force like I did). I am thinking about finding some volunteer opportunities and/or local clubs for them to join until the GED classes start later this year though!\n\nEdit: We moved the girls up here yesterday! I just talked with them separately, just me and them without my husband or mom there, and was like \u201cHey, yall know I\u2019m married and do married people stuff, is it cool if I give y\u2019all some spending money and drop you off at the mall or the movie theatre so we can have alone time?\u201d and they said (verbatim) \u201cGirl you\u2019re GROWN grown, we know you have sex, we can just go to the pool or mall or whatever\u201d so it was a non-issue that I was nervous about for no reason lol! Thank you all for all of the tips, and to the people that DMd me weird things, you\u2019re gross. No, I\u2019m not worried about my husband and sisters being in the same house, if I was I wouldn\u2019t have married him, they are my life and I cut off any person who speaks in a disrespectful or gross manner about them. And no, just because I posted about my husband and I having sex, it DOES NOT mean I want dick pics or other sexual messages from you randos! Otherwise, it\u2019s going great! They even cooked dinner for us all tonight! I\u2019m so glad to have my babies safe and sound under my roof!

She was there when mom got sick. Since mom has passed, grandma has played a big role in my daughters life. \n\nNow my daughter refuses to talk to her grandma. Her reason: she won't let me be who I really am. Here are some of the reasons she mentioned:\n\n\\* She can't talk about boys around grandma and has to pretend that she doesn't have boyfriends.\n\n\\*She can't listen to her favorite music around her because there are bad words or because it's too hard. She loves Rage Against the Machine and Cigarettes After Sex.\n\n\\*She was told by grandma that she must keep her bedroom blinds closed so nobody peeks in on her while changing (which would mean someone was in our backyard).\n\nThose are basically the only reasons she will admit to. My daughter is obviously 12 years old going on 25. She's very mature for her age and maybe grandma wants to keep things more age appropriate which I don't think is unreasonable.

I never really could get a word in but at first I was like no worries talk on. But this would really continue on and on to the point I told my wife I really don't like this guy and think maybe something is off. My wife and older daughter would say things like \"you are being mean\" \"why do you hate him\" random shit like that. Well I been pretty much saying since the start \"somethings not right with this guy\" and everyone I said something like this my wife and older daughter essentially said stop being mean. Well earlier tonight we found out through a neighbor there was an incident about 10 years ago but didn't say anything else and said look it up. Well my wife looked it up and found out that he was arrested about 10 years ago for soliciting sex from a 15 year old. Mind you he was about 45 at the time. I have two daughters and am ready to rip this guy's neck off. My wife is as pissed as I am. We were chatting with the neighbor parents and they don't seem to think it's a big deal. From the reports we read he set up a meet with a 15 year old and there was sexual intent per the police report we saw. A few other strange things were he's not considered a sex offender even today. Secondly he always says how broke he is but there was a 100k bail put on him for this incident 10 years ago and it was paid off immediately. \n\nSo I guess the reason for this post is I'm worried now about even going outside with my daughters.

With pregnancy you get so many comments but when you don\u2019t know the sex, everyone is dying to know what you\u2019re having. I started showing early and I work a very public facing job so I have certainly gotten my fair share of comments about the baby\u2019s gender and what people think I\u2019m having. But one thing I wasn\u2019t expecting was the general attitude towards boys vs. girls based on what the person commenting has themselves. To be honest, it\u2019s a really fascinating observation and something I never expected. I find it extremely interesting. \n\nFor example, when I talk to moms of both boys and girls, they will usually tell me the positive qualities of all of their children and tell me I\u2019ll be blessed either way. Many women will tell me it\u2019s really special to have a daughter, but otherwise there\u2019s really no preference or negativity.\n\nMoms of girls are usually similar. They\u2019ll usually either make a comment about how fun girls are or they\u2019ll tell me they\u2019re broke from buying all the girly stuff. But they\u2019re not usually negative about boys and they usually don\u2019t seem to have a preference for what the sex of my baby is.\n\nBut with moms of boys, it tends to be different. When boy moms talk about the sex of my baby, many are downright negative about raising girls, despite not having one of their own. I\u2019ve had several moms of boys tell me that girls are spoiled, catty, annoying, rude, and demanding. They tell me I\u2019m better off having boys like they do and they seem to really not want me to have a girl. Almost as if having a girl is a tragedy or something. It\u2019s really weird and makes me sad for my child if I do end up having a girl. I\u2019m not saying ALL moms of boys are like this by any means; not at all. But it\u2019s definitely a trend I\u2019ve noticed and one I\u2019ve found a little unusual to be honest. I will be happy with either sex but I\u2019ve always wanted a daughter and I just think it\u2019s odd that so many people without girls tend to see having a girl as a negative thing. \n\nAnyway, I just thought this was a really interesting observation and I discussed it casually with a few other expecting moms who said they\u2019d noticed the same trend. I\u2019m just wondering why it might be. Is it just a general disgust for girls and women rooted in misogyny? Is it jealousy? Has anyone else noticed this?",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "To me it's always seemed like a mix between internalized misogyny and women who actually really wanted a girl and are now dealing with their gender disappointment in a really weird and toxic way. \n\nLike another poster said I've never actually encountered this in real life just on social media. I don't think it's that widespread.",

        "content": "Edit for Update:\n\nWell, Reddit, this whole situation has turned into a parable of how modern technology is destroying childhood. \n\nBased on my own soul-searching and your feedback, I told my son he had to apologize directly to the girl. I gave him the option of doing it in person, or recording an apology message. He elected to record the message, and we sent it to the girl using my phone number. (My son doesn\u2019t have a phone).\n\nWell. Last night, my son was in tears of rage because earlier that day, the kid who had originally informed adults about the game was playing the apology message to other kids, in school, out loud, in deliberate earshot of my kid. The girl had obviously sent the message to the other kid and now that kid was using the recording to humiliate my child. \n\nI messaged the girl and asked how it was that the other kid ended up with the apology recording on their phone. She replied defensively and claimed the playing of the message was an accident and that my son took it all the wrong way and I should talk to my son before I go to her parents (which I vaguely hinted I may do). I told her I was upset with her behavior because I had taken her concerns seriously, and now she violated my trust by sharing the recording.\n\nBut at the end of the day, I\u2019m just asking myself how the fuck I got pulled into all this middle school adolescent sexuality and friendship texting drama when all I actually wanted to do was raise my child right. \n\nUgh. \n\nOriginal post: \nMy tween boy was identified as a participant in a game of \u201csmash or pass\u201d as overheard on a school bus. He was one of about 6 other boys who took turns weighing in girls they knew. One person named a girl, and everyone else had to choose. Smash here means \u201cdo stuff with\u201d (lord they can\u2019t even say \u201csex\u201d without dying of embarrassment) and pass is, well, pass. \n\nThe child who informed adults overheard the game, and was unhappy on behalf of a girl who was named. \n\nI need some diverse opinions here, since I am thoroughly confused on how to be a good parent to males in 2024. Is this a thing we no longer let boys do? Or is this a mild case of expected obnoxiousness that I ought not blow out of proportion?\n\nKindly asking parents to please back up your position thoughtfully.",

He did it when he was supposed to be on \u201cindependent time\u201d.  He was laughing about it when I asked what he was doing.  We asked him why he did it and asked if he wanted to wear them.  He said he was just interested in them. We said he can talk to us openly but please don\u2019t steal mom\u2019s clothes. That\u2019s never ok. \n\nFast forward to tonight and he tells me that he had another couple items hidden in his bed.  A random bra and a couple dresses. He never wore any of these items.  We told him he wasn\u2019t in trouble, we just wanted to know why he was hiding items in his bed.  He kind of smiled about it again as if it was a joke, and then he said he was just interested in them.  We asked why he never took \u201cdads\u201d clothes and he said because I have the clothes and colors he likes (basically mom\u2019s are different).  \n\nSo here we are trying to find information online about this and we can\u2019t find a lot.

I realize it\u2019s not a phase for everyone, of course, and I am a supporter and ally of the LGBTQ community to the best of my ability.  I was involved in the community when I was younger, having friends who are gay and bi and myself dating both sexes.  So, yeah, I\u2019m no stranger to it but have been out of it for many years since growing apart from those friends and exclusively being in a straight relationship for decades now.\n\nSo, here\u2019s the issue.

Why not give them a safe space be who they want to be?\u201d  But he disagrees wholeheartedly and feels it\u2019s disrespectful to the parents to call this kid a boy, who, when you look at them is clearly a girl.

        "content": "Hey,\n\nWe have an 11yo daughter, who originally I co-parented with her birth mother 50/50, my girlfriend at the time then moved in with us  and shortly after that the co-parenting changed to more like 80/20 that we had her as her birth mother is a trainee nurse and had to do we placements, meaning she wasn't around much. OK, we still would get a few days for us when her birth mother was at home to have her. \n\nTo note, my Fianc\u00e9e and daughter get on really well. \n\n**The background:**\n\nIn February 2023, our daughter poured her heart out to me on the drive home from school one afternoon and then to me and my Fianc\u00e9e that evening, about how she didn't want to live with, see or have any contact with her birth mother any more and she gave a lot of reasoning and had clearly thought about this a lot.\n\nI made notes, we recorded what was said and we were on a very thin line between her birth mother needing to be reported for child neglect & endangerment. I called her school the next day and told them what had happened the night before and I kept her off for a couple of days so that she could collect her thoughts, chill out and recoup from what she told as she was in pieces.  \n\nWe told her that OK, we'll keep her here a bit longer than she would have and tell her birth mother that she'd asked to stay longer and we need to sit, think, talk and go through everything that she told as there was a lot for us to unpack.\n\nMy Fianc\u00e9e and I thought, we talked and we agreed that with the information she's given us, if it's true (not doubting her, but we all embellish things at times), the only option is to honour her wishes, BUT she had to tell her birth mother, either on a video chat, a letter or somehow.\n\nIt ended up that the initial conversation was a video chat, where our daughter was beyond upset trying to say what she needed to, so I had to say the words and she nodded and agreed while crying her eyes out. This followed a letter that she wrote, hand written, where she wrote down why she made this decision. I met her birth mother and we sat and had coffee while we went through and she admitted to what our daughter was claiming, no embellishment, no lying, it was all true. \n\nSo our daughter now lives with us full time and has no contact with her birth mother. We have tried to encourage that maybe they just meet for a hot chocolate, in public with us sat either there with them, the other side of the room, whatever small morsel of contact, but our daughter is not interested at all.   \n\n\n**Now:**\n\nIts hard, its so hard going from co-parenting to full time parenting, especially with no time to prepare or even really process what's happened. I had been expecting this to come, but not for another few years as I had no idea things were so bad, so its been easier for me than my Fianc\u00e9e as this all happened in such a short space of time after she moved in.  \n\nShe's still struggling with all the added things being a full time parent brings with it, the lack of time for us, the teenage hormones & changes (like her being too lazy to brush her teeth), no break from being a parent as this isn't what the plan was, even the silly things like being able to run to the bathroom nekkid. Our sex life has been heavily impacted as we live in a small 2 bedroom flat and my Fianc\u00e9e hates that our daughter can probably hear what's going on and she old enough to understand what she's hearing.  \n  \nThere's also the back and forthing of what our daughter calls her, sometimes she refers to her as mum, other times she will introduce her as her step-mum & other times as her dad's girlfriend, but at home she's called by her name (which my Fianc\u00e9e is fine with). I've talked to our daughter about this and it's getting better slowly.\n\nFamily wise, I have 2 brothers, but 1 works shift patterns so isn't available to have our daughter much at all, my other brother has 2 kids of his own and doesn't really have the room to have her but he does every couple of months and my parents have passed away. My Fianc\u00e9e's parents live 4 hours away from us, so its not so easy for them to have her, although they sometimes have her in the school holidays for a few days for us.\n\nWe're having date nights again more now as we are able to leave our daughter at home for a little bit on her own, as she has her phone (and everyone's phone numbers), we have security in the home and she is very mature for her age, but we still don't have a healthy balance and I'm not sure what else to do.\n\n  \nDoes anyone have any idea's what we could do to help bring in a healthier balance for everyone?   \nAny suggestions, or anything will be greatly appreciated.\n\nTIA!

She practically never travelled due to her job and needing to be physically present there. during those 2 years there were some ups and downs, mainly due to the distance and language (she only speaks Italian... my italian is quite good but not perfect). I feel as though there were 80% good moments filled with love and 20% of moments that were fights. It might also be important to mention that she has many unresolved traumas (family neglect, ex-boyfriends and abandonment), but i didn't see the red flags as I was blinded by the passion and magic that i would often see in her eyes.\n\nAfter 1.5 years of dating, we jointly decided to have unprotected sex as we both want to have kids. After 6 months of unprotected sex, she became pregnant. When i found out about the news i was really excited... her not so much. I decided to come live with her in Italy. And ever since that moment a 180 shift occurred in her attitude towards me. it became 80% fights and tense moments vs 20% good moments. Just to give you an example, since she became pregnant she has kissed me only three times and hugged me even less. Its been 8 months now since she became pregnant. She is healthy and we found out its a boy. In the first 3 months, i had to come to terms with myself that it is no longer about me anymore... I have to do what's right for my son and for the mother of my son who will also indirectly have an impact on my son. So i put my love for Portugal, the passions and friends i had there aside to be present in Italy for her and my son, holding on to hope as much as possible that maybe we could make this relationship work. It has been really difficult emotionally. I do not have any fiends here and I do not get any emotional support from my gf whatsoever. she has even a few times mentioned that she never loved me and that she wishes that i was not the father. I am not a bad person... if you ask any of my friends and family, they will tell you that i am a very kind, peaceful and loving person. So i sucked it up and took the hits because she is going through a transformational roller coaster that i will never understand. I did the grocery shopping, i cleaned, i washed the clothes, i did all the driving, i was there for her emotionally when she rarely reached out, and all while being submerged by my work. We found a new appartment to move into because the current place is too small. We will be moving into the new place after the birth. Maybe also important to objectively mention that she makes minimum wage while i maybe make 5-6 times what she makes.\n\nWhat is the right thing to do? do i put my unhappiness aside and persist through this loveless relationship with the mother of my child for the sake of my son? or do I step away from the relationship and live on my own terms and find my happiness?\n\nI really do not like the mentality of the people here in Bergamo Italy, they are stubborn, non-accepting, not open minded and way too proud... there is so much ego all over the place. My heart trully is in Portugal where people are kind, welcoming and happy. I have tried many times to convince her to move to Portugal and live in the house i own there, where i know we could be happy, but these have been futile attempts. \n\nIn my mind, i decided to suck it up for at least the first 1-2 years of my childs life, as he will need all the help he can get. Then... i don't know... but i cannot keep going on like this forever\n\nAre long distance father son relationships possible? and how?",

        "content": "I suppose it was about 3 years ago my wife and I noticed that our daughter would frequently come out of her room at night. Repeated trips to the bathroom, or to come into our room to say she couldn't sleep. I wouldn't say it was every night, but it was pretty frequent. We took it at face value. Whenever my wife and I showed any affection it was met with \"eww gross\", \"stop\" reactions. Which we considered normal for a girl of that age. \n\n  \nAgain this is still about 3 years ago I was having some sleeping issues and my wife and I were discussing melatonin or something. I made the comment that it doesn't work that long for me. She mentioned that she could wake me up at 1am to take it. I guess my daughter only heard the \"wake you at 1am\" and she stormed out very upset. We tried to approach her and ask her about her feelings. Asking what was going on, why she was feeling this way. She was hard-crying and almost yelling. At that point it came to light that she had overheard my wife and I having sex one night in the past. We were unaware of this. I should also mention it was about this time in her life that sex came up from a teacher at school, but very high level, sex was for making babies. So things started to click. I guess she had heard us and then for a long time would come out of her room to check on us. I suppose to check that our door was open? But the reason for this outburst was apparently in her mind she heard \"wake you at 1am\" and thought we were planning sex. We addressed it compassionately, I feel.  We talked through it. I thought subconsciously she was afraid we were trying to have another baby. This was during covid times and things were all virtual and we thought maybe it was a good idea for her to see a therapist on betterhelp. She agreed to it. We were there for the first visit to explain but the rest of their visits we respected her confidentiality. Just asking \"How'd it go?\" etc.. She had some visits, said she had taken away everything she could. So we agreed to stop the meetings. The middle of the night checks went away.\n\n  \nFast forward to a month ago. She is now almost 14. She's had the official sex talks at school. We've kind of discussed it at home too. My wife and her had the talk about her body and maybe some things boys would start talking about, etc. So one evening it was late and we thought she was sleeping. I thought I had locked the door, obviously that wasn't the case. My wife and I were discreet, fully under the covers, but all I here is the door open. She said \"bruh\" and stormed out. They crying and the outrage came next.\n\nMy wife and I quickly brainstormed on how to approach it. We decided to go with honesty. We told her we were sorry. We said that she may be feeling embarrassed and we were very embarrassed too. She was saying things like \"how could she do this to me again\" \"I trusted her\" \"I won't be able to sleep\". We let her cool down for a bit and we regrouped. We approached again and asked if we could enter her room. We understood the embarrassment and told her that we didn't have to look at each other but we would like for her to hear us. This time we took the approach of this is how two consenting adults show that they love each other. It happens in a healthy adult relationship. If her concern is that we are trying to have another baby that is no longer possible. Things seemed like they really deescalated. \n\nMy wife just got a text from my daughter saying she was really hesitant to say something, but she knows that she can tell her anything. Saying that she is scared at night again. She is afraid of coming out of her room because she doesn't want to catch us. She says going to bed stresses her out because if she doesn't fall asleep she might hear us. She said she doesn't want to go to therapy but it's gotten really bad. We're not sure what to do at this point or how to address it. \n\nAny ideas?",

Both of us near 40s. \nWe don't have extended family nearby.. so it's 2 adults and 2 kids. Both of us work full time. Wife is 100% remote , I go to office 2 days a week. Elder one goes to preschool M- T 4 hrs a day. We have a babysitter who comes M-F 9 to 5.  After she leaves, it's up to us. One of us take kids outside ( depending upon weather), other one prepares dinner. We do dinner, followed by their bath & sleep. We are totally exhausted by the end of the day. \n\nGoes without saying our personal life has taken a toll.Even our conversations are usually around kids, their classes,  activities, future. More like we some totally forgot about ourselves.  Living life as a parent. More for mom, less for me. I started going to office 6 months ago, so I am getting some me time, wife not so much. \n\nSince the birth of LO, we are very overwhelmed. It's been close to 2 years now. Even when we took vacation,  kids were with us. It was refreshing but as a family. As husband-wife, we did not get any relaxing time. \n\nFor almost last 2 years, we were content with once a month sex.  Whenever we got chance, it was just a quickie. No foreplay, do it and get back to sleep.\n\nSomehow in last 2 weeks , we were able to get 2 good long sessions . I can't explain what it did, but I can't get her out of my mind. I guess sex reconnected me to her emotionally. In addition to wanting more sex, I want to hold her, cuddle with her, spend time with her.\n\n At the same time, we have small kids, they need us. \nShe is a mom, she has more stuff to handle. I don't know how is she feeling emotionally. She hardly gets time for herself, it helps me being her last priority.  I never minded it. \n\nAnd because we do it so less , she usually don't say no. Plus, we keep it to max 1 per month. I see how exhausted she gets every day. I don't feel like pushing her. Now, I am realizing I have been missing her emotionally and physically.\n\nI floated an idea to her that we arrange babysitter for few hours one evening and go for a date. Rekindle our personal life.  \n\nIn your experience,  when were you able to go back to pre kids bedroom life? How you dealt with tough phase. \n\nTldr: small kids 2,  sex life 0. \nNot a native English speaker.. possible some of my sentences give different meaning.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "As mentioned in another comment, have the babysitter take the baby out for a few hours during the day while your other child is at preschool. Have a lunch \u201cdate\u201d at home before you are both too tired. Sounds like you\u2019re very empathetic and gentle with your wife which is great. But I just think, if my husband didn\u2019t initiate sex (or sometimes pester me, LOL) our sex life would be in trouble. In a way I\u2019m glad he still pursues me, even when I\u2019m exhausted or not in the mood, because it reminds me of the importance of staying physically and emotionally connected. Good luck!",

She gets along with my wife, who works from home, our daughter (5 months) loves her. She gets excited when she comes in the house. The situation has worked very well so far. During interviews we did our due diligence. Called references and previous employer. She was a director at a local daycare. They all had very positive things to say.\n\nThen we were alerted to some information about her boyfriend. A friend of a friend told us that she has a now 10 year old boy with this guy and he has not seen the kid since the hospital birth. But worse is he has a record. Sexual assault of his 11 yeat old cousin when he was 17 then reckless driving which killed his passenger. He spent several years in jail and had to register as a sex offender for 10 years. He dropped her and picked her up and our house. Never any contact with our daughter. But we have concern of pictures on her cell phone and other kids on the street too.\n\nWe are considering firing her as if she knows his history there is a serious lack of judgement. And why would she choose to work in childcare and be attached to him? \nOur question is, do we alert the other family (3 kids) that she Nanny\u2019s for on the other days?\n\nUpdate: The person that alerted us, baby mama, has the child with the boyfriend.

Me and my gf recently finished school at the doctoral level and have become licensed and gotten jobs making a combined 160k per year at ages 26 and 25 respectively. We practice safe sex habits but she is not on any form of birth control so obviously there\u2019s always the risk that something may happen. We met in college and began dating in our last 2 years. We hit it off excellently and she truly is my best friend and my person that I want to spend the rest of my life with. Well earlier this week she tested positive after her first test being negative roughly a week and a half late on her period. We had planned on having children down the road and both 100% wanted to be parents and regularly talk about our future, however this was out of the order and a bit earlier than either of us had planned. The primary concern I have for us at this time is we live roughly an hour apart and don\u2019t have housing yet. Anyway we sounded all the alarms yesterday and informed both of our parents of the situation and luckily even though everyone is surprised they couldn\u2019t be happier and more supportive of us. Today she went to her OBGYN for further testing and after they looked at the urine tests they informed her that they can\u2019t actually determine if she truly is pregnant because of how faint the line is. They are sending her for bloodwork which will obviously give a more definitive answer but in the mean time the unknown is like this looming shadow over us. In discussions with her the past couple days she has expressed the stresses and concerns of how much she doesn\u2019t feel ready for all of the life changes that are coming our way if she is pregnant. I keep trying to be her rock but I can\u2019t lie all of the thoughts and expectations are getting to me too and I\u2019m stressed as hell which I\u2019m assuming is normal regardless of how prepared one may feel. I just feel awful because she has expressed after all those years of school and hard work she wanted to be \u201cselfish\u201d and just enjoy our lives for a little before having kids so right now we\u2019re stuck in this weird limbo of not wanting to hope she isn\u2019t pregnant but also not wanting to find out that she IS pregnant at the same time. I understand that we are FAR from being in a tough spot that other surprise pregnancies can find themselves in so I guess I\u2019m just looking for reassurance/ words of encouragement for two possible soon to be parents who are just freaking out a bit. I greatly appreciate any advice. Thank you all in advance!!",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "I feel I should also add that we have agreed abortion is not an option. We will raise this child together despite any hardships that may come along with it. I also understand that we are far from any kind of additional stresses and financial burdens that others have had to deal with(including my own parents who had me when they were only 19). Honestly I feel kind of bad even posting this because I feel like I\u2019m complaining over nothing but I also feel that typing this out is cathartic in a way. And I\u2019ve always wanted to be a father so I really am ok with whatever news we here about everything I just wish I had better ways to calm her nerves and put her mind at ease as she is my number 1 priority in life and the easier I can make this whole process on her the better.

        "title": "A Straight Mess",
        "content": "First time poster. \n\nGonna give a little back story. So I 28F had just broke off a 10+ year on and off again relationship with the love of my life 27M. There were cases of infidelity and tons of pain caused by both parties more my fault than his. I\u2019ve since then have really realized everything he did and the ways he loved someone who was caused by so much trauma and was extremely hard to love. I know I was hard to love but we were also very young through the course of that. We\u2019ve since then have had 2 beautiful children and of course do everything in our power to raise them the ways we want to filled with so much love and guidance that they deserve. Since the breakup, my heart has done a whole flip along with all the damage I did to him especially after speaking to my father who went through something similar with my mother. Her in general caused so much friction for he and I as teenagers all the way into adulting and parenting our own children. She\u2019s caused harm with my brother and even my own children as well as him. Yet, he still loved me unconditionally while I was doing wrong. My heart so pure and only fighting for him wanting to get my last chance to love him the same way he loved me if not more. We still tell eachother we love each other when we\u2019re together and not. We have moments of good communication along with moments of no communication but yet we still make sure we say it once a day. Well, here\u2019s where it gets shitty. \n\nA week and a day after we broke up and he left our home. He met someone. 2 weeks prior without my knowledge the children have noticed her name in his phone, heard him call her babe, the FaceTimes the whole nine. I found out sitting next to him and seeing the I love you text between the two of them. She is also 27F. I\u2019m not knocking someone can fall in love that fast but he didn\u2019t give himself enough time alone. 3 weeks from them meeting against our agreement that he would wait to bring her around our children he does it anyways without my knowledge. Our children had told me instead of him even tho I was next to him 2 days after that all day. Trust with our children was broken cause they are still processing the immediate change in their parents and haven\u2019t had the full chance to be able to work through it. Now there\u2019s a whole new woman in their face. She\u2019s been around our children without her own daughter twice. Playing house, the whole nine. Our children have not been handling it all well at all, son started experiencing nightmares. Another issue to play in that is that they have been breaking up and getting back together numerous times and we\u2019ve been consistently having sex throughout the whole 4 months as well. He admits he\u2019s confused but there\u2019s so much this woman doesn\u2019t know. I arranged to speak with her about the children and get her side so I see where the truth actually is. But, what\u2019s hindering things even more is that he\u2019s hella nervous about us speaking cause he knows she\u2019ll ask question not portaning to the children and if she is to ask these questions I will open and honestly answer them. Of course I have questions outside of the children I would want answers but I\u2019m not walking into the door with that in my mind. My reason to meet her is the children first but if the conversation shifts that way then so be it. They have since then had a pregnancy scare 3 months in as well. He isn\u2019t helping with the children that are alive but to want to bring another one into the world with his crazy work schedule isn\u2019t fair to the woman and baby. Thankfully, as of now no baby is in the picture besides the 3 we have combined. My heart is so deeply entangled in him regardless and will wait for him. I\u2019m grieving the loss of it, and the possibilities of them making it a distance but there\u2019s just so much to fast and he doesn\u2019t see that. Even when I subtract myself from the situation altogether our children are struggling and hurting and that\u2019s not being taken into account at all and that hurts even more. I have moments where I want to completely just take our children and leave, move states and just start over the 3 of us being I have no energy to start anything fresh with how my heart is dealing with everything. I\u2019m healing, struggling and all. Our lease is up in July and it\u2019s either move in with him or my children and I be homeless he wants us all with him but he knows it\u2019s been hard for his relationship with her already proven insecurities about he and I. Woman\u2019s inituition  is truly something when you have a mind of an over thinker like she and I do, it\u2019s just gonna blow up when the truth comes out. I\u2019ve learned the truth about things I\u2019ve been dreaming about and just in general I\u2019ve been right every time. So I know her mind is doing the same only difference is she just truly doesn\u2019t know much of anything she\u2019s still in the puppy stage with this man where everything is amazing and they are so happy. I\u2019m also not doing anything to hinder their relationship in anyway. It\u2019s all just a mess. Idk if I need advice or just to vent. I struggle to make it through day by day for the kids and try to pick myself off the ground as much as possible some days are harder than others. Especially knowing, he may or may not come back even after getting over her. Only reason I\u2019m saying that is because he\u2019s said he\u2019s torn between the two of us and loves both of us.  Thanks for reading if you read this long. I\u2019m asking for some advice as this is all new to me and is constantly changing every day if not weekly for us.",

I'm not against her reading about sex but this is pretty out there for a 14yo especially since the characters are only 11 (I don't want to give any spoilers so trying to be vague). Normally I'd read/watch something prior to screen it but I hate horror so wanted to get some opinions before making a decision. I normally trust her judgment and let her make her own decisions about what she can handle but I'm not so sure on this one. \n\nAlso worth noting, the only reason she's interested is bc a couple friends have watched it and were talking about it.

My son is the polar opposite and seems to attract very smart, independent and highly motivated, athletic females and zero drama. For that, I am so proud. I have had the sex talk and all that jazz. I know they are not having sex. They have been dating for 4 months. She is an only child (as is my son) and comes from a good family. I have met her parents and I know her uncle personally for many years. I have always had the rule of having the privacy when hanging out, but the door remains open. Today her parents approached me about how I feel with my son attending their summer home over the summer over 2 hours away for a weekend here and there. They go out there all summer the day after school ends and return a week before school starts (by the time they go out there they would be dating 6-8 months). I\u2019m not sure how to feel about this. I trust him, but I also know how teenage hormones are. I\u2019m also still trying to comprehend what is and what is not okay rule wise. I grew up with a strict Catholic upbringing and rebelled once I hit 15 as my mom was extremely strict. \n\nAnyways, I\u2019m not sure how to feel about this. I asked them to give me some time to think about it. They have made it clear she will not be in the city at all during the summer. Unfortunately with the travel time of about 2.5 hours each way, I wouldn\u2019t be able to drop and pick him up for a day visit given my work schedule. \n\nEDIT: they have known each other for 4 years as friends, but only recently started dating. \n\nFURTHER EDIT: I have a very close relationship with my son and he does come to me with everything. I know right now they are not having sex yet. I am aware if they are going to have sex, they will- but I guess my ultimate fear is the pregnancy part (where I\u2019m from if you are pregnant under 18, child protective services does get involved and the males parents legally become financially responsible child support wise to the pregnant female- and I am absolutely in no financial ability to pay this). I have spoken to him about contraception, etc. He is a birth control fail baby and I found out I was pregnant at 20 weeks. It was a huge surprise (and I still had my period) and fluke that I found out- 17 years later I still can\u2019t comprehend how two sets of birth control possibly failed. I didn\u2019t start showing until 30 weeks. I guess my strict upbringing has caused me a lot more grief in adulthood than I thought as I don\u2019t know what is considered okay, and what is not. I have a personal ultimate fear of my son going through what I did so young and I don\u2019t wish that on anyone.",

        "title": "Thoughts On Having A Second Child",
        "content": "TLDR: If you were torn about having a second child and ending up having a second, how did it go? Specifically looking at a 4-5 year age gap.\n\nI know there's probably a million posts exactly like this one, and I've read a few, but I want to ask some more specific questions. Please be truthful, but kind. \n\nI've always felt torn about having a second child. Until recently, I thought maybe we'd be one and done. As much as I love the idea of the simplicity of one child (truly, I do), it also makes me sad to think of how lonely my daughter's life could be as she gets older. I personally grew up with a big family - one brother, 18 cousins on one side of my family, and 4-5 on the other (we were pretty close and played together quite often, especially in the summers). My husband has a brother and sister, and quite a few cousins as well. Our daughter does not have this. She has one cousin - a boy who is much older than her (by almost 10 years), and this will likely be her only cousin. None of my cousins with kids live closer than 2+ hours away. I would really love for my daughter to have a sibling in life, and I know I shouldn't have another baby for my child, but it is something I want, too. Even though my brother and I aren't best friends (especially growing up...), I find so much comfort in knowing I can reach out to him. He lives many states away but visits twice a year, and in between we play games virtually from time to time. I would love for my daughter (and our second child) to have that - for them to have each other in life. I know they could end up disliking each other, but I also feel like it's up to the parent to foster a loving relationship between them.\n\nAnyways...my husband and I always said we'd play it by ear, and that ideally we'd like a 5 year age gap and that would give us lots of time to decide. My daughter just turned 3 a little over a week ago, and a month or two ago I could just start to really see the possibility of having a second. Now, just within the last week or two, I feel like I could have a second, and my husband says he'd actually like to maybe try for a 4 year age gap instead (which I am starting to agree with - but that's IF things go smoothly and we get pregnant quickly - our daughter was a first try baby). For perspective, I'm currently 32 and he's 36. I'm sure seeing a bunch of people around me having babies and getting pregnant is influencing me. Oh, and my daughter has actually started to say she wants a baby sister (I would love that, and we've already started talking about how we don't get to choose the gender, lol). So I have all of that influencing me right now. I'm just so torn...I feel like if we did decided to be one and done, I could regret that later in life, and I don't want to have kids late in my 30s. But I also feel like I could possibly regret having a second, and I feel like that regret would be far worse. I'm sure I'm just wayyy overthinking everything (that's what I do), but it is a big decision. \n\nHere are my biggest worries:\n\n- My daughter is my whole world. I can't imagine dividing my time between her and another baby. I fear I'll resent my second baby and that my daughter will resent me AND the baby. This is my greatest fear. \n\n- I know it will be hard, no matter what. I'm in an \"expect the worst, hope for the best\" mindset. I do fear that I will struggle with not having enough time for myself, or that my marriage will crumble. I also worry if I can handle it mentally.  I fear the stress/pressure/overwhelm could just make me a worse mother. I am currently a SAHM (I left my job just before my daughter turned 2). \n\n- I hate to even write this, but I'm slightly afraid of gender disappointment. I'm not a shallow person at all, and ultimately I truly just want a health baby. With our first pregnancy, I was indifferent about the gender. I've always wanted a girl, but was convinced I was having a boy (we kept the sex a surprise). Now with one daughter, I would prefer to have another girl (we have all girl stuff already, and I like the idea of a sister-sister relationship, etc.). My daughter also has expressed wanting a sister and that plays into it as well. I would also love a baby boy and can see the pros of that as well. We would find out the sex before birth this time around, and I think that would help me prepare mentally more and help me prepare my daughter mentally to have a brother or a sister. Has anyone else felt this way? If you have a daughter-son combo with the daughter being older, how is their relationship?\n\nI know so many of my fears can be lessened slightly with prep work before a second baby arrives, and I can shift my mindset to be more positive if/when we become pregnant with our second/once we commit to trying for a second, but there's only so much prep work you can do. I would really appreciate other's perspectives on this. It seems like something that people just do without much thought, but it is a HUGE change. It's easy to get wrapped up into the excitement of choosing baby names, clothes, etc. and overlooking the potential downsides. \n\nThanks in advance (and sorry for the novel)!",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "I see so much of myself in this! Currently 33 and my husband just turned 39.  We had our daughter in 2020 and it took us a while to feel ready for a second. I come from a large blended family (1 of 7) and while I never wanted that many kids, I always knew I wanted more than one. But after we had our daughter, we were on the fence. My husband would have been happy with just one, and we had a lot of the same concerns you do. Unfortunately I don't have any advice because we ultimately decided to go for it and I'm due with our second in August, and they will have a 4.5 year age gap. I was actually pregnant and due this past February, but lost the baby at 14 weeks. \n\nI totally feel you on gender disappointment. I knew this would be our last baby, and I had a feeling I'd grieve a little either way. Either I'd get the experience of having a son (and my daughter would never get a sister) or she'd have a sister (and I'd never get to experience a son). We're having a girl, and while there's a tiny part of me that's sad to miss out on son stuff, it's very small. I'm pumped to be a girl mom.\n\nYour concerns are valid and to be honest, they're still concerns I have even now that I'm pregnant. We were worried about splitting time with a new baby, and having that take time from our older daughter. I worry about the toll it'll take on us, but I worry about that less with a larger age gap. My daughter is so good at entertaining herself at this age and she's fairly independent. I still worry about having a baby with special needs and what that might mean. There are SO MANY unknowns honestly, but I know this is what feels right for our family. Just like we adapted to becoming parents, we will adapt to becoming parents of two.",

We eventually got full custody and been going through the motions of being parents to a teenager that we have know their entire life. We always tried to have an environment of openness and honesty in the year since this wonderful girl moved in with us. Unfortunately, she ended up making a mistake and is now pregnant. We never trying to push not having sex, because abstinence just doesn't work. We hoped that when she though she was ready we can have an honest discussion but this unfortunately didn't happen. I'm worried for my little girl. She is so young and had her whole life ahead of her. Its strange to me, as one of the extremely few male influences in her life, that people are celebrating it, maybe that is on me. I'm not happy that she is pregnant but i let it be known i will NEVER turn my back on her. I am disappointed and upset but I will be here. We've talked about all the options available (shoutout to my wife) and she ultimately wants to keep the baby. After many hours of talking we explained that we are not here to raise the baby. We will help so she can go to school and eventually college, but this is your baby and you have to raise them. Her boyfriend said that he wants to stick around and we have a date set so we can all talk, including his parents, to establish a support system. I don't have high hopes of a 15 year old boy staying to be a father, and that scares the hell out of me. I don't want to make this worse or breed any doubt in my child's mind that we wont be there for her. What can i do make sure she feels loved, taken care of, and help her ultimately finish school and college.?\n\nEdit: goodness that that way more traction than I thought it would. I hope I was able to reply to everyone. Thank you to everyone who provided solid advice and words of encouragement. You people are gods gift truly. \n\nEdit 2: I was not prepared for all the abortion comments. I know it's an option as well as open and closed adoption. We've looked and discussed them with our child and just me and my wife. Thank you all for the suggestion but abortion is just not a road she wants to travel down.

My kids were told if they don\u2019t change who they are, then they won\u2019t be accepted and loved. If we really want to support our children, we should be teaching them that they are loved and accepted as they are and that they don\u2019t need to become something they\u2019re not to be accepted.\n\nMy kids have told me they\u2019re actually AFRAID to tell anyone they\u2019re straight or non trans, for fear of being accused of being a \u201cphobe.\u201d\n\nSupporting someone should not involve attacking someone else. American Girl has NEVER used their stories of standing up for what they believe in by attacking others. \n\nWe need to be spreading awareness, support, and encouragement to accept yourself as you are.

        "content": "This is a follow-up of a post last week: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1c5n99o/5yo\\_daughter\\_changing\\_boy\\_babies/?sort=new](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1c5n99o/5yo_daughter_changing_boy_babies/?sort=new)\n\nIt was a discussion of my 5 yo girl \"helping\" a friend change her 2yo boy and the discussion we had. My view was that a 5yo girl should see male genitals long before she starts thinking about sex. She has no brothers, and my husband and I are separated, so she does not see him naked.\n\nMy friend, the mother of two boys, after a discussion, agreed with me. She has a two yo boy and a baby boy. I was visiting her again (we are close friends) and I had my little girl and my baby girl with me. The time came for me to change my baby girl's diaper, so I did that in the presence of her boy (the mother's idea). She encourged him to \"help.\" He asked his mother \"where is her penis?\" So she explained to him that boys and girls are different, that girls have vulvas and boys have penises.\n\nShe agreed with me that kids should know about anatomy long before they are old enough to think about sex. Body parts should be thought of as body parts, not just sex organs.\n\nWe have both had talks with our kids about privacy, that you don't just show that part of your body (things covered by bathing suits and underwear) to others, but that it is normal and ok for people changing babies, parents, siblings, nurses, and doctors to see private parts. We have both talked about \"good touch-bad touch\" and such.\n\nYes, we will both continue to talk to our kids about gender differences, puberty changes, periods (she agreed that little boys, many of whom have older sisters, should know about periods.), and other things. Eventually, the talks will include sex and \"the birds and bees.\"",
        "most_upvoted_comment": ">she agreed that little boys, many of whom have older sisters, should know about periods\n\nTrust me, from a guy's perspective, it has nothing to do with older sisters.\n\nA lot of us become Dads one day. Some of us are blessed with daughters. And, speaking from experience, some of us get to do the parenting thing solo. Believe me when I say, we get next to no primers on \"female hygiene\" in most of the world, because it's considered a taboo topic for men and boys. The amount of shit I had to learn as an adult man that \\*really\\* should have been taught to me at a much younger age was unreal.\n\nSo yes, boys should get a lot more education in this than they do (and helping out with childcare is also an excellent idea - that's another area boys are frequently excluded from, much to their and society's detriment).",

I know at this age masturbation is normal. She\u2019s already gotten her periods and she\u2019s almost 12. No she is NOT exposed to sexual content and she has literally NEVER heard her father and I have sex (I\u2019ll be abstinent before that happens, judge me I don\u2019t care, I have childhood trauma about that topic). So clearly this is a normal pubescent thing that she\u2019s exploring. My concern isn\u2019t that she\u2019s doing so, because it\u2019s natural and everyone I know started around her age. My concern is that it might be unhygienic and I don\u2019t want her to hurt herself. If you\u2019ve had a pubescent preteen, and either, one experienced this, or two would understand if this happened to you, what would you do?\n\nI feel it would be highly inappropriate to give her a dildo or something to use instead (cringing just even typing that).

        "most_upvoted_comment": "Hey there,\n\nI want you to know that you're not alone in facing these challenges, and I commend you for your strength and resilience in taking on the role of a single father at such a young age. It's clear that you've been through a lot, but I want to assure you that healing is possible, and brighter days are ahead.\n\nFirst and foremost, it's important to prioritize your mental and emotional well-being. This may involve seeking support from friends, family members, or a therapist who can provide a safe space for you to express your feelings and work through your emotions. Talking about your experiences and receiving validation and support can be incredibly healing.\n\nAdditionally, make self-care a priority in your life. This means taking time for yourself to engage in activities that bring you joy and relaxation, whether it's going for a walk, practicing mindfulness or meditation, or pursuing a hobby that you enjoy. Taking care of yourself physically, emotionally, and spiritually will help you cope with stress and heal from the pain you've experienced.\n\nIt's also important to set boundaries with your ex-partner and prioritize your own well-being and the well-being of your child. While co-parenting can be challenging, focusing on what's best for your child and maintaining healthy boundaries can help reduce stress and conflict.\n\nRemember to be patient with yourself and give yourself grace as you navigate through this journey. Healing takes time, and it's okay to take things one day at a time. Celebrate your progress, no matter how small, and acknowledge the strength and resilience that you've shown in facing adversity.\n\nLastly, don't hesitate to reach out for support whenever you need it. Whether it's from friends, family, or a professional, there are people who care about you and want to help you through this difficult time.\n\nYou are stronger than you realize, and you have the power to overcome the challenges you're facing. Keep moving forward, and know that brighter days are ahead.\n\nTake care,",

        "content": "I have two girls, 1yo and 5 yo. My 5yo knows about certain sex differences (men shave or grow beards, women have boobs and have babies, etc) but didn't know about genital differences.\n\nI have a close friend that I often have lunch with. She has a 5yo son and an almost 2yo son.\n\nThe last time, at her house, by 5yo girl was playing with her 5yo son. She had to change her younger son, still in diapers. My daughter asked, \"Can I help.\" The other mother said, \"Ask your mommy\" and then looked at me. I said \"OK.\" The other mother seemed surprised but agreed. So my daughter \"helped.\" (handed the mom a new diaper, put the wet one in the trash, made faces and entertained the baby, etc.)\n\nLater we were discussing it (while our 5yo's were playing. She expressed surprise that I would allow my girl to help and see a baby boy naked. My friend only had a sister, no brothers. I grew up with two brothers. When I was 5, I was bathed with my older (then 6yo) brother and helped bathe and change my younger brother. So, at that age, I certainly knew about male anatomy, if not what it was used for.\n\nI really had not thought about it until then, but my girl had not seen a baby boy's genitals. She is in our church's nursery, but the only babies there are girls. I think that it is best that she sees and learns about such things before she equates anatomy with sex. As we drove home she did ask about what she saw that was different from the girls. I explained what a penis was and told her that boys have them. That is just another difference.\n\nI wonder--who has the best attitude? Me, thinking that it is best that girls know about boy's anatomy when still very young, or her, who doesn't think that girls should be exposed to such?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

        "content": "TLDR, step son sneaking out with gf, she is manipulative and we have tried cutting her off. He has zero respect for boundaries despite our open communication with him of our life experiences. Aside from therapy, is there more that we can do?\n\nTo preface, 16yr old step-son has had a somewhat tumultuous life. I married my wife when he was 4 years old. But his dad, who lives 3 states away and has minimal contact, is extremely narcissistic to the point of sociopath and a convicted sex offender/felon. Due to so many issues with that and despite a stable upbringing with my wife and I, it\u2019s pretty easy to see that he might have some trauma.\n\nAt the beginning of the school year, he met a girl. Started dating her and when we met her we felt there were some red flags but welcomed her anyways. As time went on, son\u2019s attitude became worse and worse. He was obviously become more and more depressed and not doing anything except talk and hang out with gf. He was becoming more and more delinquent at school and even though we got after him for that, he would improve for a time, but then just start walking out of class again whenever he wanted. \n\nHe has been caught sneaking out before with friends, but it was somewhat innocent things, going on drives, going to McDonald\u2019s. But we were suspecting that something else was going on. I got some cameras and not even a couple days later caught him coming home from sneaking out at 5am. At this point we felt it justified in looking at his phone to see what his communication was like. We discovered that he was constantly sneaking out to see his gf, was having unsafe sex with her, they were sexting and she was sending him some pretty explicit videos. Most disturbingly the things the gf was saying/doing looked like things my wife experienced with her ex. \n\nWe sat him down and confronted him. Of course he was an obstinate teenager but was seemingly straightforward about his indiscretions. But we told him how difficult it was for us to trust him because of how much he has been lying. We took his phone and grounded him from seeing her. But then he goes to school and starts skipping class to see her, would forcibly take his sisters phone to send her quick messages, use his school provided Chromebook to email her. No matter how much we tried to cut off communication with her and explain why, he was constantly trying to find ways to get around those restrictions. As time went on and we discovered the communications, we would discover the gf lying and throwing our son and his friends under the bus. From reliable sources we also heard that the gf was basically the school \u201cbicycle\u201d. \n\nIt was obvious to us the manipulative behavior of this girl and how much she has our son twisted around her fingers. We are getting our son into therapy to hopefully help him to unravel the reality of his life and help him to discover the trauma he has suffered. But honestly, we feel we are in over our heads. He def needs to detox from this girl. I have seen others blast other parents for invading their children\u2019s privacy, but in my opinion, if our child\u2019s well-being is being harmed, we have every right and a responsibility to help him and protect him. Ideally, this experience can be a spring board for his entrance into responsible adulthood. But at the same time there is emotional external and self harm occurring. \n\nHe has zero respect for boundaries. He has clearly disregarded my wife\u2019s trauma with his father. We have always been open and frank with what we expect and the experiences we and others have had when suffering the negative consequences of our actions. He is deluded that this will all blow over and in the next week or so will be back to hanging with \u201cfriends\u201d. In the time he has been cut off from his phone, he has had zero friends contact him or reach out. To me that makes me so sad how isolated his gf has made him.\n\nWe want to help him more and really show him we care. I understand it will take time and effort on our part but is there more we can do?",

        "most_upvoted_comment": "Friend, I understand the need to protect your children.  Particularly, the very idea of child sexual assault is nauseating.  \n\nHowever, it has never been safer to be a child, and a *vast* majority of child sexual assault happens with relatives or other adults that were supposedly well known and trusted.  \n\nIn the real picture of what you need to focus on, those neighborhood sex offenders are way, way low down on the list.  \n\nMake certain your rear facing car seats are good, that your kids wear helmets when playing with scooters and balance bikes.  Bolt the shelves and bureaus to the wall to prevent climbing injury.  Get your kids vaccinated.  Figure out the front yard situation in your neighborhood and how to prevent your kids from running into the road.  Don't leave animals and small children unattended.  \n\nAsk the landlord if there are a handful of trusted teens in the area that he would recommend as \"mother's helpers\" to get paid $10/ hour to play with your kids while you guys are home but can focus on unpacking and doing house work.  You'll get a sense of who would be a good full fledged baby sitter for when you need a night out.  \n\nStop by the city hall or town library to ask for a list of local parent meetings, a reading circle at the library or walk in the park with your kids.  That'll get you tapped into all the inside info about where's good to bring the kids.   \n\nWhile I absolutely share your goal of protecting children, the current US sex offender registry has not been shown to be effective at all.  In fact, the opposite.  When tracked, having the offender registries be police- only in place of public knowledge strongly correlates with *decreased* re-offense.  Over and over, public registries don't decrease offense.",

It's typically just one parent as we live a pretty routine life during the school year. \n\nThere are times when I have both kids commuting with me or I'll have them hang at my place on occasion and I see them interact and it's super cringe! I could totally understand with they were two little kids but the fact that she's very mature for her age (physically and mentally) and her brother is going to be a freshman in high school soon is just very very odd to me. When they're together they talk in weird child-like voices to each other and are constantly in each other's faces. They will kiss at each other playfully and kiss on the lips on occasion. They are always touching foreheads and holding hands. Again it all seemed fine when they were toddlers but at this age it's super weird for me and I can't stop cringing. When I was 13 I was definitely not behaving that way with my siblings... like that's the age where I was growing up and hanging out with the opposite sex more, experimenting etc. I think about how I talked and acted at that age and it makes this kid seem light years behind. And maybe he is a late bloomer who knows. \n\nI've considered like maybe her older brother is just more immature for his age and hasn't quite grown out of that stuff yet? I'm trying to keep an open mind. It just seems like no one has ever pointed out boundaries for them maybe? On one hand it's nice that they are close siblings so that's comforting to know but still I can't really wrap my mind around this behavior. I asked my daughter if they behave that way at home and she said yes. I think the expectation in my mind would be that an older brother would be the more mature one and be kind of a protector of his younger sister but he kind of goes down to her maturity level and it's just so bizarre to see them so physical together. \n\nSo I'm not really sure what to do or say or if I should say anything at all and just let it be. I'm afraid I'll come off in a negative way if I raise it to the other parents in the picture but maybe there's a way to bring it up from a neutral stand point? \n\nI'm open to hearing any advice or experiences with this sort of thing. Should I be concerned or am I overthinking it?",

        "content": "To start with, we got our 12 year old a basic phone (limited apps, no internet, etc) for the sole purpose of texting with friends and to use to contact us when needed. We told them we would be monitoring usage and that we could see texts. They are incredibly extroverted, and not as involved with extracurriculars (by choice) as their friends are, so they don't get to have as many hang outs as they'd like, and we were hoping that being able to text with friends would be helpful for their mental health and social life. \n\nThey are in private school, one with high standards for the students behavior, and we thought that would weed out some of the \"bad influences\" and such, but we have been concerned by the kids our child has started communicating with the most. They are the less involved in sports and music and such students also, but seem to spend a lot of their time on tiktok and other media. Our child does sports but needs rest time and enjoys reading, playing outside, and Minecraft and is not allowed on tiktok and has limited YouTube. \n\nThe friends seem sex obsessed, though most of it is not directed at any one person, more of just general comments or jokes. They're also very, very rude to others, lots of name calling, shaming, etc. And so, so many cuss words. \n\nAt what age do you just accept this is normal? I guess I was thinking 14+, not at 12. \n\nI want to sit down with them and tell them they cannot communicate with these friends anymore via text, but I'm worried that's overcontrolling and won't get the results I'm hoping for. I just want to keep their standards higher than this... They've always been a popular kid, but the other popular, more mature and respectful students are always busy and don't have much time for hanging out and texting it seems.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "I probably wouldn't ban them from talking to their friends, these are people they like and care about, not just some toys they play with.

I also don't think it's really feasible to enforce, since there's so many other ways they could contact each other that you'd have no way of monitoring.\u00a0\n\n\nThe sexual content and swearing aren't really a problem at all, but I do worry about the name-calling and shaming - is this bullying behavior? Is it encouraging an unhealthy body image, low self-esteem, issues like that? If so, I'd sit them down for a discussion about those issues specifically. The approach to that discussion would depend on whether you're more worried about your child being hurt or hurting others.\n\n\nIf you're worried about them being hurt, I would absolutely avoid any punitive response whatsoever, and outright say \"I'm not angry, I'm concerned\". I'd talk about what concerns you about their discussion specifically and encourage them to talk about how they're feeling, and explore whether this is something they need professional help dealing with.\n\n\nIf you're worried about them hurting others, I would talk about why this behavior is hurtful. If they seem to understand and feel sorry for their actions, I'd leave it at that and monitor whether their behavior changes in the future. If they double down, or if your initial discussion doesn't change the behavior, then I'd be looking into punitive actions like taking away their phone or grounding them.",

If I'm honest, this is a question I think about quite a bit because when I was fifteen, I was at my cousin's thirteenth birthday party at a bowling alley and she got her first period.

I had already done Sex Ed and since it's a co-ed school, we learned the basics together so I knew what it was but I didn't know enough to fully explain it other than, it's normal and it means your body is changing. There was a shop over the road that was a clothes shop and supermarket in one so I ran over to get a pair of tracksuit bottoms, wet wipes and a plastic bag for the clothes she had on. She got changed while I told her friends who had noticed her prolonged absence that she had an issue, had to change her clothes and asked them not to mention it and when my cousin came back the party continued as normal and she told her mother that night about everything. \n\nAs I've been watching my daughter grow, it's something I've thought about time and again. My SIL could teach her in an ideal world but she and my brother live abroad and we mainly talk through Skype and this, to me at least, feels a bit too personal for a Skype call so I've been debating researching it and educating myself so when the time comes, I can help her better than with my cousin because I kept myself looking calm to keep her calm but internally, I was a bit panicked mainly because I didn't understand it.\n\nWhat is everyone's opinions on this and any input would be appreciated.",

        "content": "To begin, this will be long. It will have lots of information. And I am looking for serious advice and hopefully, encouragement that my daughter is NOT an alien from another planet (I kid. I seriously love her and want the best, which is why I am reaching out to the Reddit universe).\n\nBackground: My daughter is an only child. We are a spiritual/religious household that is focused on keeping the love of Christ as the center, not rigorous rules. I was home with her for the first 4 years of her life before getting a part-time job. This is her first year in Kindergarten at our local public school. She attended preschool for one year and loved it. She has some medical history including three surgeries for her feet. She was born in 2019, which means that for half of her first year, we were in lockdown. I did a more Montessori-based setup for her starting as an infant.\n\nHer temperament: She is outgoing with her friends and extremely sociable. She is shy and timid with anything new. Until this point, she did well with the boundaries we set in the home. She speaks extremely well with a large vocabulary (I accredit this to our love of books and our regular conversations during the day). There are days I question if I got her birthday correct and she is not a 9 or 10-year-old. Everything else is a typical five-year-old girl.\n\nThe change: Once she turned five ... things have been interesting in the house. This is my first and only child, so these might be all normal. All of a sudden we are seeing these behaviors that are not changing no matter our tactics:\n\nShe sneaks food in the home... even though we are constantly feeding her! It seems like every time I turn around she is either asking for food or sneaking food (She is in the 90th percentile overall and that has been consistent since birth. No big weight change). We try to not keep prepackaged snacks since those get devoured immediately (but, we are also two extremely busy parents. So, we can't be perfect).\n\nShe has been getting into EVERY THING! Before, she knew 100% that my desk was off limits. She wouldn't dare play with anything because she knew there were consequences. When she was a toddler it would be a pop on the hand and re-focusing on HER toys. I would catch her looking at things or acting sneaky and she would get reprimanded, but nothing crazy. Lately, anything and everything she feels she can play with or touch. I have a couple of hobbies and not a lot of storage space in the home to lock everything up. Today she poured out a whole bottle of nail polish and cut up some of my fabric WITH my good sewing scissors. She also got into various drawers and stole little things.\n\nWe find random things she has impulsively gotten into. She squeezed out a whole toothpaste. She squeezed out my husband's face cream for his eczema. She licks random things... including the wheel of our car!\n\nI know behavior-wise she is supposed to test boundaries. We see this in the constant arguing back and defiance. Those I saw coming... everything else I didn't. She just recently stopped pooping her pants every day. But still, there are accidents at least twice a week.\n\nAt school, she is an angel. Everyone loves her and she seems to have good behavior in the classroom (at least nothing bad enough for her teacher to talk to us about). She seems to make good choices at school but then doesn't control herself at the house. I wish we had a backyard for her to independently play in, but we don't have a fence and I don't feel safe with her back there alone. I am in college and part of my job is on the computer. My husband works from home on the computer too. I can recognize that we seem unavailable to her, but we try our hardest to connect every day. Thursdays are our \"family night.\" Every Sunday we go to church together as a family. On Saturdays we try to all get outside for a walk or bike. I am doing everything I know how to... I know there is always room for improvement.\n\nDiscipline: The things I have tried: Spanking. Whether you agree or not, I have spanked her a few times in her life. I didn't at all when she was a baby or toddler (other than a pop on the hand). But since this change in her, I have explained that she is getting a spanking and then after I try to repair the relationship while explaining why I did so. When I yell (I try my hardest not to), I make sure to apologize and tell her that I made a wrong choice by yelling. We do a reward system where she earns little pom-poms for good choices and when she gets to 10 she can choose something like a small toy or treat. We have recently started taking AWAY the pom-poms for really poor choices. We have grounded her from any and all screens for a day or two (depending on her attitude). She doesn't watch TV all the time, but at least once a day she will watch a Disney movie or show. She has had toys put away (Which she seems to forget about and move onto the next thing to play with).\n\nSo there you have it. It's not every little thing. Please note that something like this occurs every. single. day. She doesn't know WHY ( or can't explain why ) she makes these choices. I am afraid one day she will make a choice that physically hurts her. Or ruins something important. I hope my love and care for her comes across. I want to do the best I CAN do as her mother. She is an amazing little girl. She is super sensitive and at times she breaks down and says \"Something is wrong with me!\" I don't want her to feel that way, but I also want her to learn self control. Maybe this is ALL normal for this age group.\n\nAt the end of the day, here is my focus and concern. Did I show her the love and mercy of Jesus? Where can I approve for the next day? What am I not understanding that could help my family find some peace in this mess? So, if you have anything for me to try, I will try. Thank you for coming to my rant. Thank you for reading!",

In June, his Mom and her boyfriend took the kids bowling. I received a call at 10:50 pm (curfew was 11:00 pm) from my daughter's phone. I answer, fully expecting her to tell me she's running late, which was often the case with his Mom returning my daughter home. \n\nInstead, the Mom's boyfriend greeted me and began rambling for the next 10 minutes about how he understands how protective I am since he's a father, and goes on to explain they've devised a plan for my child to stay the night and either sleep on the couch or their bed wherever I'm comfortable with. \n\nHe goes on to explain they've discussed that my daughter is not on birth control and he will be very protective of her and make sure that nothing happens under his watch. Throughout all of this he is repeating himself and slurring his words. \n\nI asked him if he has been drinking. He answers no. I proceed to tell him that my child will not be sleeping over and that I'm on the way to come pick her up. \n\nWhen I arrive, there are beer cans strewn about the driveway The driver side door to the mom's boyfriend's car is open and the engine is idling. The scene looks chaotic. \n\nAs I'm approaching the door, I hear the mom's boyfriend in a rushed voice say, \"Shhhh here she comes!\" I enter, and immediately take notice of my daughter's boyfriend sobbing, and my first thought is to diffuse the situation. \n\nI ask my daughter's boyfriend if he is okay and he states that he is. Both the mom and her boyfriend look very uncomfortable and nervous. I leave abruptly as I just want to get my daughter out of this very uncomfortable situation. \n\nI find out that night and in the days that followed, that they had both gotten consumed alcohol at the bowling alley and drove the kids back to their place. My daughter's boyfriend was upset about that, and he was also upset the mom's boyfriend gave his little brother (12) a birthday spanking in the middle of the bowling alley causing extreme embarrassment. \n\nI have since, refused to allow my daughter around the mom or the boyfriend. The mom didn't reach out to me until August begging for a \"second chance\", which she has continued to do since then. \n\nMy issue is, she does not seem to grasp how serious the nature of the situation is. She has guilt-tripped me stating that she's \"missing time with the kids\" and I am \"being unreasonable.\" She has repeatedly minimized their actions as \"a mistake\", whereas I've pointed out that night was a series of very poor decisions that endangered all three children. And most recently, she is stating that I am being unreasonable and she is growing tired of respecting my boundaries and playing nice. \n\nI've stood firm throughout all of this, but she has minimized this so much so that I worry the children are both now looking at me as a villain as it has limited their time to the weekends/holidays he spends with his father.\n\nWhat is the consensus? Am I being unreasonable?",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "to be fair his son seems to be more reasonable than her,  not sure what to expect about the mother but maybe you should look forward building trust with your daughters boyfriend (unsure of your current relationship with him) as he seems to be more of an adult than his mother, and maybe your family can be a positive influence for him or even some support. Talk to them as adults (but keep in mind they are young adults) to let them understand what were your thoughts on what happened, but based on how you describe it feels they might be more ashamed of the mothers way of acting than thinking you're the villain.\n\nI don't think you're being unreasonable and probably the mother is putting in on you so she doesn't need to reflect on her being irresponsible.",

        "title": "At my witts end with 7 month old not sleeping",
        "content": "So, my 7 month old is a very sweet and easy going baby. However his big thing since birth is that he just will not sleep. He has a pretty bad case of reflux and the pediatrician is saying he likely has some structural nasal/throat issues that he may or may not grow out of. So basically, if he is laying flat on his back, he can NOT sleep. \n\nHe throws up pretty much every time he is flat.\nThe spitup has gotten better, we were soaking bath towels with spit every feed and we have gradually moved to normal burp rags. He is a healthy weight. But he just can't be flat. We've tried inclining the bed, but unless he is at an insane 45 degree angle or steeper, he just pukes. Over and over until awake and hungry. \n\nTo add to this, he is so much more difficult when sick. And seeing how he is in daycare that's like half the time. Anytime he is sick he is just so impacted by mucus and ends up coughing. Dr isn't concerned because he has good oxygen readings/clear lungs during the worst of it and thinks he could still grow out of it. One of those \"there's not much to do at this age unless it gets worse, tough it out\" sorts of things.\n\nBut goddamn if it isn't misery. I haven't been able to properly sleep train him due to these issues so he just sleeps on my chest. I have to lay in bed like I'm in a propped up coffin. And when it's really bad I just have to sit awake all damn night in the recliner while he squirms in his sleep and try not to drop him because I'm absolutely exhausted. \n\nAnd my stupid mother in law is always telling me about all the little things with it I'm doing wrong. \"You should have him sleeping in a crib by now, youre running out of time to do that you know\" like shut up. I KNOW. I have tried so many times to get him to sleep in a crib and he won't. I've tried inclines, pillows to boost it up, all the little things to do for congestion and all the gimmicky products that are supposed to fix this crap. Rice cereal thickener. Saline sprits. All kinds of aspirators. We practically live in the bathroom with the hot water running. We even moved out of a house that had a mold problem and that still hasn't helped it.\n\nI'm so exhausted. And we are expecting another baby I don't particularly want right now. Despite being careful and on birth control, here we are. So I'm running out of time and so sick of being exhausted and I just think of the next year of my life and absolutely hate the thought of it. I guess I'm being selfish. But I dunno. I'm so tired of being so tired. Im always so frustrated with everyone and have no patience or time for anything. It's like his whole life has been one long newborn phase for me. And I get to do it all over again!\n\nThis shit is so hard and I'm sick of having to sit up every night and be absolutely exhausted every day at my full time job and come home and do it again. My husband helps with things ok during the day, but he sleeps too deeply to be a safe option with the baby overnight. \n\nI am so freaking angry at my life right now. I just want to fucking sleep. I don't want to have to deal with this crap and then with another baby so soon. Just so damn tired.",

        "title": "trans adult - need thoughts",
        "content": "OK.... throwaway account and wall of text here.\n\nMy adult son (almost 23) told me yesterday that he realized that he has body dysphoria and gender dysphoria.  He says that he thinks that he is trans and wants to go on HRT so that he can be more feminine.  I am pro-LGBTQIA+ and I do want to be supportive, so I want to put that out there before the wall of text that follows.  But I'm also not very familiar with a lot of this, certainly no expert on gender identity or the like.  When I ask for more information, he says that he doesn't want to fully transition and doesn't necessarily want to grow breasts and he doesn't want to identify as a woman but that he describes himself as non-binary transfeminine.  To me this seems that he just wants to be more feminine?  Which is actually kind of funny to me, because he's not super masculine to begin with, but I understand that's besides the point.\n\nAll that being said, I have a lot of reservations.\n\n* He has unresolved trauma from his childhood.  Briefly: when he was about 6, his father met a woman who was cult-like.  She was into the evangelist Christian \"quiverfull\" belief of having large families and anti-birth control.  Before they had their first child (they had 3 total before splitting, although only 1 that he ever met), she became obsessed with my son - brainwashing him, forcing him to call her mom, trying to convince him that I was bad by saying things like that I had an abortion and killed his sibling (had not had an abortion ever, or been pregnant more than once at the time), calling CPS on me constantly.  Although I knew that it was getting worse and had strong suspicions of abuse, my attorney advised me to go through the motions since we had no proof, and to only go through the courts due to how volatile the situation was.  My son was brainwashed and threatened to the point where he would not say anything, but he did act completely normal when he was home with me.  It was eventually found that not only were they abusing him physically, they were locking him in his room with the door handle reversed, with nothing in there except a mattress; they insisted he had demons.  She was beating him, his father probably was as well and would hold him under the shower to \"wash the demons away.\"  There is a lot more but that's the jist of some of it.  Turns out they were both on heroin.\n* He was diagnosed with PTSD from the abuse and was in therapy for several years.  This all happened in the span of a year - by the time he was 7, his father lost all custody and visitation and he never saw him again.  He came out of it pretty well - at least he was a happy kid; you would never have suspected his traumatic childhood.  I did put him in therapy several more times over the years for various reasons but would stop at his prompting.  When he was 15 or 16, he went to a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with ADHD.  They gave a couple of options and suggestions for medication; ritalin was one, and the others were not as addictive or capable of being abused.  The thing is, he has a highly addictive personality and so I requested that we try something non-addictive first, since I had heard him mention his friends having ritalin and it sort of gave me the ick factor like he was trying to get it for other reasons - to be cool, sell it, whatever.  He was on the other medication (I can't recall what it was) only briefly; I can't remember why he wanted to stop, but basically he stopped the medication and quit going to his regular appointments on his own not longer after.  He also pooh-poohed their suggestions of other ways to work on himself, such as cutting back on weed, working on a regular sleep schedule, the importance of healthy eating, etc.\n* He does have self-esteem issues and has for some time, probably at least in part related to the above (childhood trauma).  And also probably in part due to untreated ADHD, he's also highly unmotivated, compulsive, and while he's very smart and has lots of interests, he can't seem to stick to anything longterm and he's constantly flipflopping while looking to find the mold that he fits in.  Maybe it's because of gender/body dysphoria.  Maybe HRT would help.  What if it doesn't?  Is it fair to ask him to explore therapy and his childhood traumas, ADHD treatment, and hold off on HRT for now?  I feel like I want him to slow down a little bit.  I know that sexuality and gender are different, but he's been back and forth on being bisexual, gay, and straight; just two weeks ago he randomly mentioned preferring women again and wanting to have kids someday (to which I replied that gay couples can have kids too).  Just to highlight his sort of back and forth / noncommital behavior.  I honestly do not see him committing to this.  I guess there's no harm in exploring?  Not physically, but what about mentally in an already-fragile individual?\n* I have spent many years and a lot energy trying to help him find his place in life.  I feel like when I give 100% effort, he gives 50%.... or less.  I am afraid that I'm already exhausted from this, and now there is more piling on.  So, I have tried to take a step back to give him independence (more on that below), hoping that it would help him find his way if I wasn't right there all the time.  How much am I supposed to give, or how involved am I supposed to even be?  Is it fair to say, \"I'm here for you for emotional support, but you need to figure this out on your own\" whether that be financially like copays or things like getting to appointments.  I love him, but I have my own life to live as well.  His inability to stick to anything and seemingly his expectation of me putting in more effort than him makes me question if this is a good idea or not.  I do feel like he's searching for the magic answer, although I'm not sure how magical this is since it is complicated, but that then brings me back to him being a very low-effort individual who is looking for an \"easy button\" that he thinks will solve all of his problems.\n* He does not have a job, and has never had a job.  He does not drive.  He is fully dependent on me (and now food stamps) for his living expenses.  In 2020 (he was 19), we moved about 30 minutes away from where he spent most of his tween/teen years.  I always felt that he was unhappy with this; he wasn't in school or anything, but his friend group was there and it did isolate him from them since he does not drive (although he can take public transit as we live in the San Francisco Bay Area where it is abundant).  Him not having a job (or being in school) and also not being the most helpful around the house / our clashing personalities had been a consistent problem.  He wouldn't follow pretty basic rules (i.e., not smoking weed in the house, not bringing strangers over without asking (I have a younger daughter now as well, so it is a safety issue), keeping his room somewhat clean at least from trash and food items, etc., bringing dishes out, cleaning up his own messes).  Last year, I asked him how he'd feel about moving back to that area on his own, if I paid for his apartment.  The deal was that I would pay his rent ($1850) but that he would need to find employment and pay for food, and his utilities (except cellphone and internet).  Basically he would need to make a minimum of about $1000/month to cover food and \\~$240 for utilities.  Not particularly difficult in an area with a $16/hr minimum wage; he could get there working 20 or so hours a week.  Fast forward a year; no job, I'm paying the utilities because he can get evicted if I don't; told him I would not buy him food, suggested he apply for food stamps and he did.\n* Another, less problematic fear is that he's looking to get on HRT and otherwise change himself (presumably with clothing and whatnot), but he can't pay for it, and I'm already pretty strapped given that we live in a HCOL area and I'm paying over $2300 a month in living expenses for him as his rent is going up to $2025 with his lease ending.  Right now he's on my insurance, which is excellent, but what happens when he turns 26?  It's possible that HRT is free or that he can find it elsewhere since we live in California.\n\nWould love any nonjudgmental thoughts if you've made it this far.",

        "content": "Ok so I need to vent. And also help. \n\nMy mom has always been like THE MOM. She stayed home with us, was a massive support in early adult life and had just always been there for anything. Fast forward to about 4 years ago, my parents financial situation changed and my mom had to get a job outside of the house. \n\nIt was a huge eye opener to me how much I relied on her for just being with me. I got pregnant in 2022, had my first child, she was there and I\u2019m so glad she was, I almost died, my daughter almost died. It was incredibly traumatic and I NEEDED a lot of emotional and physical support. \n\nI\u2019m 37 weeks pregnant now with our second child, and have to have a c section. I am terrified. I\u2019m terrified about going into spontaneous labor (because of last time). It has been the plan the entire pregnancy for my mom to come stay at the house with my toddler for the 5 days that my dr wants me in the hospital the entire pregnancy. \n\nLast week at my OBGYN appointment I had started dilating and was 50% effaced, so with my anxiety already sky high I\u2019ve been panicking that I\u2019m not going to make it to my scheduled date. \n\nOut of nowhere both my parents started saying that I needed to use my aunt for childcare instead of my mom. My aunt (while I love her dearly) is not well equipped for that. Her home is not safe (she is a hoarder and has less than trustworthy people that are in and out of her home) my parents didn\u2019t allow her to watch us as kids.\n\nI\u2019m obviously not comfortable with that. \n\n\nThis weekend my grandma had a stroke and emotions are absolutely high. My dad ended up yelling at me and calling me selfish and demanded I use my aunt for childcare instead of my mom. \n\nThings got really heated and I am struggling. I called my mom (who was with my grandma) and flat out asked if it was still her plan to watch my daughter and she told me she was too uncomfortable asking for time off work. \n\nI\u2019m holding a lot of resentment for my dad for putting her in a place financially where her minimum wage job can literally break the bank. I\u2019m resentful. \n\nMy husbands family is out of state and I myself am a workaholic that doesn\u2019t have friends because I work 70-80 hours a week. All my friends are coworkers\u2026 who will be covering my job when I go into labor so I can\u2019t really ask them to take my toddler. \n\nI\u2019m SO MAD that they committed to doing this until 3 weeks before I\u2019m due and then not only tried to force their own decision of a \u201cback up\u201d onto me.. but would suggest someone that they didn\u2019t deem as safe for their own kids. \n\nI am feeling like the only choice I have now is to be alone and have my husband miss the birth of our child. And I\u2019m scared and mad and incredibly sad and feel betrayed. \n\nThe worst part is ALL of my anger is geared towards my father. Like thinking about him is going to set me into a rage and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s healthy or normal. The man has worked his entire life to provide a really good life for my family and just wanted to start his own company. He deserved to do that. It just happened right before Covid and has been an endless struggle since. \n\nSo\u2026 summary - incredibly traumatized by my last delivery, already strained relationship with my own family, no support from husbands, childcare fell through, losing my grandma, and feeling like I\u2019ve lost all control in this situation.. I\u2019m lost and don\u2019t know what to do or where to go. There isn\u2019t even enough time to properly interview, introduce, get to know a paid option\u2026 let alone save for 5 days of 24/7 childcare for a 2 year old that has NEVER been in a room without one of both of her parents. \n\nI need options. And be gentle because I\u2019m emotional. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI think I\u2019m done responding to comments. \n\nI am doing what I know how to do to emotionally process a situation and that\u2019s be completely honestly about my emotions (justified or not) \n\nI was looking for advice about hiring a sitter or doula, experiences people had with that, if they decided to go it alone without their spouse and everyone seems to be incredibly focused on the fact I\u2019m incredibly emotional. \n\nI\u2019m 37 weeks pregnant. I\u2019m high risk, my last delivery quite literally almost killed me. Of course I\u2019m emotional. \nMy grandma is dying right before I have a baby..

        "content": "I'm not really sure what I'm looking for with this post, other than maybe other parents to hear from as I am really struggling with this. My daughter is barely 13 and I got a call from her school counselor last week that she disclosed to her she had been sexually active with her boyfriend who is a 14 year old (my daughter was aware the school counselor called me). I knew she had a \"boyfriend\" but I was kind of shocked and dumbfounded as I thought I was monitoring things as best I could., I guess I just didn't think it would happen so soon and so young. I became sexually active when I was around 15 and am thankful my mother immediately got me on BC (the depo shot) to avoid any teen pregnancy catastrophes so I've always known I would do the same for my daughter, I am just struggling with how young she is. I made it known to her that this did not mean I condoned it and that she was still too young to be engaging in that type of activity but that if she was going to be doing it, and in the event she makes that choice I wanted to make sure she was protected from pregnancy. I also tried talking to her about STD's and how BC doesn't protect against those but she got the typical teenage attitude with me and said she already knows all about it. I would feel much better about this if she were 15 or 16 but I know I can talk to her about it until I'm blue in the face and with teens where there's a will there is a way. I don't even know where this happened because she wouldn't tell me, but she did say they've only done it once. I am not a helicopter mom but feel like I keep pretty good tabs on her. Although, I do feel somewhat like a failure because I think that age is just way too young and I'm wondering why. The school counselor told me it's really not that uncommon, but I still don't think it's ok. I just felt like I needed to get her some protection immediately as a 13 year old pregnancy would be unbelievably devastating. I chose the implant because of the high effective rate, don't have to remember to take a pill every day and risk anything, and it's good for 5 years. I should also add my daughter is already in therapy for depression and anxiety as she started having a bunch of issues in middle school last year socially (fighting/crying/bullying with other girls and friends at school), poor attendance, poor grades, etc. I told her she should really talk to her therapist about being sexually active. I'm just really struggling with this and I will admit I'm not the greatest communicator. Wondering what else I should/could be doing.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "I think you did the right thing to get her an implant. You also did the right thing to talk to her about protection and STDs, even though you got the teen eye roll about it.\n\nThe only other thing I would do is talk to your daughter about the emotional elements of sex. That sex is something two people do together (she's not giving it up or having it done to her) and that it should be pleasurable. Make sure she knows about enthusiastic consent, and that her partners should like, respect, and trust her and that she should feel the same way about them. That she'll discover stuff she likes and doesn't like, and that she shouldn't put up with a partner who pushes her boundaries.\n\nI would also be pretty upset if my kiddo started having sex at 13 for all the reasons you say, but I think ultimately that you're right that it's her choice to make and that she'll find a way. So I would focus on making sure she feels comfortable going to you with questions or worries, and that she has the confidence to choose good partners and to advocate for herself when necessary.",

        "content": "We currently have an 8-month-old, my first, and my MIL's first grandbaby (my mother's sixth). Several months ago while eating dinner at their house she politely demanded to care for our baby once a week. A little taken back but wanting to encourage a loving relationship between grandma and baby, I acquiesced. So she has been taking care of the baby on Fridays, the only weekday she doesn't go to daycare. This arrangement has been fine, however, my MIL is much more controlling than my mother and I am sensitive to her comments about our parenting style, which she mentions when I come pick up the baby. People are constantly commenting about how our baby is content and calm and so easy. Yet the only thing I hear from her is what we *should* be doing. \n\nShe offered to go bed shopping with me as our baby has outgrown her crib and I told her at least five times that we are using a mattress on the floor that we had ready to go. Due to that, she called the baby a \"wild child\" and said \"be careful what you wish for.\" She has told me in the past that she *needs* to be helpful, and I know that is emotional immaturity on her part. She *needs* to buy baby clothes because she wants to help. In response, I told her point blank that I want to provide for my daughter. That seems so unnecessary to say. She can buy fun stuff but we can provide her with day to day clothes. Back before I had the baby I told her (pretty sure I did!) that I wanted to have two weeks to ourselves to settle in after she was born. We had meals prepped, etc. MIL was at our house that very same day home from the hospital. I was trying to latch the baby and she said the baby didn't want to eat, even though it had been five hours since the last feeding. I ended up leaving the baby with my husband and grandma, exhausted, while he explained she did need to eat and fed a bottle. \n\nI feel a sense of competition with my MIL about caring for the baby, like I need to explicitly make clear that she is mine and my husbands and we make the rules. Before we had the baby we took a birth course and the same company had a program for grandparents. I mentioned it to her because we enjoyed our course so much, and then apparently she told her friends that I had forced her to do it. \n\nI have spoken to a counselor about setting boundaries in this relationship and was suggested to ask her what having a grandchild means to her. Have not done this yet. I want to have a loving relationship with my MIL so I'd prefer to have a conversation, but I just don't know where to start. I am 40-years-old so I am somewhat astonished I need to remind her that I am a competent adult--but perhaps that is not even relevant in her mind. It definitely feels like a trust issue. I mean, I've run a business, had a successful first career and am almost finished with a law degree. I just want to enjoy my baby with my husband and finish my degree but I find myself ruminating.",

We currently have a toddler who\u2019s going through a tough time (tantrum-wise) and we are steadily trying to work together to get our careers set up. It feels like everywhere I go friends my age are having babies (their second or third now!) so I feel this want to have another as well, because I also genuinely want that and want to experience it one last time. We tried for a year with no luck and stopped because it was emotionally draining.

        "title": "Some statistics to reassure the parents who are understandably freaking out right now",
        "content": "Okay, so there have been multiple posts about school shootings today and parents are rightfully very concerned about the safety of their children. My day job involves, among other things, analysing data and putting context to it. So, here goes my attempt at doing that with the data around adolescent fatalities.\n\nThe total rate of adolescent fatalities in the United States for the 5 most recent years of data is less than 60 per 100,000. So, keep in mind, every year that your child is between 12 and 17 years old, there is a 0.06% chance that they will die. That is 1 in 1,667. Your child is almost three times as likely to have been born with an extra finger (somewhere between 1 in 500 and 1 in 1,000). Other things more likely include having a cat live to over 21 years old, giving birth to identical triplets, being born with a third nipple, or getting a perfect score on the SAT.\n\nSo, unless you live in a particularly dangerous neighborhood or have a particularly dangerous lifestyle (if you go on family vacations to SCUBA in unexplored caves, this might not apply to you), you can sleep well at night knowing that you probably are never going to face your absolute worst case scenario.\n\nBreaking things down into more granular levels. The most likely cause of death is accidental injury, which makes up more than 1/3 of all adolescent deaths (22 in 100,000 probability). Homicides and suicides combined are only slightly higher than accidental injury (13 and 10 in 100,000 respectively).\n\nSo, go ahead and play some golf, you'll have a 1 in 5,000 chance of getting a hole in one as an ameuture, be careful though, if you are playing in Florida, you have a 1 in 7,500 chance of getting struck by lightning, and while you are at it, try out to be an extra in a TV show (1 in 7,500 Americans will be a TV extra at some point in their life).\n\nAnd, if you want to put your anxiety about things that can go wrong for your child, become active in your community's Safe Streets to Schools program. Seriously, being hit by a car while walking represented over 1/4 of all accidental injuries leading to death and also represents a huge portion of injuries leading to permanent disability. Added bonus, it will make things like family walks and bike rides safer even when your kids aren't walking to and from school, which walking and biking as a family is a great way to get exercise and bond with your children at the same time. You'll discover so many things about your community that you never notice while just driving through.\n\n  \nEdit- wow, a lot of people are missing the point of this. It isn't to downplay the severity of the problem, it isn't to downplay the trauma of the people who have been involved in it, one kid dead is too many, until the number of children who die every year, of any cause, is zero, we'll have reason enough to fight to improve things. The point was that at some point, as a parent, you have to accept that bad things will sometimes happen, and that the all encompassing fear of those bad things happening specifically to you is probably not healthy given how unlikely you are to be the victim of one of those things. Simply thinking that something could happen to someone should be enough to motivate you, you shouldn't need to think it is going to happen to you to motivate you to fix it.\n\nOh, and if you were wondering why I specifically called out becoming active in your community's Safe Streets to Schools program, it's because its a program that I have first hand experience in pushing through change. In the last two years that I've been involved, we've been able to push our city from having an engineering department whose response to requests for pedestrian and cycling safety improvements was literally, fuck those kids, high speed traffic go vroom (I wish I was making that up, but there was actually a city council meeting, where the city engineer, with a perfectly straight face, said that she could not recommend approval of the safety improvements that residents were asking for because it would be too inconvenient for drivers... drivers that her department never even bothered to determine whether or not they were people living in, working in, or at least visiting that neighborhood, or people just driving through) to now having a comprehensive plan for safety improvements on every city and county maintained street within city limits as they come due for maintenance. If one kid killed in a school shooting is too many, then so is one kid killed while crossing the street on their way to school, and if the national gun control debate is too overwhelming for you, the safe streets movement is one that you can have an incredibly meaningful impact.",

        "content": "For some context, I gave birth in 2022. My daughter is now 2. As time has gone by my mom has shown me how irresponsible she can be as a grandparent and it's stressing me out. I've had this problem since my daughter started walking. When my mom couldn't quite control my toddlers movements as much anymore, she seemed to forget how fast toddlers are. This is her first grandchild so I gave her some grace. But time and time again she's shown me that I can't fully relax when I leave my daughter with her. I'll give some examples: \n\n- when I think my mom is watching her she'll randomly shout \"Where is she? Where's * toddlers name *!?\" Scares me everytime because she has a large pool that isn't fenced off in the front yard.\n- my daughter is almost always screaming when she's with my mom. Sometimes from excitement, sometimes just screaming from fighting about something. Yes she's at that age of \"I can do it myself\",  so most things are struggle. But with my mom in particular she's ALWAYS screaming or fighting, to bath, to eat, to get some type of treat, to play etc. \n- everytime I fetch my daughter from my mom's place she's really hyperactive and she always fights us when it's time to go home. This isn't a problem, except that my mom makes a sad face and makes me feel guilty for fetching my child. It also makes it seem like I am the bad person in the situation.\n- My mom struggles to say no to her, she always says some variation of \"should I call your mommy, your mommy said no you can't have this so you can't\". Again, makes me the bad guy in the situation. \n-  She is never fully present when I bring my daughter over. She's always on a phone call or texting. I've heard my daughter shout \"grandma grandma grandma! Listen!!\" Everytime I've brought her over, only to find my mom talking on the phone. It's almost never an emergency and is usually just gossip with a relative. \n- She knows what my toddler likes to do, she is the only grandkid, yet she makes no attempt at setting up anything my daughter would like. Eg, finger painting or colouring. After seeing my daughter getting bored I started showing up with stuff for her to do. \n\nI have addressed these things with her, I've spoken to someone who knows her well and is a grandma herself, and asked  her what I should do. She said that I should give her a chance because my mom wasn't grown up by her mom and therefore doesn't know how to be a grandma yet, but she will learn with time. I was told to just drop my daughter off for like an hour and give my mom the set of rules I have for her and then give her space to be a grandma. \n\n The thing is, I've done this before. I've even spoken to her about it. She gets all upset and says \"you act like I've never been a parent before\". The most recent time I spoke to her about the chronic cellphone use around my daughter and the inability to be firm with her when she needs to she said \"I get it! Your mother in law is just better at being a grandparent I'm horrible!\" I never mentioned my MIL once. So she gets all dramatic and upset. She makes those changes initially and then goes back to doing what she was doing. \n\nMy daughter loves my mom so so much I want them to have this special bond but I don't know how to initiate it while also trying to make my mom understand that toddlers need boundaries and routine!\n\nGrandparents of reddit, help me understand things from my mom's point of view. How do I approach her?\n\nTLDR: My mom is irresponsible as a grandparent so I haven't let her care for my daughter much. I feel guilty but don't know how to change it. Help.",

She's (younger daughter, now 19) ADD, anxiety and all that good stuff.\n\nShe's always been a challenge to keep tucked in and on the straight and narrow. A handful. Maybe about 4 or 5 yrs ago her interest in boys became obvious so in stead of say \"wait until you are married\" we said \"here are some birth control options\". She went with the pellet in the arm but she always complained of some effects, bit it was left in nontheless.\n\nUpon the pellet's expiration date, she went to the Dr, had it removed and went for the IUD. That went bad so it came out. We really wanted her to try another brand of pellet or a depo shot but she insisted it is her body so her choice.\n\nEarlier this year she finally stared on the pill, whenever she could remember. I tried explaining to her that this is how so many women end up with and unexpected pregnancy. This is about the time she just went full-on rebel also. Ultimately her mother and I asked her to leave.\n\nShe moved in with a boyfriend. Suddenly in July she asked if we could attend her wedding at the courthouse the following week.\n\nHer mom and I had a good idea of what this meant but the daughter denied it.\n\nShe was working for an apartment complex as a front desk/customer service rep. She also lived at the same apartment she worked.\n\nShe was wanting to move into another apartment and gave her 30 day notice to leave the apartment as a resident where she worked before she knew whether she had another place.\n\nI get a call from my wife one night while I'm at work. Wife says daughter and her new husband don't have a place to live. She (and her new husband) want to move in with us. Oh, and she's pregnant.\n\nI'm like \"Hell no!\" But wife relented and said just for a month or so. She agreed that she didnt want the daughter and her growing family there long term at all.\n\nI finally agreed that as a short transitional period, to help them get on their feet was less rigid and more compassionate. I was told to talk to the daughter and let her know my terms/expectations.\n\nI did, and a couple of days later I am helping them move into my house and I find out from the daughter that she had lost her job.\n\nOh. That makes sense why she couldn't extend her stay at the current place. She's always had problems at school or work.

The pregnancy itself was low risk and healthy throughout and she was an overall very happy baby who slept through the night.\n\nWith this one, I had terrible morning sickness in my first trimester to the point where I had nearly no appetite, got diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes in the later stages of pregnancy (successfully diet-controlled), and had to fight tooth and nail about getting the birth experience I wanted (spontaneous, unmedicated, vaginal delivery)-which luckily I got with a healthy delivery of baby girl. Day two at the hospital, hubby and I gave in to supplementing with formula because baby was so fussy because she was hungry and hadn't had a single wet or dirty diaper that whole second day. \n\nCome home and my sinuses got so bad I couldn't breath at night to get any sleep, so I had to go to urgent care to get put on antibiotics for the sinus infection. Now I can breath, baby has been feeding mostly from the breast, but I think I might have just gotten thrush on my nipples after those antibiotics.

I felt bad not knowing and not helping with anything after finding out. I am a very shy person I have social anxiety, I have never been super close to his family. It actually got off to a rocky start because they couldn't understand my social anxiety. My ex never helped when he would ignore his family while walking in with me and not doing family stuff with them. He never helped to foster a relationship with them, with me. \n\nHe never told his family himself when either of our kidd was born. I had told his sister I was pregnant the first time and she called after I gave birth that day. With our son his family knew I was pregnant because he was living there. I started to get a bit closer to them I would be around them more and went to family events more there. But a family friend that dropped him off  had to tell them when our son was born  because he didn't inform them because he started to get mad at them for stuff. His family was upset with him about that. He would tell me he wanted to keep the kids away from his family and that they weren't his real family, him and his two sister are adopted his parents has no biological kids. \n\nHis family has never don't anything bad to our kids. In all actuality he aways said how he wanted kids, he couldn't wait. He lives kids but after having them he has little to no patience with them. He yells at them a lot over tiny stuff, tries to control everything the do, always wanting them to sit down, saying they move too much and when they don't sit still.he continues to yell until.he eventually gives up and let's me do take care of them with him leaving, or if he was watching them while at work he would ask my mom to come get them earlier than I got out because it was too much for him. At this time he has basically just been seeing the kids at the park I'll take them he'll play with them for a bit and that's it. Or he'll stop by and take them for a walk. He has started to say that I purposely keep the kidd away from him when I do not. At our sons last doctors appointments he tried to throw me under the bus saying I must have purposely not given permission for him to get text updates on appointments and went on a rent to the social worker and doctor that he doesn't see the kids that much and how it's my fault. \n\nI also have started talking to someone else. He does not know who the person is he keeps trying to figure it out but I know he would probably harass him. He keeps saying stuff like \"I know you have him living there with the kids\" when I do not. Me and this person do not live close about 50min away from each other so we don't see each other often. He thinks that the person is harming the kids but they are not. He's only seen the kids twice and I have never left them alone with him. \n\nSo on to the issue I am dealing with. Is the kids birthdays. For my sons birthday I just did cake with a few family members over in the afternoon. My kid dad came in the morning to see the kids. He wanted to stay all day and help set up but my mom doesn't want him around, oh yeah I forgot to mention I live with my parents. So he had left to go do something and then he ran into an issue with his bike and couldn't make it for the cake. My mom was happy because she didn't want him inside anyways. The whole time she was complaining about him when he wasn't there. She started saying how she doesn't want me to do anything for my daughters 2nd birthday because she doesn't want him around. I really wanted to do a nice party outside that's bluey themed. Unfortunately I don't have as much money as I needed so I am just gonna do a cake like I did for my sons. I bake and went to school for pastry and culinary so I will be making it myself. \n\nSo my kids dad wants to spend the whole day with the kids. we go to church and he wants to come to church with us and he wants to help me make the cake and help with the kids because for our sons birthday I did the cleaning myself and the cake and watched the kids because we'll he's not allowed in the house and because of how he acts with the kids. He said that I should have asked him for more help since it's his kids. But since no one wants him around and my church is a family church. I don't think it would go well. It would be very tense. Especially for my mom she would feel that she couldn't enjoy the service if he is there even if he is not near her. He knows a lot of my family does not like him anymore, it would be fine if he worked on changing his behavior but he has not. He's even more disrespectful and hurtful than ever before. Since I completely broke off from him he has been losing it more and more.  I am not sure how to go about tomorrow, if anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated.  I know this is a long read this doesn't even cover half of what I have been through with him. This would be easier if he was still connected to his family he could do his own thing with them for the kids birthdays but he is not. I am more connected to them now.  I told him he could do some one on one time with them instead of coming to the party but he refuses.",

He doesn't know how to get help and doesn't believe the options proposed would help him. I know one guy who was adopted and his life is a mess and I can tell there are some deep wounds stemming from it. I distrust some close family and I'm not adopted.\n\nMy own situation is different but it's similar enough. I feel awful continuously. She's moved on.

Makes me feel like I'll be made out to be a bad person for being cautious with my daughter innocence.\n\nSounds like he needs friends and a job.

I mean the excitement from day 1\u2026no words. She was born in May after COVID lockdowns happened so I was one of those moms that had to wear a mask at every appointment and go alone and after birth, no one could come over. \n\nBecause of this, her, myself and husband were as thick as thieves. She was a great sleeper and slept through the night at 3 months, always happy, no health issues, just this incredible miracle! I did go through horrible PPD and recovered from that around the time she was 7.5 months old and from there life was just incredible. \n\nThis went on for 3.5 years. \n\nMe and my husband would speak of possibly trying for a second but never decided because we just loved our family of 3. \n\n Then I found out July 4th last year I was expecting. I remember for the first few months I cried and cried because I was not ready to change our dynamic, share my time\u2026worried about how my 3 year old would handle it. Me and her have a very special bond. I always say we\u2019re so close because she knew how much I wanted to be her mommy. \n\nNow I have a 5.5 month old and 4 year old and wow. My 4 year old is incredible with her baby sister. No jealousy, so loving and adjusted well. \n\nI am not. I watch old shows I watched with her when she was little with my baby now and I find myself crying. I miss her so much. She\u2019s in VPK now and I find myself just wishing for one day of what my life used to be with just her. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I of course absolutely adore my second as well but I just feel like I can\u2019t get over this almost heartbreaking feeling of what life was before. \n\nI think I\u2019m dealing with PPD again and am on medication but some days I just am very unhappy with where life is right now and I look at my 5 month old and just hug and love on her because it\u2019s not like I wish she wasn\u2019t here. She\u2019s a blessing too! I\u2019m just having a hard time adjusting. A lot harder than I thought. \n\nAlso, where my first was already sleeping through the night, this one still has 1-2 wake ups and I\u2019m about to get a sleep consultant again so I can finally get some sleep. She also has reflux but under control and a lip tie. So she has problems my first never did and is all new to me. So it\u2019s a lot when I am sleep deprived, having a hard time adjusting, working 40+ hours a week with the 5 month old home with me full time\u2026and just missing the ease of what life was. \n\nAgain, my youngest is so cute, sweet\u2026I can\u2019t imagine life without her which is why I feel like what I\u2019m going through is so weird. \n\nI don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m posting this.

He doesn't want to go to therapy; says that he will never abandon his children. The implication here is very clear, he'd leave me but support the children.

        "title": "What should I do about my son (16M) having a bank account I didn't know about?",
        "content": "My son (16M), has always been a bit of a handful. He doesn't get into too much trouble, just a few things every now and again, nothing serious, but when I was moving his laundry over from the washing machine to the dryer while he was out of the house hanging out with friends, I found a Wells Fargo card in his name the bottom of the machine. This confused me - we don't bank with Wells Fargo. We (my wife and I) share a joint account at a major bank and a local credit union, and for my son's 15th birthday, we opened a shared account with my son at the credit union. This was just so that he had somewhere secure for his money, he doesn't have a job. There's never been any issues with that other than the occasional silly purchase, or him trying to buy something that his balance won't cover (by $1-2). There's no real reason for him to have a second account, with an institution we don't have a relationship with, with us having zero visibility into it. When he got home, I started questioning him about it, and he didn't really have many answers. When I asked him why he opened it, he said that it was on a whim, and that there was no real reason to do it, it was \"just in case\". (He has been diagnosed with ADHD and does have impulsivity issues.) I asked him how much money he put in, he said he only put in the minimum ($25). Then I inquired as to how he was able to open an account by himself at the ripe age of 16, and he told me that (again, on a whim), he decided he wanted one, got the information he'd need (a birth certificate and his Social Security card) out of our safe (which has unfortunately been kept unlocked recently due to the batteries dying and me not getting around to replacing them), without asking me or his mother, and went down to the branch near our house (telling us that he was \"going for a walk\" without specifying further). Apparently they let 16-year-olds open checking accounts on their own (i.e. without a parent co-signing), and he got the card out of the mailbox a few days later, before I checked it. I told him that I wasn't going to make him close it, as long as he made us co-signers and gave us visibility into his account, just like the credit union account. He bristled at this and said no. He said (ironically) that there was nothing to hide. I pretty much took offense at this and raised my voice, because until I saw that card and I asked him about it, it was all hidden from me and my wife. He responded in kind by claiming that I was being too controlling and couldn't I just let him have a little more freedom... I let him storm off to his room. Bringing it up to my wife later, I expressed my view that he face some punishment for going behind our backs, taking items out of our safe (in our bedroom), and using them to open a bank account which it seemed he was never going to tell us about. She believed that more discussion was required, but that it was a valuable lesson about how the real world works, and that we do need to lock the safe (I agreed on that one), and punishment may not necessarily be in order, but more transparency and trying to figure out why our son didn't feel comfortable communicating clearly with us (I agreed on that point as well). I just feel a little betrayed and that my trust has been broken, because he's been lying about his whereabouts, pretty much stealing out of the safe (even if he did return the items), and engaging in serious activities like opening bank accounts without our knowledge or consent. I told her my views on this and that I believe that if he does not grant us access to the account, that I should call Wells Fargo and attempt to have it closed, as I do not believe I should grant my son leeway to engage in activities behind my back like this. Now, a day later, we're pretty much at an impasse. My son's not really talking to us too much, just hanging out in his room most of the day. My wife and I still find it hard to come to a reasonable compromise, I do get that I should have locked the safe, I do bear some responsibility here, but he can't get away with this scot-free. We're just a little unsure how to proceed. Believe me, if I had any idea of my own, I wouldn't be consulting Reddit. Conversation will be playing a part, but the topic of punishment is still up in the air. Please submit any ideas you may have, perhaps some of you have gone through similar situations yourself.\n\n  \nTL;DR:\n\nMy 16-year-old son found a way to open a Wells Fargo account without telling us, using items from our (unfortunately due to an error of mine) unlocked safe. He impulsively opened the account \"just in case\" and didn\u2019t feel he needed our permission. When I confronted him, he resisted making us co-signers, claiming he had nothing to hide. I felt betrayed and believe he should face some consequences for his secrecy and lack of communication. My wife thinks more discussion is necessary, emphasizing transparency and the need to talk it out with him. We\u2019re stuck on how to proceed regarding punishment. Any advice would be appreciated.",

My issue is that his cooking style is completely different from mine. He cooks everything on high heat and the kitchen is always filled with smoke.

She wants to stop over almost every day and spend the whole day with her and choose the outfits she is wearing and will literally take out outfits I'm planning to have her in out of my hands to put her in something different. She came over when I was a week postpartum and rearranged her whole dresser so l could not find any of her clothes. She is overbearing with literally EVERYTHING and it's getting out of control. l've always had a problem sticking up for myself and putting my foot down so I've been trying to think of ways I can politely tell her that it's too much without ruining our relationship and causing drama in the family. I'm tired of feeling like a bad mom when I'm around her and like I'm competing with her for my daughter. Any advise will help, thanks.",

Our relationship has gone downhill since the birth of the child due to miscommunication, arguments, and resentment related to child care and other trivial things of living together.\u00a0 Please read my previous post if you have time.\u00a0 \n\nShe specifically mentions that I do not do enough research and planning for the future and it is straining her.\u00a0 There is truth to that as she is buying 10+ things on amazon every day for baby development and looking for houses every day to move out of her apartment.\u00a0 I always mention that I truly appreciate everything she does and will admit that I have stepped down because she is very controlling and a majority of the time I suggest houses or baby care it is turned down by her because she \u201cknows better\u201d and must be right.\u00a0 I have become so passive and cannot even speak up anymore because its always her way or the highway.\u00a0 She is complaining to me that I am not a leader and not a good husband/father because I do not plan for the future.\u00a0 Her personality is very driven and will get what she wants and anyone who tries to get in her way will suffer (me).\u00a0 \n\nWe got married last year, then got pregnant a month later, and now shes aggressively looking for a house even when I told her I am not ready financially yet.\u00a0 She saw a house that we both liked\u00a0 but its very competitive (Long island, NY)\u00a0 and to make a strong offer we had to pay all cash, close to 1 million.\u00a0 I was very uncomfortable putting all my life savings for a down payment and having to ask my parents for money.\u00a0 I was hoping we could talk this big decision out and maybe talk about my concerns but that seems to be the last thing she cares about.\u00a0 She kept pushing me to ask my parents for money because we had to make the offer soon.\u00a0 Ultimately I agreed and we gave the offer.\u00a0 The following day our offer was rejected by the seller and she got mad at me for not having any reaction or emotion.\u00a0 She then said \u201cdo you even care?!\u201d \u201cyou dont want to buy a house now?! To which i reacted very strongly; after all the uncomfortable conversations I had asking my family for money and agreeing to put my life savings in, she blames me again for not wanting to buy this house.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0I forgot to mention initially that my wife and her family are putting in about 40% on their end, roughly 400K and she also works and makes twice as much as me, hence why she is more comfortable taking this risk.  I didn\u2019t realize this is a very important factor. \n\nAt the heat of the argument she threatened divorce, I did not reply or speak for the rest of the day.\u00a0 That night, after we are calm and talking she started staying how we are not on the same page, Im not a leader etc. and that the baby would be better off growing up in a happy single family vs unhappy married.\u00a0 This happened two days ago and I am feeling very conflicted,\u00a0 I really dont want to walk away from this marriage and our child but I am also walking on eggshells every day and I afraid to get yelled at over the smallest things, because I also react verbally.\u00a0 I am seeing a therapist myself, she refused couples therapy.\u00a0 I just feel like anytime I disagree she will mention divorce; I dont know if I should still buy the house with her for the sake of our family and I dont know how the future looks like for us.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Wife threatens divorce after I am hesistant with paying all cash offer for a house (almost 1 million USD)",

He will kiss her on the head (I\u2019ve told everyone no kissing on face or lips at all because herpes), and I just get this ick feeling. I don\u2019t know why. I wasn\u2019t sexually abused by him, but he\u2019s said things to me in life that were wrong, like making fun of me when I started taking birth control at 18, or telling me I was getting chunky (when really I just finally became a healthy weight and wasn\u2019t malnourished anymore). This was all long long ago. He\u2019s almost 85 now. My kid is 2.

I can\u2019t reply to everyone but I really appreciate the validation and support I\u2019ve received.

She and I last lived together permanently (not just holidays and weekends) when she was a toddler, and before her mom and I split. If you read my prior post, she left college without telling anyone and was living with her then-boyfriend and mom before she put them both out of her home. My daughter then came to live with me in my studio before I upgraded my unit.  She refused to get back on birth control despite the risks as well. Her boyfriend, who was not working or doing anything worthwhile, moved in with his grandparents. She eventually broke up with him which honestly was a relief. She ended up meeting another guy a few weeks later, who we found out later was thirty years old. As expected, she does get pregnant but by this 30 year old(approximately six weeks after meeting him). She decided to end the pregnancy at home and on the day of her appointment she was supposed to take the depo shot. The 30 year old guy paid for the termination of the pregnancy and I provided the cost of the birth control. Afterwards, I find out that she actually did not use the money for the shot, but stated she scheduled herself to get an IUD on next week. She said she is using a sliding scale to get it for a much lower cost. When she first met this new guy, she stayed out all night without telling me. I have a rule that she does not have to come home, but has to shoot me a text and let me know. Since then, it has happened three or four more times. I feel like my excitement over her moving in has been overshadowed by stress, and I know that is a part of parenting a young adult. I feel like I have aged ten years over the past few months since she moved in honestly. There has also been quite a bit of drama due to things that she goes back to tell her mom and grandmother which adds to the stress. I am not sure what to do at this point. I only signed a six month lease which ends in November of this year. She has spoken about wanting to move out on her own soon, after originally saying she wanted us to stay together a few years. On a good note, she does work full time and is a hard worker. I'm not sure how to handle the impulsiveness at this point.",

My mom is and has been obsessed with my daughter since birth and almost completely ignores the fact that she has two other grandkids.\n\n For a little context, a few years ago after my divorce (was married for 8 years), I moved my kids to a new city about 45 mins away for work and we had a nice little rental house in the suburbs. My mom told me my daughter wasn\u2019t adjusting to school and offered to let her come stay with her then found a loophole to get custody by saying I would need to sign over custody temporarily so she could register for school there. I guess I was an idiot and fell for it. A couple months later I met my now husband and my mom used that as an excuse and decided to not give my daughter back even after I asked for her to come home. (Probably doesn't help that he is black and my mom is a closeted racist boomer). She also had my brothers run a background check on him which is coincidental bc she never did that with any of my Caucasian or Hispanic exes. Hmm. She found some old charges on there from when he was a young wreckless teenager and used that against both of us. Now that she is pushing 80 and both her and my dad are visibly worn out because clearly they didn't know wtf they were doing like they thought,  she has finally relented and \u201clet me\u201d get my daughter back... after she has checked her into mental hospitals over the years and had her on all kinds of medications, switched her school to a weird private school, and done everything for her from cutting her food to bringing it to her while she lays on the couch. Daughter was already a highly intelligent neurodivergent (not nonverbal) but had a hard time with some things such as sensory issues and how to act appropriately in social settings and all my mom did was make it worse. My daughter now doesn\u2019t even know how to fold her own clothes or anything. \n\nMy husband was raised in a very strict Christian homeschool home where they had ridiculous rules and were big on manners and made all the kids do farm work on the weekend. We don\u2019t see eye to eye on some things because while I don\u2019t want to parent like my mom and I do want to instill independence in her, I think some things are over the top. He makes a big deal about her sitting on her feet/folding her legs beneath her at the table for example.  As a fellow ND I don't think it\u2019s a big deal because that\u2019s how I sit, it's comfortable and I just think we need to pick our battles. We got into a huge argument about it because he asked her to put her legs down at the kitchen table while she was eating and i told him it wasn\u2019t hurting anybody. He thinks I undermined his authority and that I should\u2019ve just agreed with him and I told him I should be allowed to disagree because that\u2019s normal. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal but he feels so disrespected. He thinks I am too lax but in the back of my mind I\u2019m still competing with my mom who has mentally destroyed me and my daughter. Also my daughter makes random loud noises or randomly hops around and they weren\u2019t allowed to do that growing up, they had to use inside voices or his dad yelled at them. He doesn't yell or raise his voice but he usually retreats to our bedroom and puts on his headphones and plays Xbox or listens to music to get away from it, but later complains to me that she is too loud and disrespectful. She also claims to be trans and I honestly support her but he does not although he doesn't stop her from talking about it like he wants me to. He has threatened a couple of times to leave if I don\u2019t give him some form of control with her. I told him I don't want to do things the way our parents did (my mom being too passive, his dad being too aggressive). Please help. I feel slightly overwhelmed and I just want everyone to be happy but I'm losing myself in the process. \n\nSorry this is so lengthy, as mentioned previously I'm audhd and have a really hard time summarizing or condensing my thoughts, plus there's a lot to unpack.",

We have a 4 year old son who was diagnosed with ASD after I insisted that he was tested after not reaching appropriate milestones.\n\nBackground: My husband has a history of child abuse and neglect he also has low distress tolerance.  After I gave birth I required 2 blood transfusions and was only able to take a week off before classes and my internship started. While I try to be there to support my family, I feel like my primary contribution is financial and security wise. At home I have always been the \"bad guy\".  Which I admit is more easy to do when I have been working or in school most of the time.\n\nWith that said, my husband pretends to be on the same page and then does the exact opposite behind my back and encourages my son to keep this a secret (which feels groomy and weird but I don't want to read too much into this). In the past few months his eating has becoming out of control. My husband will avoid going into any stores with my son because he spends at least $100 on candy and toys each time. Recently I dropped them off at a museum and he spent $250 on stuffed animals, money we didn't have and so I had to count coins and re-activate my Uber account to pay for basic utilities. Then he let my son eat an entire box of family sized Froot Loops which resulted in disturbing G/I issues. He also sneaks him candy from work before I finish my day at 8:30PM. I work 10+ hours a day and when I finish. I am greeting by my usually wide awake, unwashed, unfed child asking me to go to bed.\n\nI try to buy all kinds of kid-friendly food for my family, I have made fruit salad, spinach tortellini, dino nuggets, fish sticks, ABC nuggets, secret veggie nuggets I just want him to eat anything that isn't candy. I have tried incentivizing him by having him eat real food before eating candy and my husband will give him candy and think it's a funny joke when he gets caught. Now my son has a sore on his mouth I think from all the sugar he has been eating. He also lets our 4 year old watch YouTube completely unsupervised and so he is watching CreepyPastas like SirenHead, God of Roadkill, Choo Choo Charles etc. It's disturbing. I have installed YouTube Kids, when with me we only watch Dora the Explorer, Sherif Labrador, Numberblocks, Octonauts and other kid-appropriate stuff. My son is intelligent and knows when I'm not around he can do whatever he wants so he doesn't want me around which at times is hurtful and embarrassing.\n\nI try to encourage my husband to follow through on these things as we both see the issues. He indicates that he feels resentful because he watches him the most. On the other hand, I have changed my work schedule to 4 days a week 10 hour days to accommodate our son's school schedule. I work part-time nights, full time and moonlight with Uber. I don't know what to do, I cannot quit my job to monitor my husband. I cannot afford a Nanny, I have been able to get help from my mom a few days but that is it.\n\nI'm worried about my son who already has challenges socially and his IEP considers him to be \"at risk\" for bullying talking about these creepy niche YouTube videos only to be seen as a weirdo. That on top of the concerns about him watching this inappropriate videos. I'm worried about his health. I feel like I'm at a loss. I am fine with being the \"Bad Guy\" but I cannot control/monitor my husband 24/7. Am I being insensitive to my son's needs?",

        "content": "For context I have been married for 5 years and have a 4 year old with my husband. She is the light of my life. I am a stay at home mom.\n\n\nA couple months ago my husband and I decided we wanted to have another baby. I bought pre-seed, hundreds of tests, i was taking vitamins, stopped vaping etc etc. Whatever I thought I could do to get pregnant. My best friend was also talking about getting pregnant at the same time and we were both so excited to have round bellies together. I REALLY wanted this baby. To be honest my husband and I have not had the best 5 years, and the pregnancy and birth of my first was very traumatic for me; but I felt like we were finally in a good spot and we were happy and I could do this. \n\nFast forward to now. As soon as I found out I was pregnant my happiness was short lived. I panicked HARD. I told my best friend how much I was struggling with how sick I felt, how scared I was to start over, how depressed I felt. It was hormones talking but we tell each other everything so I thought this was ok. Well she called me insensitive because she would \u201cgive anything to feel all those horrible feelings\u201d and basically told me I shouldn\u2019t be pregnant and it was a mistake. That really hurt my feelings and now we hardly speak. So that sucks, she was my only friend. \n\nI\u2019m 13 weeks now and this has been the hardest time of my life. I have hyperemesis and have lost so much weight I had to be hospitalized. I threw up probably 40 times a day no joke. It\u2019s starting to ease up now with all the meds I\u2019m on but I still have no energy. On top of that my relationship is doing terrible. I\u2019m super hormonal and don\u2019t feel like he\u2019s emotionally supportive enough, he feels like I\u2019m slacking as the home maker, it\u2019s all just a mess. All we do is argue and cry. His parents came to visit (my relationship with them is very strained) and long story short we had an argument in front of them and they\u2019re never speaking to me again. All because I felt they were disrespectful towards me. \n\nI also have the normal worries about starting over, money, etc. but i really worry I\u2019m going to lose myself entirely. Now that my daughter is 4 I finally had some free time to find things I enjoy and we could go on dates (not often) and it\u2019s just been easier. I feel like I\u2019m really pushing my luck by having another child. Everything was so much better before I got pregnant. And honestly if my husband isn\u2019t supporting me enough now I don\u2019t feel like he will be able to when the baby comes. I can\u2019t go through that again. I told him this before I got pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know\u2026..in a perfect world where I could afford help and my husband was the most caring gentle man on the planet i guess having a baby could be nice. But in my reality it doesn\u2019t sound nice anymore \u2026 It breaks my heart but I can\u2019t see myself being anything but extremely stressed. \n\n\nI wish I could wake up and not be pregnant anymore. Or go back in time and not get my birth control removed. I feel incredibly stupid and guilty. I booked my appointment in another state 5 hours away but I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll regret it or my husband will resent me. But i don\u2019t feel much better about a baby anymore either.

        "title": "Advice on managing 4 year old meltdowns",
        "content": "First post on here and a bit of a long one.\n\n**Backstory:**\n\nI (28F) have moved in with my partner (30M), who has a daughter (4) from a previous relationship. It\u2019s hard because he didn\u2019t want to have the child as the birth mother (BM) got pregnant after 6 weeks, but he is a great\u00a0dad. He\u2019s taken courses and we read a lot of parenting books together. He ended up taking his daughter for over a year when she was 1.5-2.5 as the mother kept leaving her behind with strangers at the flat she lived in so she could go party. He also did most of the raising, care, and feeding of her as a newborn while working very long hours.\n\nWe have her every weekend from Friday night to Sunday afternoon. The BM has her Sunday night - Friday. My partner picks her up from kindergarten on Friday afternoons. We both work full time 8-5 jobs, he\u2019s in sales and I\u2019m in advertising.\n\nWe don\u2019t have family where in the city we live so it\u2019s been hard but we\u2019re both lucky to have wonderful circles of friends who are very supportive. Unfortunately we don\u2019t have the resources yet to have full custody or have week on/week off just yet but that\u2019s what we\u2019re working up to.\u00a0We are based in NZ.\n\nThe daughter has gone through a lot of change lately! The BM moved apartments and she's had another baby, dad\u2019s partner living together, our own move into a new place, and starting kindy. \n\n**The situation:**\u00a0\n\nWe had a little sticker chart rewarding her for using her good manners, tidying up her room and toys, and brushing her teeth. It used to work really well. But the behaviour over the past six months has been getting exponentially worse. She hasn\u2019t earned a sticker for 2 months.\u00a0\n\nMeal times are grounds for a battle (even if it\u2019s food she likes and wants us to cook!) because she wants McDonald\u2019s, pastries, or nuggets for every meal. We get her involved early in the meal planning process, we ask her what she wants and she helps us out with the cooking, but when we get to eating she just refuses because it\u2019s not McDonald\u2019s. We compromise and say \u201cif you eat half of the dinner we\u2019ve cooked you, you can have {insert another healthy option but still one she wants}\u201d.\n\nShe\u2019s repeatedly said to us \u201cI can do whatever I want at mum\u2019s house\u201d. Naturally doesn\u2019t work well around here as I can imagine most adults are like \ud83d\ude42\u200d\u2194\ufe0f and if we don\u2019t say what she wants us to say, another tantrum - even if we say we like her socks. We have to say something else.\n\nWhat ends up happening is the tantrum and screaming gets bigger until she throws all of her toys out of the room and around the house (the consequence for this is that whatever is thrown gets taken away until later), rips off her mattress, knocks over chairs. We've implemented 'time outs', where we wait 4 minutes, check in on her, tell her we love her but the behaviour as to stop, and ultimately wait for her to calm down and my partner has a discussion with her. We ask her to repeat back what she has heard so we make sure she\u2019s listening.\u00a0But when she comes out and still tries to get her way, chaos resumes. \n\nShe has also taken to saying hurtful things like I don\u2019t love you, I hate you both, get out of my house etc. We tell her we love her constantly, and at worst we say \u201cwell you may not love us but we love you, even if your actions and words have hurt our feelings.\u201d We\u2019re very careful to not yell or lose our cool (it\u2019s so hard oh my god), the most we do is pick her up and put her in her room when she\u2019s slamming doors, or physically restrain her when she is hitting or throwing things.\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019re consistent and firm, but very loving. We\u2019ve explained that it might be confusing to have different rules in different households but this is what we do here because we love her and we don\u2019t like arguing either but boundaries are important to be a big girl (something she tells us she wants to be). We have conversations about what we expect in this household. It\u2019s okay to have big feelings but have taught her breathing exercises in the hopes she calms down before they happen. We\u2019ve trawled through reddit, books, asked our respective therapists, we have legitimately done everything in our power to help.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot of change for her and I think she\u2019s trying to regain control and test the boundaries as any kid needs to, but the aggression and meltdowns really are awful.\u00a0\n\nWe get to work on Monday absolutely emotionally spent after about 48 hours of what feels like dealing with constant screaming. She\u2019s already said to her mum she hates coming to ours and she hates us. We\u2019re worried we will lose her completely but we also don\u2019t know who else is setting firm but loving boundaries for the kid as every child needs. The mother is unfortunately the type to want to take full custody as well as the daughter is increasingly more upset about coming to ours.\n\nWe keep the BM and her partner as up to date as possible and try to have similar approaches across both houses, but when we tell BM and partner the daughter has broken toys, they wave it off and say \u201coh that\u2019s just a 4 year old being a kid\u201d so there's not a lot of support there. The BM doesn't believe in therapy either.\n\nFeeling quite nervous and vulnerable posting this, we feel like we're failing his daughter/my step-daughter. \n\nWhat else can we do? We\u2019re already so burnt out. It's been months. \n\nEDIT - update 4 months later:\n\nWe spoke to a family therapist who did a wonderful job taking us through how to manage the situation. \n\nWe\u2019ve stopped the rewards charts completely, it was putting too much pressure on her. She told her dad/my partner that she loves him but doesn\u2019t want to stay the night anymore. Quite aware for a 4 year old, we were really proud of her honesty. \n\nWe ended up asking the mother to take her full time to stop the constant back and forth between homes and it has worked. If she wants to stay we always give her that option but she loves going back to mum (where there are cookies and treats lol). Now she comes over on the Saturday or Sunday and we take her to do fun activities. It differs each weekend which is a little frustrating for making plans but we want to try to build up the excitement and safety of being at ours again. \n\nShe\u2019s sooo much more stable and regulated, she\u2019s doing \u201cnormal\u201d 4 year old whinging rather than full 6 hour tantrums, and she seems happy again. She\u2019s making friends at kindergarten and having less frustrations at little things, her resilience is building, and she\u2019s becoming such a joy to be around again. It\u2019s been a slow and incremental process and there is more work to go, but stability has worked for her. \n\nNaturally we are quite gutted to not have her as much as we\u2019d like but she is happy and stable and that\u2019s what is most important after so many changes. \n\nAt some point, my partner and I will look to buy a house together and when she\u2019s old enough we will see if she wants to do 50/50 or ask if we can take her full time, but the choice is hers.",

She\u2019s very young and may feel insecure and unsettled by the revolving home situation, especially given her past living situation. \n\nI would focus less on reward charts and more on giving her some sense of control within your home environment- is there anything particular she would choose for her bedroom, or for dinner, or activities to do together as a family. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t have the vocabulary yet to communicate what it is that\u2019s frustrating her, so maybe concentrate on continuing to provide the safe environment she needs to feel comfortable enough in order to be able to express big feelings and not feel overwhelmed by her emotions.",

The first thing she said when she saw my son for the first time in the hospital was \"even my baby would've looked like this\" and she cried.\n\nI once suggested adoption, but she wasn\u2019t open to it, saying \"it won\u2019t be my own.\" Recently, she confided in me that they were considering surrogacy. She had thought about asking her sister but was certain she\u2019d refuse. In the country where I live, commercial surrogacy is illegal so only someone who is related to you can be the surrogate. After hearing this, I discussed it with my husband and told her that i will be her surrogate even before she asked us. All of us were over the moon, especially my in-laws. She even gifted me a diamond pendant for Mothers' Day with a card which said \"Thanks for giving me the joy of experiencing motherhood\".\ud83d\ude2d\n\nBut fate has a cruel sense of timing. Just two days ago, I realized I\u2019d missed my period. A pregnancy test confirmed it \u2013 I'M PREGNANT! While this should be a joyous occasion, it has left my husband and me in a state of utter confusion. My husband and I have been using condoms as birth control ever since my son was born. Its a case of failed birthcontrol. We are thrilled about our own baby, but this means I can\u2019t carry their child anytime soon or maybe even never. The guilt and worry about how this will devastate my sister-in-law and her husband are tearing us apart.\n\nWe are heartbroken and don\u2019t know how to break the news to them. How do we tell them without causing unbearable pain? Any advice on navigating this emotional minefield would be deeply appreciated.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "This exact thing happened to us. Our family member that was going to be our surrogate got pregnant when her bc failed. All her children were much older already. She called my wife ugly crying saying there was an accident. We were immediately very worried about who died but then a little relieved she explained the situation. After the shock we were very happy for them. It took us another year but we found another person to be our surrogate. Everything worked out great and now our kid and their\u2019s are growing up together. \n\nThe intended parents will be upset. They have gone through a lot and this is definitely not the worst part. This is a detour not an end to their journey. They love you and they will be disappointed and sad but they will not be mad at you. \n\nMy advice is to have them be very public with their story, I am sure there is one, and let people know they are hoping to find someone special to help them. We ended up having two people related through marriage that we never even met before come forward and offer to help us. We had an amazing experience and have the most wonderful child today. We are about to start working on child #2! Good luck OP and enjoy your new babe!",

He has 2 older kids from a previous marriage that are 18 and 16. We gave up on ever having kids after trying on and off for 5 or so years because we were just getting up there in age. Then at the end of 2022, a miracle happened, I got pregnant, and my little man was born (4 weeks early) on May 8th 2023. \n\nI tried to restart oral birth control like 6 months ago, that's always worked for me, but my hormones must have still been wonky and they made me feel awful and nauseous all day for 4 days so I stopped. DH is a great dad, he's so supportive and very hands on and we have a really good handle on everything. I lost my WFH job last month and we've been making it work with only his income while I look for another job that allows me to stay home as much as possible with little man. Hubs is a CDL-A truck driver in the union and he's home almost every night and has a decent schedule with great benefits for us all. Well I've been nauseous and off for a few days so I finally decided to check and SURPRISE! I'm pregnant. I'm freaking out. We definitely can not afford 2 and with my health problems (type 1 diabetic with complications from previous years of not controlling it), I don't know if I can handle 2 under 2. Financially, we have options and can make it work, though it will be tight and require huge changes, but we always said if it happened it would be one and done. We already got our miracle baby. I don't know what to do. DH is leaving it up to me, we both agree it's not a good time and not keeping it is probably the smartest, but ultimately he says he will support the family either way, and I know he will. I know reddit is not going to help me make this decision, but some support or words of encouragement or stories of similar situations would be great right now.

Little background I\u2019m 28f and got married last year to my wonderful partner 29m  whom I known for 9 years. We always wanted kids but told ourselves 31-32 would be the ideal age for us to start trying because we wanted to travel, build up our finances and just enjoy married life for a bit. \n\nWell last week i was noticed some symptoms and my Oura ring said that my temperature was elevated for the past couple of days. I got the oura ring / natural cycles because I have pcos and never ever had regular cycles. It was just these last two months I\u2019ve gotten a period due to a change in diet. I felt like my body was finally getting back to normal. Amen ! This was a win because I\u2019ve been to a fertility doctor to atleast get a normal cycle and see why my body\u2019s never been regular after. After looking at my bloodwork he basically told me that\u2019s just how my body is,  he  recommend birth control for a monthly bleed but I\u2019ve had heart palpitations from birth control in the past (even on thee lowest doses) so I declined. He told me whenever I\u2019m ready to just come back\u2026. Ok ! Well I\u2019m not ready so I figured that without the assistance of medical help it will be an uphill battle for me to get pregnant. \n\nWell fast forward 3 months . With my Oura ring sounding the alarm , swore boobs and a bigger appetite than usual,  something told me to take a pregnancy test. Even though my app said ovulation wasn\u2019t until a couple more weeks ,  I took a test and long and behold two lines. I\u2019ve token so many in the past so I know this isn\u2019t me due to incompetence. I also got a digital one to make sure. Pregnant. I cried in my husbands arms \u201cI can\u2019t have a baby, we\u2019re not ready, there\u2019s things we wanted to do , things we needed to accomplish.\u201d\nI wanted us to have a farm house and for us to have a successful businesses.  I wanted the option to be able to take a year off of work with enough money saved. I would be able to just focus on raising my child for their  first year of life. We\u2019re still paying off debt and finally started to take our finances seriously. I\u2019m mourning the life we currently have already. It\u2019s only been 2 weeks. \n\nI just gotten a new job offer , which now I may have to decline because I would need to work there a year before I can get paid medical leave. So here I am scrambling on how to stay at the company I\u2019m currently at so I can keep the benefits. \n\nI know this isn\u2019t the babies fault at all. It\u2019s us for being so naive. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to give this child my all. I have little to no patience for kids in general. Seeing kids throwing tantrums irritate me to the core. Today I seen a pregnant women and almost bursted into tears because of fear and slight disgust. (Sorry) \n\n I feel bad for the couples that try and try but it takes years for it to come true and here I am ungrateful. I find myself being ok with a miscarriagriage (it makes me feel so sick to admit how relieved I would be ) .and no I don\u2019t believe in abortions. \n\nEven though I feel these things I find my self taking prenatals , staying away from cat litter and looking at what\u2019s safe for pregnant people to consume.\n\nSo parents and parents to be, how do I deal ,how can I move on. I want this to be happy time but I\u2019m just sick to my stomach. I see how parents give up their lives to raise their little ones and I here I am struggling to raise myself . \n\nSorry for any mistyped words or chopped English I\u2019m rushing this because I got to get back to work . Thank you  in advance. \n\nEdit \n\u201c I have little to no patience for screaming/unruly kids\u201d ** the ones that kick and scream when they don\u2019t get their way.

        "content": "Advice/recommendations/support please. The amount of stress because of our 3mo is mind blowing. I\u2019ll try and start from the beginning as there\u2019s so much to look at here.\n\nOur 2nd child, born at 36w5d due to my diabetes getting out of control and excessive fluid, has had a pretty bumpy ride so far. He was immediately sent to the NICU for respiratory issues, but was off the cpap in 2 days, then the issue was jaundice, where he then spent 2 days under the light. Then the last issue was feeding, which is how we spent most of the time in the NICU. He had an NG tube placed as soon as the cpap was taken out. He would never hit the 80% of feedings that the drs wanted to see from him. We got to the point where we were going to learn how to place it, but the next day my husband and I went in the nurses and drs were saying how well he did throughout the night and that they\u2019re taking out the tube and sending us home. I was excited but terrified as it was just such a sudden switch, since they had been saying it\u2019s going to take him a while and we were headed in that day to do our first placement, which thankfully we ended up not needing to, so we got to go home after 11 days in the NICU.\n\nAs soon as we got home and I fed him, it was the same battle we had been dealing with the whole NICU stay, he barely ate his bottles. We had already scheduled appointments with speech as they were the only ones at the hospital that saw he still wasn\u2019t very efficient and wanted to follow up. Each day was a struggle to get him to eat, but each appointment with speech they said he\u2019s getting more efficient and he eventually \u201cgraduated\u201d from speech after 3 appointments. Although, at the last appointment, the nurse pointed out he seems to have reflux and to watch out for it. I didn\u2019t really notice since he got to the point where he was eating 4-5oz with no problems and barely any spit up. This good period of eating well and no pain/crying/refusal lasted about 2 weeks.\n\nThis is when we noticed he definitely had reflux and it was causing him severe pain. Back arching, screaming, inconsolable, starting to eat less, everything. I brought it up to his doctor and she didn\u2019t seem worried as he was gaining fine, and suggested probiotics and hypoallergenic formula. These also did not help. I could tell it was only getting worse and kept scheduling appointments weekly for them to listen to me plead with them that he isn\u2019t doing well and at least needs to be put on medication. Finally, they saw that he was barely gaining anything and was dropping in percentiles, 95th (he was a big boy at birth) to 75th. At this point they finally listened and decided to put him on omeprazole. This seems to be curing the pain, but I\u2019m worried it has already gotten to the point where he might have a bottle and/or oral aversion. \n\nHe is now to the point where he will refuse to take more than 2oz, if even that since he is constantly spitting the bottle out of his mouth, UNLESS it\u2019s a dream feed, which he takes 5oz perfectly fine and has no reaction to the bottle. I also try to breastfeed him, and he does slightly better, but still thrashes around, arches his back, and can\u2019t seem to keep a latch on, until he finally just gets lazy and lays there to suck. We also try to give him his pacifier, which 75% of the time he spits it out after a few suckles, or he\u2019ll immediately try and push it out with his tongue. This is where I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s a bottle aversion or straight up oral aversion. \n\nHis doctor said to give him a week to see if the medicine helps at all, and if not she\u2019s going to refer him out to a GI dr. And we are at that week mark now, so I\u2019m giving them a call tmrw to let them know he hasn\u2019t gotten better with eating. So I guess I\u2019m just looking for anyone who has been through a similar scenario, advice, or recommendations. I already know about the Rowena Bennet book, but don\u2019t see that helping as we\u2019re already kind of doing that method. We\u2019ve also tried Dr. browns, Mam, and advent bottles, with different size nipples, but no improvement, as well as all the different feeding positions, different formulas, everything I can think of. I\u2019m at a loss, and pretty sure he\u2019s going to end up needing an NG tube or gtube at this point. I guess we\u2019ll see what they find at the GI appointment, but until then, I\u2019m just driving myself insane at this point.",

We are highschool sweethearts, and live in the town we both were raised in, so both of our families are close by. We have twin daughters, who are in Kindergarten. Lately, I've been wanting another baby. The baby fever is bad that I feel like I've been lit on fire. For 2-3 years now I've been asking my husband, and he keeps jumping back and forth about it. Well about a month ago, we got into a very heated argument about it. He is firm on no, because of money. He says we cannot afford it. Which is wrong, we can. He calls me a bad parent for wanting another kid, because I'm \"unsatisfied\" with our current children. I felt like crap..still do, but I need to find a way to heal myself and put this fire out that I feel deep down in my soul. Well, I figured it's time to get rid of all that baby stuff I've been saving in case we wanted another one. So, I told him I was going to start going through it all, and let our friends and coworkers who are currently having kids pick what they want and post the rest for sale on Facebook. This was a few days after our huge fight, and he said well what if an accident happens. So we should just keep it. I felt that little bit of hope flicker inside of me but than I remembered our fight and how he's been crushing my hope. I'm on birth control, IUD, and I've had it since we had the kids. Plus we are still using condoms. So we are careful. No accidents will happen unless I take it out. I know things can happen. I don't want the hope of it just sitting there. This last agreement felt like he ripped my heart out of my chest, and stomped it into the ground without a care in the world. It really hurt. Getting rid of things will make it easier to deal with it. So, what do i do? Get rid of the stuff so I can stop hoping for another child, or keep it, so the hope is still there and this argument will forever continue? Do I deal with him just going back and forth? I'm between a rock and a hard place. Help??",

        "content": "I guess I just needed somewhere to type all these thoughts and feelings out. My whole life I absolutely swore I would never have kids, I would never be a parent. It never felt like it would be the right path for me. I\u2019ve always struggled with mental health issues, and figured if I can barely take care of myself, I shouldn\u2019t be taking care of another human. The thought of having kids terrified me. At 25 my birth control failed and I fell pregnant. I was horrified and just broke down. My partner who has much more experience with kids and a larger family was excited and very supportive though. And he still is an amazing partner and father. We\u2019re very lucky to have him. I was also lucky enough to have a pretty smooth pregnancy. When my son was born I went in for an induction and in labor my anxiety was so bad I was puking. And they hurt me when they broke my water. The scariest part was that he passed meconium and aspirated it while I was in labor. He didn\u2019t cry when he came out and the nurses rushed away with him. I didn\u2019t even get to touch my son until 3 days after he was born. We didn\u2019t get to see him until several hours after I had him. Part of me wonders if that is partially why I struggled so much to bond with him. After that we were in the NICU for a month. I mostly lived at the hospital with him and only left when the nurses insisted that we go take care of ourselves too. When we finally took him home and he was no longer on oxygen and heart rate monitors, my anxiety became the worst it\u2019s ever been. I didn\u2019t sleep for weeks because I was so afraid all the time of messing something up with him. It got to the point where I was wishing for death every single day. I didn\u2019t want to exist anymore because I hated myself and I couldn\u2019t take constantly being panicked anymore. I felt no bond with my son. Which just made me feel so much worse and like a complete failure of a mother. Not sleeping affects me very badly and I was at my breaking point. I just kept hoping and waiting for it to get better. Now he\u2019s a toddler and he\u2019s an amazing child. We did finally bond once I got treatment for the anxiety. However a few months ago we moved halfway across the country. Now that I\u2019m away from home and I\u2019ve been off my medications I just want to run away from this life. I always dream about what my life would be like if I didn\u2019t have a kid. I feel like I never got to enjoy life for myself and now I never will because I just have to be a mom. I have medication on the way as I recognize I\u2019ve not done well without it. And I do love my son. I just wish I didn\u2019t have all these negative feelings. When does it get better? How can I be better for him?

I have 2 boys, he has 3 girls (mom died) and we have a 6 month daughter. I am NOT a SAHM and work full-time plus in the military. The biggest issue in our home is laziness and cleanliness. My husband's kids are slobs. They'll make a mess and completely walk away unphased. The nastiness doesn't bother anyone but me. My husband doesn't clean anything and will also leave messes around the house. He isn't much of a provider since I do literally everything. I pay most the bills, I do the housework, I have to keep the yard together since it doesn't bother anyone when it's messy. I take care of all of my own expenses and my kids stuff. I have to help him with his kids, buy most the groceries and the weight of our 6 month old falls primarily on me as well. He wouldn't even help at night with her because \"he works\" so obviously his sleep is more valuable than mine. I'm drained it doesn't help I'm pregnant from my birth control failing. I do not want this pregnancy and I'm really struggling accepting it. I know the weight of this kid will fall under me as well! Idk what to do but I feel like I'm going to really hurt some feelings by bringing everything up. I've had this conversation with my husband about everyone being nasty in the house and him doing the bare minimum multiple times. He feels he does more than enough to help out. If he gives the baby a bath, he's \"helping me out\", washing bottles is \"helping me out\". Like, literally the bare minimum is always seen as \"helping me\". I'm just over all of it. I'm more stressed in this marriage than anytime I was a single parent.",

        "content": "I\u2019ve been suffering from depression and anxiety from it recently and I can\u2019t cope with it. I\u2019m a 34/F mother to a 14 year old boy, I have been together with his father since I was 17 high school sweethearts. I got pregnant at 20 and have been a stay at home mom ever since. It\u2019s always been just us 3. My partner always wanted more kids but I never did and went on birth control soon after having my son. I was on bc for over 12 years and just this week came off the iud, not to try to have kids again, but just to stop being on hormones after being on it for so long. My son\u2019s always been ok with being an only child. He has cousins his age who we see on a regular basis. So I guess that always comforted me knowing he had them. Now I am living from my mistakes from not having more kids when I younger.  I know I still have time but it\u2019s just not the same of having them growing up all together when they\u2019re younger. \nNow that he\u2019s a teenager the holidays aren\u2019t the same. I used to decorate my house for every holiday and I just don\u2019t find joy in it anymore. I don\u2019t feel needed anymore. If I\u2019m gone all day no one cares. \n \nIt just gets me so sad seeing him growing up and knowing he can leave the nest in 4 years. I know I can\u2019t stop time and we\u2019re all getting older (which is also triggering me). I always only wanted one child and it never bothered me only having one, but now it\u2019s effecting me so much. My plan was to travel later in life and not worry about who I would leave my kids to and now when I think about traveling I get sooo much anxiety.  \n\nI just don\u2019t know how to deal with these feelings it\u2019s been drowning me. I just want to get over it and be happy, live in the moment but I just can\u2019t. I cry every day thinking about it. It\u2019s all I think about. I know it\u2019s a blessing having him healthy and alive. I tell myself that, but it\u2019s just not enough for me to snap out of it. I\u2019ve even started therapy hoping it will help but I\u2019ve only done a couple of sessions and not really getting much help from it yet. I\u2019m trying to be patient about it. I\u2019m not on meds for my depression/anxiety I\u2019ve been trying to fight it on my own. \n\nI know there\u2019s others who might be dealing with this as well.

I feel like I have lost myself. She has a boyfriend (who we really like and hangs here mostly). I sometimes wonder if I\u2019m too involved because I only have one. Idk. I am constantly giving advice to her. I have completely disconnected from my husband because I am so just down right consumed by her. It\u2019s actually sad and I will admit that. It\u2019s actually scary how alike our stories are down to coming off birth control. My husband wants more but I can\u2019t fathom starting over. I do work which I have to admit helps a lot but it doesn\u2019t completely distract me. I feel like I\u2019m sick to my stomach 24/7. I have these irrational anxiety driven fears of every little detail of her life. Now throw in a high school relationship which I support big time may I add. However we all know\nOthers say ohh it won\u2019t last but idk it could. Am I crazy for thinking that? They care about each other a lot and literally talk through their disagreements. It\u2019s actually amazing to see. However we have the constant struggle of dealing with his parents who let them hang out but it\u2019s very limited and my daughter takes it VERY personal. It\u2019s giving me terrible anxiety watching her struggle. I some days wonder how I function. I wish I had advice but I guess I came here to say I SEE YOU and your feelings ARE valid and VERY real.

        "title": "Divorcing with a child\u2026So many emotions",
        "content": "I am probably just venting, I don\u2019t know what kind of advice could help me. This is a novella! Kudos if you make it to the end! \n\nI\u2019m (44F) in the process of divorcing my husband (50M). We were together about 15 years. We have one child together (7M) and I have 2 adults sons who my husband somewhat helped raise. We were in the same house, but he wasn\u2019t very involved. \n\nReasons that I\u2019m divorcing him: \n\n1.) Financially, he gets mad and won\u2019t pay bills. Red flag during dating: we lived in his parents\u2019 home rent free, but he told me that they\u2019d started charging rent to make me pay more than what was agreed upon (splitting bills) when I moved in. Later found out that it wasn\u2019t true. His mom justified it though, saying he needed the money. She helped him to fool me initially, but eventually admitted it because I suspected it. She\u2019ll do anything to keep him happy, including lie for him and give him money when he doesn\u2019t feel like working. She\u2019ll tell me the truth and beg me not to say she told because he\u2019ll get mad at her. They both lie without seeming to feel guilty. I could say more about this duo, but I\u2019ll move on. You get the idea. \n\n2.) Manipulative- he throws tantrums and tries to guilt me into whatever he wants me to do. Early red flag: We agreed on a name for our son while I was pregnant. He got the 1st name that he wanted, so I got to pick the middle name (after my dad). He waited until I\u2019d had our son and was recovering and was just high off pain medicine and happiness to convince me to slide his dad\u2019s middle name in too, so my son has 2 middle names. His dad\u2019s name is the name of my nephew who died soon after birth, so I wouldn\u2019t have agreed in other circumstances and he knew that. \n\nLater example: He\u2019d regularly try to guilt me into sex even though he was being rude and argumentative to me (ex. 15 middle of the night texts and calls telling me how I\u2019m coming up short as a wife for not having sex). He admitted (once) recently that he has a sex/porn addiction, but never again. He would push sexual boundaries even when I said I wasn\u2019t interested and I\u2019m pretty open minded, so it was a lot. \n\n3.) Name calling and screaming when upset, but only when others weren\u2019t around. He\u2019d stop if I started recording him because he didn\u2019t want there to be evidence that he wasn\u2019t always the nice guy that he presented to the outside world. He only did things like open doors for me if others were around. Once, I was walking in heels in a gravel parking lot. There was nobody else out there. I tripped and fell, skinning my knee. His 1st reaction was to laugh. Hard. He apologized, but that stuck with me. \n\n4.) Hands off parenting- When upset, he\u2019d go days without seeing our son. He almost never helps with homework or bath/bedtime routines and doesn\u2019t keep up with what\u2019s happening at school. Our son struggled in reading (just more interested in math, which is easy for him) and I paid for additional tutoring. He wouldn\u2019t contribute and complained about the cost, but our son is at grade level now and enjoys reading more. \n\nWhen I first mentioned divorce, he brought our son into a room that I was in, stood at the door, held our son\u2019s hands and fake cried and said he couldn\u2019t be a good dad because mommy didn\u2019t want to be with him. I know, manipulation. \n\n5.) I don\u2019t even know where to classify this, but if he\u2019s denied sex, he\u2019d do things like wake me up all night, turn lights off and on, shine lights in my face to wake me up, call me back to back to argue, etc. Not sure how that\u2019s supposed to get a girl in the mood, but that\u2019s what he did. Once, he was mad at me and came into the previously locked bathroom while I was showering and stared at me and made me really uncomfortable. He\u2019s snatched my phone from me before and gone through it. I\u2019m not a cheater, so not sure what he was looking for. \n\nNow he\u2019s fighting for split custody. In real life, before this week, he\u2019d never been responsible for our son overnight without me. I almost had a panic attack when the judge ordered my son to be with him overnights. I was willing to do anything but that, not because of how he\u2019s treated me (my son almost never was around for his antics), but because of his medical issues and drinking, he\u2019s a hard sleeper. Alarms don\u2019t wake him up, my son is basically fending for himself for hours on end. In the past, I\u2019ve made a ton of noise and then left the house with my son when I came home and he was asleep, but my son wasn\u2019t, and he never knew until hours later. He isn\u2019t a reliable adult and when sleeping and he sleeps a LOT. The judge says my son can use a phone, so this was no reason to deny overnight stays. He presents it to his friends and family as if I\u2019m controlling & don\u2019t want him to have a relationship with our son, when in reality I\u2019ve pushed for years for him to be a more involved parent.  It could be a combination of a sleep disorder, drinking, and depression, but I\u2019ve never trusted it enough to leave our son with him very long if I wasn\u2019t there, so I\u2019m scared. \n\nDespite ALL of this, and trust me, I\u2019m not \u201cdumb\u201d. I in no way think that this how relationships are supposed to be, but a small part of me just wishes that he\u2019d fix his issues (for real, not just long enough to get me back) and we could stop all of this. I KNOW it\u2019s not going to happen, but I\u2019m sad for the dream of a happy marriage that\u2019s now officially shattered, I\u2019m sad for my son, I\u2019m sad for my ex, because being this person that he\u2019s turned out to be can\u2019t feel good. I wonder if he was always this way and I was too blind to see it.  I feel so broken and I hate this feeling. I don\u2019t know how to move forward and honestly even though it\u2019s sad to think of being alone, I wouldn\u2019t even trust my instincts when it comes to the opposite sex anymore. I hate this and I\u2019m so tired of crying about it. \n\nYes, I\u2019m in therapy. We were in it together because I told him that the only way I\u2019d stop the divorce was if he agreed to fully participate in intense therapy. Last month, he started refusing to go and he wasn\u2019t fully participating in it anyway. Our therapist basically asked me one day how long I intended to keep doing this. That was pretty eye opening. I\u2019m also getting my son in therapy ASAP. I wish that I could protect my son from his dad using him to punish me (wound up needing an order of protection, so he\u2019s offended and angry). I hope that\u2019s not his actual goal, but it feels like it is. \n\nI\u2019m just extremely down right now and my family seems to think that because of all the wrong he\u2019s done, I can just say \u201cscrew him\u201d move on, and be happy. I smile and laugh, and I\u2019m at peace in my home (finally), but I cry at the drop of a hat and I\u2019m SO far from happy.\n\nThat\u2019s all.",

I've gone through hell and back with my ex and parents. I had my son for a while after escaping DV. I was living with my new partner on and off last year. Long story short, my vindictive ex tried to put my new partner in the family court so I was forced to leave.\n\nI have been living with my partner again for about 8 months. We have been together for over 2 years. We really love each other so much.\n\nI am thankful for the second chance as I would've been living in the street or a share home since I'm in a mountain of debt.\n\nMy partner and I have talked about having a child of our own. We tried last year and we thought I  was infertile as nothing had been happening. She had one miscarriage and we assumed I was not able to properly fertilise and circumstances were not right.\n\nMy partner has anxiety, OCD, intrusive thoughts and had a traumatic experience with her kids. She went through post partum depression and was given the wrong medications. She nearly died during childbirth 10 years ago. She had bowel cancer young and she was diagnosed with cushings disorder during childbirth following incorrect medications to treat bad post partum depression. Her mother tells me that my partner had thoughts of hurting herself and the baby. Her ex was busy cheating whilst she gave birth with her cousin by her side (her mum watched the eldest child).\n\nHer ex had spoken about wanting to terminate. He doesn't see his kids. I'm the step dad to her daughters but her mum is over protective and controlling. All the housework gets left to my partner and I'm trying to help.\n\nThese traumatic experiences have scared her family and friends. Her mum has autoimmune disease and her hands are curling up. She isn't in a position to help out.\n\nWe spoke about how we should get ourselves established, let her grow her online business and concentrate on moving out of her parents' home. I thought that was sensible and she told me to wait a couple of years and we will try again.\n\nWell she is getting her health checked including chronic infections in her sinuses, severe arthritis in the back, low iron and ongoing gastro reflux and coughing.  She has chronic asthma. She wants to grow her business and eventually go to sing at gigs. I understand this as I want to work on improving myself and starting a side venture.\n\nA few days ago we think she fell pregnant. Tummy started to grow. Period never came. But she got bodily changes such as light pink sporting and when she wipes is still a lot of light pink. Pregnancy test at home, blood test and ultrasound all negative. Mood swings have been bad. Severe cramping. Short of breath. Pale. Hot and cold like infection. Bad cough. Fatigue. Vomiting like morning sickness lasting all day (I note that she had nausea and vomiting before then). Intrusive thoughts and waves of anxiety. Strange rashes on her body. Frequent urination. Bad stabbing pains in her side.\n\nI have been her rock for this. She is very strong minded though. I'm very affected. Because it has been up and down in her mind whether or not to keep with everyone saying definitely don't. We had spoken a lot about having a child of our own and now it feels like it has been ripped away from me. I felt devastated and cry because it feels like I am having the ability to have another child ripped away from. Or being forced to choose between a great love and having a child.\n\nI'm worried about her health too like everyone else! This morning we spoke about baby names. She has on and off talked about logistics. Then decided no matter what, the medical termination is the best choice in a couple of weeks followed by getting her tubes tied because she is too high risk. Talking about how she is sorry she can't give me a child.\n\nIt has been a rough journey for us :(\n\nI keep praying things can be different. I think deep down that I wish things were different. It hit me very hard because I've really fallen for my partner. It was one of the things that attracted me to her and it was always in the tarot readings she did. She is a medium too. We seen a sign today from God. We were praying at church when the light suddenly started shining through the windows when we asked if we should keep the pregnancy.\n\nSo I've spent a sleepless night just praying for a miracle turnaround in a couple of weeks before she chooses to terminate.\n\nShe is going to doctors to check. I told her to \n\nAm I being selfish? I love her and don't want anything to happen to her.

When I fell pregnant with her it was by total accident, I was on the birth control pill, I was in a toxic on/off relationship with a man, we\u2019ll call him sperm donor (SD) that wasn\u2019t ready to be a father. I accepted it, reassured him I wouldn\u2019t take him to court for child support since I feel like a relationship holds more value than a monthly payment. While my daughter was 2 months old I started talking to a man that I went to middle and high school with. I told him my desire to find a partner and father figure for my daughter. We started dating when my daughter was 4 months old fell in love and got married rather quickly and haven\u2019t regretted it one bit. My husband has never treated our 3yo anything other than a daughter and he is all she knows as a father. During IR\u2019s life, SD never reached out to see if she was healthy, never made any attempt to see her or plan any visitation, all he did was get a free paternity test through child support, when results came back they automatically put him on child support of $50 a month. We ended up moving to another state, before I moved I sent SD letter of where IR and I will be living and to contact me via email and provided the email, just in case I changed my phone number; never heard anything. After 6 months of no letter or contact I closed the child support case, I never cashed a single check. Then I opened up a family law case to get SD\u2019s rights terminated as it has been 1.5yrs of no contact from him while also doing a step parent adoption. He tried to say I hid IR from him etc. and that he would reach out to me to plan visitation, SD never did. He then requested a relinquishment of his right but never signed and then ended up in jail. Here we are with my daughter IR 3.5yo and SD just got out of jail as he was convicted of domestic violence (while the girl was pregnant with his kid), has pending charges (one is a felony another is 2nd degree assault) and is on probation and randomly wanted to talk to about getting in IR\u2019s life. He has no job, no car, no relationship with IR and just expects to hop back in as he please because he\u2019s \u201cblood\u201d. We are proceeding with court to see if they decide his rights should be terminated. I\u2019m just really nervous about what the judge may decide, I just want my daughter to be safe, I want her to have consistency and stability in her life, with SD in the picture I can\u2019t trust IR will get that. Is the proof in the pudding? Is there a chance that his rights won\u2019t get terminated? Am I doing the right thing?",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Honestly, it depends on your state and your judge. They decide what is best for your child, and they might decide that having contact with SD is what\u2019s best for her. I don\u2019t want to scare you, but just be prepared for that possibility. \nMake sure you have all of the documentation that you can get where you told him where you were going, and gave him your email. Also any time that he said he would visit and then didn\u2019t whether it was before or after you moved, any time you reached out to him and he didn\u2019t respond or follow through, etc. \nShow that you made every effort to have him in her life, and he chose not to.",

        "content": "I have a 7 year old, almost 8. Every day I find myself sinking further and further into the idea I genuinely hate her. I am constantly miserable when I am around her. I cry all the time cause she pushed me to the brink of my sanity. I have some time away, but it can't undo the misery she inflicts, and is not frequent enough to matter. I always dread having to go back. There's only one person I can rely on to take her for the night, and I feel horrible for doing so cause she's a dismal child to be around. She does the same things to them as she does to us. \n\nShe's had a wonderful life.  Never lacked anything, strong family with both parents, no financial hardships, she's had everything she could need to succeed in life. She has a tutor to help with her education needs, a therapist to help with her out of control emotions, and many things she can do to stay entertained. However, everyday it's a struggle and a screaming session. I'm always being told she hates me, or that I'm stupid, or she wants anyone else but me, or she wishes we would die. Every day I walk on eggs shells trying to get her to do her school work. Otherwise,  she will screech at the top of her lungs when she gets told to do anything. This happens 4-5 times a day. \n\nThere were times when her good outweighed the bad. Like we could overlook the tantrums cause she would be good and kind the rest of the time. Now, she's good only when she's getting something she wants. We only resorted to spanking with our barehands when she does something serious. Meanwhile punishments are time out, no electronics for the day, and losing privileges. Rewards, incentives, prizes, point cards, nothing works for her. \n\nLately, punishment has born no threat to her. She carries on with whatever she wants. I ask her to do something, she says no. I give her a her two options to choose from and she wants neither. I put her in time out, she devolves into screaming, throwing things, and hours of misery.\n \nWe are in the process of testing her for spectrum disorders. Insurance is being a shit about finding a diagnostician to help that process. However we are aware there could be underlying issues. Her therapist knows of this, so she tries to give us advice in accordance to those needs. I feel she needs medicine for her outbursts and uncontrollable anger. \n\nIn the end, it's harder and harder to look at her and not see a demon sent from hell. Especially when she screamed loud enough to hurt my ears. When I constantly believe if I had known about how things would turn out, I would have aborted the pregnancy or gave her up after birth. Life with her is hell. But what can I do? I'm in this mess and I can't go a week without thinking about disappearing and never coming back. I'm at wits end. \n\n\nFor a bit of clarity. These are my inner thoughts and feelings over the struggles I'm facing every day. I'm speaking out of pure inner termoil, that I know others have faced. And anyone who says they never thought anything like this are lying the everyone and themselves. \n\nI'm looking for advice on ways to help with emotional disconnect and managing undiagnosed autism or ADHD/ODD. Things that worked for someone else with a similar situation. Or perhaps some trick force the insurance or doctors to take action faster. \nHell, even some tricks you found useful to help you when you were feeling this way would even be welcomed. \n\nI'm not here to have unsolicited derogatory remarks on my choice to spank my child. I believe the punishment should fit the crime. Sending chats accusing me of child abuse will only get you blocked, and yes it's happened already. I'm not here to be berated or be talked down to. I shouldn't have to defend myself here. \n\nSo please, if you don't have advice or uplifting comments, don't respond.",

We spend time together, we connect, we aren't perfect, but it's a solid marriage.\n\nI have struggled with being a dad since day two. First child was our choice. Very difficult in the beginning, but improved. I 100% did not want child two. Wanted a vesectomy, but was threatened with divorce if I did not wait a period of time. I do not think my wife meant it, but having a second child was very important to her. We all say things when emotional (myself included!). (A marriage is two imperfect people trying their best). We ended up pregnant with a second child with her on birth control (but I wasn't using protection on my end so I own that) and to be honest I've never felt more sick emotionally (even with my younger sisters untimely death).\n\nOverall it's just been a really tough five years. Honest truth is, I don't really love my kids. I do what I do out of duty and hope things would be better in the future. I do try to be a good dad, a thoughtful dad and the way I would like to be treated. A therapist asked me if I loved them and truth is truth. I love my wife, our friends and her family however and losing her would be irreplaceable.\n\nLately, it's been harder with kids fighting and the noise. Always the noise of screaming, whining and neediness. I've never been the most emotionally stable (nothing crazy, just envious of people who can go through life super steady), but lately I'm starting to get anxiety attacks from the constant screaming, early wake ups and the overall crushing of the positive things in my life from children. Anyway, it's hard. Everyone has it hard to some point.\n\nI and as a result, our family have done well financially for ourselves at my age of 38. Nothing celebrity status, but mid seven figure wealth. How can we leverage these resources to make life tolerable, because that's the best I think I can do. We do date night once a week. I've had a baby sitter come when my wife is at a conference. My father in law picks up kids after day care. I understand for some my life is easy, I get that, but problems are problems.

It is worth every penny.\n\nAlso, start doing lunch dates / afternoon dates instead of (or as well as) date night.

        "content": "Hello all.  I (46m) have a 7yo son.  From birth, he probably had some sort of a problem inside of his ears that caused him to not be able to hear very well.  As he got older and began talking, we noticed him having difficulty mimicking sounds and words.  We also noticed him seeming to not be able to hear us talking to him at times.  He was prone to ear infections and would often run his ears out of discomfort.  \n\nMy wife (35f) and I addressed this as soon as we could.  We had his hearing tested and it turned out that he did have hearing deficits.  Around the age of 5, we had ear tubes inserted and this helped with both the rate of ear infections and seemingly has improved both his hearing and speech.  He is currently seeing a speech therapist at school (he is in 1st grade now), and his speech continues to improve.\n\nAnyhow, he has continued to have some difficulty with focusing, concentration, and following instructions.  He has gotten in trouble at school a handful of times (maybe 3 or 4 times) since he began kindergarten - mostly for talking during class.  He also needs a very regimented routine for sitting down to homework and studying.  If we don't follow a set routine with consequences, etc. - he is prone to run down the street to play with friends or became rather upset when we get him to sit down to his schoolwork.\nHe can also be easily distracted at times and this comes through in poor performance and grades on things that he does during school - tests, in-class assignments, etc.\n\nMy wife wants to get him tested for ADHD, which I am not necessarily opposed to.  The next part of this story is very difficult to explain, and I hope someone else will understand where I am coming from with all of this.  It is NOT to point fingers or blame, but to illustrate certain differences that my wife and I have in our approaches to things.\n\nMy wife and I are both very busy, as - of course - many parents are.  We have always both worked, so there was no stay-at-home parenting.  I am a business owner and my wife is a manager over multiple offices.  Coming home to do our most important job of parenting has often been conducted sloppily due to work being brought home by both my wife and I, as well as stress and/or fatigue.  I know for a fact and freely admit that I did not put in enough effort with my son to help when problems at school began to crop up.  After his Kindergarten year, I vowed that I would change my schedule to always sit down with him to do his homework as well as come up with ways to improve his concentration and focus abilities (memory games, flash cards).  I have been doing this regularly for his entire year at 1st grade so far, although there have been times that I have not followed through to the best of my ability.  Speaking for my wife, she has brought work home with her and has virtual meetings during after school time.  When I have not been there and she is doing her work, which often goes past 5 or 6pm, our son has taken advantage of her inability to oversee his activities and he will run off to go play with friends or sit on his tablet for extended periods of time, usually without my wife being aware.\n\nNow, this is where things are going to start sounding judgemental and comparative \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14.  When I am home with the kids (we also have a 12yo daughter), I literally drop all of my duties and I am all-in on parenting.  I understand that I have the luxury of being able to control my work-flow better as I work for myself.  But, I have dropped my responsibilities at the expense of my business as well.  There are definitely things that I should be doing from home every day, but I put all of that off until the kids are asleep, and then I am up until midnight or later every night.  I have been on this schedule for about a year.  I cook meals, get the kids involved in cleaning their rooms and other house chores, and then make sure the kids understand that school work is to be done before going to play with friends or have time with electronics, etc.  I know that my wife is not able to do the same thing and even dinner doesn't offer get served until I come home and prepare it.  So, three days out of the school week she is home alone with the kids until about 6 or 7pm, and two days out of the school week I am home with them until about the same time.\n\nNow, I want to provide a quick example of something that happened within the past couple of months.  Our son has spelling tests every week in school.  Gets the words on Fridays and then the tests are on the following Thursday.  He was not doing well on these tests.  He would get 9 or 10 wrong out of 12 words.  So, in January, I began sitting down with him and going over 6 of the 12 words every day: reading them out loud, spelling them out loud, and then writing the words 3 times each.  We would do this twice a day for the entire week leading up to his test.  The first test he took after using this method, he got 10 out of 12 words right.  So, I continued using this method and was encouraged by his improved performance.  So was he.  But, he is not always open to putting in this extra work and it sometimes leads to clashes where he will refuse or shut-down.\n\nJust two nights ago, I was in the middle of doing this with my son and my wife got involved because she noticed my son becoming impatient and upset.  I also noticed these things and I am aware that kids need \"brain-breaks\", etc.  But, in this particular moment, I was attempting to push my son a bit more through his discomfort with the task.  Perhaps this was wrong, but I do firmly believe that kids need to be pushed and challenged at times to develop.  My wife took over the situation and allowed my son to not do the complete learning activity.\n\nWe got into a little argument about that yesterday.  She says that I am pushing him too hard and not paying attention to his needs.  She says that I am doing it more for myself than for him.  She has also been the one who is a proponent of having someone test him for ADHD whereas I have wanted to wait until second grade begins before getting him in to see another professional, as he has already been through so much because of his ears (speech therapy once a week, chiropractor twice a week, ENT every 6 months, the ear tubes, etc.).  \n\nI believe that we need to keep encouraging our son to keep developing a routine and good habits for, not only studying, but also for how he conducts himself both at school and at home.  I am constantly coming up with new ways to help keep him engaged and aware.  I just ordered items to start doing a behavior chart with him at home.\n\nAnyhow, I feel that there is still much more consistent work to be done at home so that we can parent effectively and change some of our son's maladaptive behaviors.  I don't want to misrepresent what my wife is doing, but she seems to be using an approach that she believes is consistent with managing a child with ADHD, although she is only doing SOME of those things.  Managing children with ADHD also includes reducing distractions, involving all senses for learning, demonstrating consistency, etc.  And, I do not feel that my wife is able to do those parts of it.\n\nShe is now saying that my desire to push my son in order to see improvement is a selfish one.  But, I know that there is cognitive dissonance involved in all of this as well.  I don't think that getting a diagnosis of ADHD is going to help anything if we STILL aren't doing everything we can to put in the work with him at home.  I feel like my wife wanting to get the ADHD diagnosis is, in part, a way for her to validate her lack of patience or time to sit down with our son and do the work that needs to be done - in creative and consistent ways.\n\nThere is so much more to this story than I can even begin to write about here.  If anyone connects with what I'm beginning to say in this narrative, please give me your input.  Positive or negative.  I'm open to all thoughts and ideas.  Thank you.",

        "content": "After going no contact with my mom for 3 years, I made the decision to start talking to her again. Besides missing my mom, I have 3 kids who really don\u2019t know the other half of their family besides my husband\u2019s family. My mother and I were battling about me being in my children\u2019s lives since my now 6 year old\u2019s birth. \n\n2018 I didn\u2019t have my own place. I got pregnant under her roof with a guy I really didn\u2019t care for. She helped with the baby, but she kept wanting more and more control. She wanted half of my tax returns, not letting me hold my baby, not letting me take my baby once I found a place, constantly saying I was unfit. She felt my daughter was better off with her than me, and when I found a place she wouldn\u2019t let me take her. April 2019 I had my second child by the same guy, she\u2019s now 4 years old. There were differences there too since I didn\u2019t let her stay with my mom because she already \u201cclaimed\u201d my 6 y.o. I ended up being admitted for depression, she took them both on her accord. \n\nSince then I got a job, fell in love, got married, and moved in with my husband while being pregnant with my son back in August of 2020 and got my girls back.\n\nShe wanted to transition to them living with me because they had been with her so long, but she pushed back way too much. I was visited by CPS at least 3 times in the last year(she admitted to doing it once), don\u2019t really know by who else, but allegations of abuse when there was none and the constant intrusion upon my home, not to mention so many arguments, caused me to go no contact. \n\nFast forward to now. We\u2019ve been talking, there\u2019s concerns here and there, but I\u2019m just trying not to rock the boat and let the past be the past.  Anyway, my oldest daughter has been distressed every time she comes from her grandmother\u2019s home when the visit time is up. I get it, it\u2019s fun. There are more toys, there\u2019s more room, and there is a dog. I get it. \n\nSince she\u2019s been going back and forth, I\u2019ve been dealing with talking back, eye rolling, and just straight up defiance. It stresses me out to the point that there is angioedema on my face. Right now, I\u2019m losing sleep because I\u2019m needing advice, trying not to overthink. \n\n*rant*\nI\u2019ve been through it with my 6 year old ,and I finally got her evaluated after much strife. There is possible autism. During August 2020, both of my daughters came to live with me and my husband when my oldest was 2 and my middle had just turned one 4 months prior. My 6 year old shows signs of speech delay, but her baby sister developed alright, and she\u2019s a regular chatterbox. I also have a son, he\u2019s a bit behind in speech ,and I plan on getting him evaluated for autism. \n\nMy mother says that the speech delay is mainly a result of the kids not being around other kids before they started school and that my son needs day care because he\u2019s not fully speaking. My husband doubts this,and to be honest I\u2019m too stressed to even offer what I think. When they have differing opinions, I sort of shut down. I feel like I\u2019m having to choose a side when it comes to the difference in opinion? \n\nMe and my husband went through a lot because of my mom and the rest of my family. Not to mention his family isn\u2019t perfect either. Throw my overall sensitive, emotional, mood swinging self in the mix, you have a crazy soap opera that is on its 5th season. \n\n*end rant*\n\nYesterday my mother brought up how my daughter is happier with her and thinks she should live with her permanently. Ouch. Here we go again, I thought. She assured me that she doesn\u2019t want any money, she\u2019ll take good care of her, and that she\u2019s not happy when she wants to go home. \n\nI talked it over with my husband. She\u2019s not staying permanently, but I will permit her to go to her grandmother\u2019s every weekend and be back home Monday evening. I also changed my middle daughter\u2019s visit schedule to every other weekend with her baby brother. I\u2019m  not good at hairstyling so that also makes the schedule a bit tricky. Here\u2019s what I had in mind:\n\nKids go to school starting Monday after Spring Break. My 6 year old will be taken by her grandmother and my 4 year old(middle) will take the bus from our home as usual. I\u2019ll see them both in the afternoon and we\u2019ll continue the week as usual. \n\nEvery week my daughters need their hair redone. They get it washed every 2 weeks. My 6 year old will go and stay every weekend(Fri evening to Mon morning) but my 4 year old will go on Saturday and come back home after getting her hair done. She will not stay until the following weekend along with her baby brother. \n\nAfter all this, they will go to school and come home Monday through Friday, but my 6 year old will be the only one staying on Sunday nights.  It\u2019s tricky but not unreasonable. I\u2019ll still have her at home, but she\u2019ll be at grandma\u2019s every weekend. Sounds ok I guess. \n\nMy husband brought up concerns of her wanting control. \u201cShe\u2019s going to ask you to change their address, she\u2019s going to ask you for part our tax return, she\u2019s going to be able to claim her(my 6 year old).\u201d\n\nI ran this schedule, not my husband\u2019s concerns, by my mom, she didn\u2019t sound happy, but she didn\u2019t sound mad either. I did this because I do want my baby girl to be happy, but I still have to acknowledge that her reasons for staying with my mom aren\u2019t just because I\u2019m mean or don\u2019t have what she has. \n\nMy daughter is defiant and doesn\u2019t like being told what to do. She tends to talk back now after being around her grandmother, and everyday she\u2019s always asking about her. My mom thinks if I let her live with her, she\u2019ll grow out of it and come back to live with me. Oh my\u2026\n\nMy husband and I both think my mom is in denial about my daughter being autistic and possibly having a learning disability. She didn\u2019t say much about my middle child, because my middle child is always missing home and wants to call or come home, and my husband wouldn\u2019t dare let our son go for anything.\n\nI\u2019m just trying to be fair. So I\u2019m asking you now\u2026\n\nAm I wrong for not letting my 6 year old daughter live with my mom? Am I bad mom for making her stay home? Is this schedule an ok schedule?",

        "title": "Being a depressed parent SUCKS",
        "content": "I apologize for the long rant, this is literally just me complaining about life so... you've been warned.\n\nI (28F) have had clinical depression as well as other, not as relevant, mental health difficulties since I was a pre teen. A childhood of csa and complications mostly being the cause. I'm a lot more stable now and have a job, apartment and a stable relationship. Obviously I still struggle sometimes but I don't self harm or have strong suicidal tendencies so, I call that a win.\n\nI had a baby 2 years ago. I've always wanted kids even when I was terrified of having them. We are NOT super stable financially or anything. But birth control failed and... Pregnant.\nObviously we kept him, even tho we're not buying anything fancy and have to rely heavily on budgets, we make enough money to support him. If you're thinking \"don't have babies you can't afford\"... You're right. I wanted my baby, I love my baby, and he has clothes, a bed and healthy food, toys and books. Even if I wish I could buy him more, of everything, he is not neglected.\n\nI HATE my job. \n\nNot because it is a terrible job. I could list the good things that intellectually I know it has. But emotionally, I just hate it.\nI work for a US company, been here several years, making $2/hr, doing mundane repetitive tasks for \"production\", all of which ultimately do not matter at all. It's boring, I feel my brain dying from lack of thoughts. I want to have money and time to paint, or knit or whatever. Or the time to exercise or just go walk on the beach. Instead I sit all day at my computer fixing their sh*t.\n\nMost of all, I want to quit so I can be with my son. Half my paycheck goes to full time daycare, so he's dad can drop him off in the morning, and I can use my \"lunch\" break to go pick him up and come back home to work a couple more hours and then put him to bed. Everyday.\n\nI hate the \"I hate Mondays\" and the \"thank God it's Friday\" jokes from coworkers. Everyday, every week, for 50 weeks a year wishing it was Friday? Just to have 2 days off and then it's Monday again... Feels like f*cking dying.\n\n\nMost days a survive it. Very much \"one day at a time\". With mental health sometimes it's one minute at a time... Or just one glass of water at a time... Whatever works to make it that day.\nBut today, when my boss was pressuring me about a deadline, a deadline that means nothing, just another number. Yet they make you feel like a failure when you're trying your best. Like it's an important project when in reality it's just to make sure the company keeps making money. I had to leave, run 30 mins to get to daycare on time, because it's the end of the month and a taxi would be out of budget, get my amazing; beautiful baby boy, walk back, put him in front of Bluey, and go to work for 2 extra hours (unpaid)... Then dinner (second time I ate all day), bath time, bedtime.... I want to die.\n\n\n\nThe guilt is just too much. Now that I'm his mom I can't even imagine dying in \"peace\". The fantasy of not having to go to work tomorrow and just... Sleep...\nBut I'd be the mom who f*cked up her kid by killing herself. He would wonder if he wasn't enough of a reason for me to stay alive and fight.\n\nBut EVERYTHING I do, I do for him. I don't have a lot of money, I haven't bought anything for myself in 2 years, since I was pregnant and spared $50 to buy a couple of \"maternity\" clothes (just clothes in bigger size). And that's okay, I choose him. Everytime.\n\nI must admit it would be nice to work full time and have enough money left to buy myself a game, or earrings or a dress...\n\nAnyway I'm just rambling now... I'll stop...\nI'm off work, I finished my production for the day, my little grain of sand in this company to make sure the CEO remains a billionaire and I remain.... Here.\n\nAt least it's almost Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPs. I cried on the street walking back home with the baby because I passed a flower stand... I haven't had the money for something as unnecessary as flowers in like... 7 years... So there's that I guess....",

        "content": "Where to start. This is all quite a shock for me-naturally pregnant at 46 1/2 years old- this is not something I thought I\u2019d ever be saying. My SO and I don\u2019t live together-we have quite a rocky relationship. We had se@ once in January and somehow I knew I had gotten pregnant. But I thought that\u2019s almost impossible, I\u2019m worrying for nothing. I had just gotten over my period a few days before and while it seemed like I was ovulating, I thought no it\u2019s too soon-so I didn\u2019t tell him to use our normal method of protection. I felt like I was probably entering early stages of perimenopause when my breasts became sore and heavy-but then my nipples were perky-that\u2019s new I thought . I\u2019ve had my period pretty regular since starting at 13, so when the day came in the middle of February when I should have gotten my period and didn\u2019t I began to worry, researching on the internet like crazy and finding the vast majority of statistics stated natural pregnancy accounted for 1-2% at this age- so most likely I am in perimenopause. But then I started craving orange juice and Fritos with bean dip\u2026.strange perimenopause symptom I thought?\u2026. I had mild cramping, so each time I went to the bathroom I hoped to see that I\u2019d started my period. Last week, I was so exhausted I could hardly get out of bed- and Sunday morning I decided to take the test because I thought if this is perimenopause I am not going to make it, and needed to get on birth control or take something to regulate my hormones. So after grocery shopping and picking up a test- I got home finished my breakfast and took the test- it didn\u2019t even take more than a second to show positive. I began sobbing. I went over to my SO house and gave him the news- he\u2019s going to be 52 in July. He was supportive- but realistic- he will be 70 when the child is 18, I will be 65. Maybe if we were 5 years younger? I don\u2019t know I am at a loss. I am already a grandma- I have a daughter who is 23 and one who is 14. How will they feel about adding another sibling to the mix at my \u201cgeriatric\u201d pregnancy age. The child\u2019s nieces will be 4 and 3 years older than this child . I am struggling with my conscience, how could I be so irresponsible. Of course there is a high chance I will miscarry, but I might not. I\u2019ve mostly seen posts about women trying to get pregnant at this age- very little on someone who is pregnant and in disbelief. I researched how kids of older parents feel and most didn\u2019t like it- of course it\u2019s different for everyone. But to be a half a century older than my child that\u2019s crazy to me. I\u2019m about 6 weeks now- and coincidentally I am due the 23-25 of October. I had my first daughter on the 23rd and my second on the 25th different months though- so I find that quite crazy how consistent my ovulation is. I have until 11 weeks to decide what to do- as I guess there is a pill that can be taken until then. I just can\u2019t believe that this is something I am now having to consider at my age.",

        "content": "Growing up, I thought I never wanted children for a variety of reasons. My mother had me very young and always encouraged me to live an adventurous, childfree life. On top of that, all my siblings had tumultuous adolescence experiences and I could see first hand how challenging and heartbreaking that was for my mom to endure. Overall, kids seemed like the worst idea ever. In my late 20s I got married, and my partner shared my sentiment. To top this off, I was not even sure I could get pregnant. \n\nFast forward to a few years later. Life got a bit mundane. We\u2019ve traveled, bought a house and \u201cparented\u201d three dogs, yet life felt like it was missing something. After some soul searching, we decided that if the universe wanted us to have a child, then we would let it happen (aka I stopped taking birth control). Within a month I was pregnant. Thankfully my pregnancy was very easy, but it was hard to mentally grasp the reality that I was growing a little being that would be with us so soon. \n\nI am now 3 months pp and all I can say is I was so, so wrong about my initial perception of motherhood. My little baby brings me an absolute abundance of joy. She is quite literally the light of my life and I\u2019m so glad that my partner and I opened ourselves up to this possibility despite our previous desires. I now understand that my mom\u2019s experience is not my own. That said, I\u2019m still thankful for all the advice she\u2019s given me over the years. I would not be nearly the mother I am today if I had a baby in my early 20s (or with one of my exs). \n\nI go back to work in 2 weeks after 3 months off and it\u2019s breaking my heart. My MIL will watch babygirl 4 days a week and I\u2019m struggling to let go of some control. I\u2019m so thankful to have family support, but she can be a bit scatterbrained at times which makes me a bit nervous.

We continued living together for financial reasons but ultimately split completely when our daughter was around 2. \n\nThroughout those 2 years I\u2019d watch her on my own, take her on play dates with other friends children to parks, care for her as any parent would. Despite the fact that I worked night shift I would stay up to spend time with her when I wasn\u2019t working, and she would even come into the bedroom to wake me occasionally when she wanted to be with me.\n\nThe second her mother and I began living separately, she refused to let me see our daughter without her tagging along, afraid that \u201cmom not being there would traumatize her because she\u2019s not used to you\u201d. I spoke to various family lawyers but was unable to do more than the free consultation due to finances. This excuse over time would change to \u201cshe doesn\u2019t feel safe or comfortable with you\u201d even when I would be leaving our visits and our daughter would take my hand and say \u201cok bye mom\u201d while walking me to my car, she has never shown any signs of being uncomfortable or feeling unsafe with me over the past 8 years. I also found out her mom got married 2 years ago and never mentioned anything, she outright did not let me to be the father I wanted to be.\n\nThis behavior of not letting me see our daughter unsupervised continued until this last August when family helped pay lawyer fees and a split custody agreement was decided on where we start out with me having her during daytime only for a few months and then progressing to a regular every other weekend with dad type schedule with a weekday visit and holiday schedule. She broke the agreement a few times by refusing visits because she signed it without fully understanding the days I had her started with every other Saturday and Sunday, not just one of those days, until our lawyers spoke and hers basically told her to quit it.\n\nSince then seeing my daughter has gone as well as her mom lets it go, from the beginning she\u2019s refused to give me their address and drops our daughter off on my days, I believe to avoid divulging that information, almost every time she texts me notifying me they are on the way it usually contains some form of \u201cwe are on the way but she doesn\u2019t want to and is crying\u201d. When she\u2019s with me we have fun going places, watching movies, playing video games and other games, we set up \u201cslumber parties\u201d with blankets on windows and the lights out and watch shows or movies, play with our animals which she adores. She\u2019s in her own words talked about doing certain activities \u201cwhen I start staying the night\u201d.\n\nToday she was being dropped off and turned to me and said \u201cI don\u2019t want to come here anymore\u201d. I asked her why she feels that way and she just looked to her mom and didn\u2019t respond, her mother prompted her to use her big girl words, I picked her up into a hug (which she reciprocated) and asked what changed from the prior weekend when she talked about staying the night, to which she looked to her mom, shrugged, and hugged me again.\n\nI\u2019m not looking for legal advice here, I want to understand what changed, it seems like she doesn\u2019t fully know what she is saying or is maybe even being influenced or coached into saying this stuff, but I\u2019m not sure how to go about this, I don\u2019t want to sit my 8 year old little girl down and grill her about if her mom or stepdad have been saying anything negative about me to get her to not want to see me, or if she\u2019s being asked to say these things. \n\nHow do I ask an 8 year old these types of questions?\n\n\nTLDR: My Daughter went from enjoying time with me and talking about things we should do on future visits to saying she didn\u2019t want to come over anymore, I think her controlling mother has something to do with it but don\u2019t know how to ask a kid difficult questions.",

He\u2019s a wonderful young man with a bright future awaiting him. I busted my ass to make sure he was on a path of success, with all the opportunities I did not have in my upbringing. He isn\u2019t perfect, no kid is. He does less than desirable mistakes, like any teen. But overall, he is a good kid. He graduated this past year. He just turned 19 in the last month.\n A few months back- roughly Aug/sept he started talking to a girl that lives 1600 miles away via a popular streaming service. By Nov, they were referring to each other as bf/gf. He even bought her a promise ring.-yeah I know-They met for the first time less than a month ago and spent just over a week together. \nNow, obviously his dad and I really didn\u2019t want him to do this trip right now for a few reasons. Which we discussed thoroughly with him. \n1. He hadn\u2019t planned and saved, which wasn\u2019t very adult of him. Why couldn\u2019t he wait until spring and save up for this.\n2. He was behind on his car payment which his dad and I pay half and then he pays half. \n3. He was just making some very impulsive decisions, which wasn\u2019t really like him. \n4. He barely knew this girl and it was a very far trip, so that made me very nervous. Especially bc this state is filled with an abundance of high numbers in human trafficking. \n\nFor context, they talk every day via FaceTime. We\u2019ve talked to her. She does say some things that irk me- such as calling him an asshole, even if playfully, just seems an inappropriate way to speak to someone especially in front of their parents. She seems like a decent girl, she is a very pretty girl and- she is his first \u201crelationship\u201d- I\u2019m sure that\u2019s one of the biggest reasons he started chatting with her. Her home life sounds very chaotic and if I\u2019m being honest, much like the chaos I did my best to remove my son from as a child. Many of the things his father and I have heard from him, regarding her life and her situation-school/work/life- have shown red flags for us.\nNow; Our son was to start schooling soon for a particular career that is very lucrative within time. He wants to follow in his dad\u2019s footsteps. She knows all of this. She recently started quitting all things that pertained to bettering her future. Makes comments that she wants to be a SAHM. Just a few red flags for his dad and I. Things he doesn\u2019t seem to pick up. Also to note- he has a preschool aged sibling that came after 15 years of being an only child. He loves his brother but has been adamant about not wanting kids and definitely not anytime soon. So her comment was a big red flag. \nAfter their trip he came back being more impulsive than ever. He started trying to quit one job to go to another. He wanted to change his plan for his future. Everything seemed to be very \u201cright now\u201d for him. \n3 days ago my world came to a shuttering halt with 3 words. She is pregnant. \nNow my first thought was wtf and are you serious? That turned to, how is that possible. You\u2019ve only been home for less than 2 weeks. Timeline just didn\u2019t add up in mine or his dad\u2019s brain.

But it\u2019s not and so it was. After the math of that, it is possible and lines up with a malfunction with contraceptive. An emergency contraceptive was taken but clearly didn\u2019t work. Come to find out she quit her birth control a couple months back prior to him coming, which wtf. \nReminder- she lives 1600 miles away.\nAccording to our son, she doesn\u2019t have a great support system but a select few family have shown interest in her pregnancy announcement. And yes, she told all of her friends and family despite being 5 seconds pregnant and like 4 weeks along if that. \nThey originally had talked about her moving this way prior to this. Now she wants to stay there and just commute for now but eventually she wants him there. We did our research and in her state, the law does not consider signing a birth certificate as legal rights for the father. He must establish paternity via dna testing to have the same rights as the mother in an unwed couple. She got offended by us telling him this and I told him, we do not know this girl. And TBH, he barely knows her. He spends a little over a week with her and she\u2019s pregnant. \nI\u2019m feeling so resentful right now and I have a JNMIL, so I truly do not want to be like that. But this, I\u2019m struggling. Hes not speaking up and he\u2019s letting her just make all of the decisions despite this also affecting his future and his life too. \nAny advice or suggestions or anything. And please be kind bc I\u2019m really not in the right space to bite my tongue.",

        "content": "To preface this, I think all M/F couples (who are able) should have the M part of the equation get a vasectomy when they are done having kids. I am a primary care doctor, and the burden of birth control has always been way too reliant on the female side. OCPs, IUDs, implants, etc. I've seen multiple tubal ligations (I don't do them), and they are WAY more invasive than vasectomies (for which, I have done many). I consistently counsel my patients on this, and it definitely does irk me when a man is against having a vasectomy for any reason that equates to the fact that they are scared.\n\nMy wife pushed out TWO babies, plus had to get several D&C's in between due to multiple miscarriages. She was (and is) a warrior, who I am in awe of. I did everything I could to make her comfortable after all of these things.\n\nSo when we agreed that we were done having kids, I immediately scheduled my vasectomy. The procedure is so easy, and I barely felt anything. But I obviously had soreness the night after and the next day. However, after all of what she went through, a vasectomy felt like the literal least I could do.\n\nThe part that I thought was pretty funny was that I initially scheduled it when I figured my oldest would be at school the following day, the youngest would be at the nanny's place, and my wife would be at work. So I could have the day to sit on the couch, watch TV, and put ice on my balls. \n\nBut...school got cancelled for the oldest due to the cold, so he would be home. Ok, that's fine. But then, the oldest came into our room at around 11pm the night before saying he didn't feel good, and turns out he had a fever of 102F. Gave him acetaminophen and he went to sleep okay. But, not enough room in the bed, so, I had to go sleep on the couch. Then in the morning, could not take the youngest to the nanny's due to the fever in his brother. So my day alone was done for.\n\nI am very cognizant of the fact that women have to go through hell and then immediately care for a baby. I was very present and active for all of that. I just thought this was a funny story of the things that pop-up during parenting, and wanted to share.",

        "content": "A bit of background - when I was young and unmedicated, my gf at the time told me she was on birth control and became pregnant. I stuck around, working my ass off to pay the bills and she took off with my daughter and moved back to her parents place, about 2 hours away from where we lived. \n\nFast forward to today, my daughter is 11 years old and I see her every other weekend. Her mom doesn\u2019t work, lives with her father, and is the primary parent of another daughter, which led to the circumstances of me being a \u201cweekend dad\u201d. I work my ass off, and can\u2019t seem to make headway with owning a home or earning enough to put even a little bit away in savings. \n\nI recently moved overseas with my wife as she is from another country - some of you may not understand my decision, and believe me, it wasn\u2019t made easily. Our opportunities are greater in her home country - the 5 year plan is to work as hard as we can, own a home in her home country and work towards buying a home in my home country. \n\nWe are working towards jobs that can be done remotely so we can eventually visit for 2-3 months at a time. The long term plan of this is for my daughter as well, when she gets older it will provide her a place to live while studying and a home base for my wife and I while we visit. \n\nWe plan on FaceTiming my daughter 2x a week and having her and my parent fly over for 4-5 weeks at a time. I\u2019m hoping we can swing one or both of us flying over for 2-3 weeks at a time so she can be with us - we can take her to school, be a part of her daily life. (There\u2019s obviously a bit cost involved with this which is why we\u2019re working towards buying a home and renting it out when we aren\u2019t there.)\n\nI guess I\u2019m looking for advice from those currently going through bit gaps of seeing their kids in person. Our hope is that the longer visits will give us more quality time with her, something I feel like we don\u2019t currently get. \n\nIs anyone going through something similar, or did anyone grow up with a parent abroad?",

Moving overseas is a big decision, but it seems like you have a solid plan in place to maintain a strong relationship with your daughter.

        "content": "In short since this is so long, 14 year old, sneaking out, having sex, skipping school, drinking, and getting high.(please read for more context) \n\nOkay this is a doozy and thank you in advance... We're having major problems with out youngest. I'm really just venting a bit, but maybe someone will have a suggestion that I haven't tried yet. \n\nA bit of History:\nWe have 3 kids(18m, 17f, & 14f), and love them all to death and have a very open relationship with them, they tell us everything! Good, bad, whatever, they know we'll do our best to help them as much as possible. They learned at a young age if they did something bad, it was better to come clean and not put it off or lie about it(2-3 day being grounded vs 2-3 weeks). We're pretty relaxed parents we think, we only ask they do their best in school, keep up on homework, do one chore a night, let us know if they're going out and where they'll be(we trust them), and to be honest with us. We don't feel we ask too much from them. \n\nThe 2 oldest have been doing GREAT! Son's got good grades, graduating Highschool this year and has been working the same job for the past 2 year. Daughter has great also, great grades, just finished Driver's Ed, and is only missing 3 credits from graduating early(but wants to wait to graduate with her friends and do vo-tech half the days next year). And both plan on going to college. I really don't think I could have it easier with those two! \n\nNow for the drama mama and where we're running into the major problems... And just to be clear since I'll be mentioning grounding quite a bit in this post, when we ground them, it could range from not going to friends to fully locking down their phones so they can only call mom, dad, brother, and sister and access their alarm clock. She's 14, in her freshmen year of Highschool. The problems really started toward the middle and end of 8th grade. First she got in a fight and ended up in suspended and in court at the middle of 8th grade, then she was caught with a THC VAPE and got in trouble and back in court(thank God we already were off probation from the fight). We went thru the whole court deal and got grounded until she earned out trust back, and all said and done, felt like she learned her lesson. Fast forward to the start of High School, the punk actually had the nerve to skip the first 2 days of school(while still finishing the court ordered probation classes and service from the vape). As pissed as I was, I chalked it up to teens being teens, sat her down explained she just ate up 2 of her \"unexcused absents\" for this semester and explained if she got 5 more, she wouldn't get credit for this semester classes and grounded her for 2 weeks. \n\nThought that would be the end of it and oh boy does it start ramping up... \n\nNext thing I know she's got a \"boyfriend\" and hanging out with a new group of people... I use \"quote\" because we won't let her date until we go on her first date with her(example:diner we'd sit at a different table, movie we'd sit away from her) nothing major or embarrassing. Next thing we know we're getting calls from the school, \"your child missed the following hours\" almost daily and 2-3 classes at a time... Of course, grounded her, but this time I decided to drug test her and it came back positive for marijuana and alcohol... At this point I'm livid... We grounded her for 3 months and told her she wouldn't be allowed to hang out with this ground anymore because it was where she was getting everything from and doing it with. And let me know her know we'd be testing her 1-2 times a week and when she could pass the drug tests for 3 months straight, then we'd ungrounded her. \n\nWell apparently she didn't like that. She called CPS and told them me and my wife were abusing/hitting her... The case was closed the same day we talked with the CPS Workers.\n\nFast forward to 3 months into Highschool: She has yet to pass a single drug test and still getting calls about missed classes(all robo-calls, a real person from the school hasn't called and hasn't called me back)... So still grounded and still lying about skipping classes... Next thing we know, we wake up and she's missing... She had snuck out and went to her boyfriend house. Thankfully our 17 year old daughter knew where he lived and had his number. Of course he denied her being there, but we ended up calling the police and thankfully they brought her back home. Somethings were relayed to use by the police that in turn prompted use to have her put on birth control asap... Quite heart breaking on my end... \n\nFast Forward Again to today(2 days away from the first semester ending:\nWell about a month and a have before this point, she called CPS AGAIN! This time she told them that my wife was doing cocaine in front of her... Of course they called us almost instantly to schedule a home visit, and that same day me and the wife went straight up to the doctors and had ourselves drug tested to show to the case workers. They took one look at our file and didn't even look at our drug tests and asked what was going on, we explained and they closed the case once again since they could see this was turning into a repeating deal and being around 4 times now(with the fight at school, thc vape pen, one false call, and now this cocaine accusation...) \n\nHad been in contact with the school at this point FINALLY. She had managed to rack up 9 absences in all but 2 classes. I'm not sure how, but we managed at that point to get her in a program where if she didn't have anymore missed classes for the next 4 weeks, she would get credit. She's actually been going to class. GOOD! But at this point she's snuck out about 6 more times that we know of(I've actually changed my sleeping habits to stay up until 3am, while my wife wakes up at 4am for work), hasn't passed a drug test, found out she was using fake pee to pass her court drug tests, and has started sneaking out during the one hour we're both asleep, then coming back while we're both at work in the morning... And to find out, her boyfriend bought her a phone and was hiding it from us... \nMy wife's to the point where she's at her wits end and she let's has me handle all parenting since my daughter will fight her tooth to nail and say outright horrible things to her. \n\nSorry for this being such a LONG post! I'm about to the point of taking her out of school since I know all of the skipping is going to start back up with the next semester and home schooling her. But then she really won't get any social interaction, and I really don't want that. And my wife's about to the point of looking into teen residential care. But any suggestions are welcome.",

        "content": "We're both 36, and have a 6 y/o, a 2 y/o, and a 4 week old. My wife had her tubes removed (for birth control and to reduce her chance of ovarian cancer. This was her idea and at the hospital she consented to it obviously. To be fair she was in labor at the time) in conjunction with the c section on this one, so this is a mostly theoretical discussion. She strongly regrets that decision now. She has seriously raised the possibility of doing ivf even though in the past she has been adamant that she would never do ivf because of all the side effects. \n\nI argue that logistically having 3 is a lot easier than 4 (we fit 3 car seats in the back seat of our Camry and our family is all over the world, so travel with 3 is easier/cheaper than 4. Plus we like to travel for leisure so that's a factor too). I know that's not the most convincing argument. I just feel saturated with 3. Our first two are extremely high maintenance. Luckily so far the newborn is a much easier baby than either of them were. And yeah I enjoy them when they're not newborns/infants more. Not saying I don't like the baby stage, but when they're a little interactive and independent it opens up a lot more possibilities (and challenges). I know that going from 3 to 4 isn't a dramatic change in how much time/attention you can give to each but I feel it's non trivial. Bottom line is I'm pretty set on holding at 3 and she wants 1 more (only 1 she says). \n\nFor background we both come from families of 5. We've never had a miscarriage and are extremely fortunate to not have significant medical problems so far with any of our kids. My older brother was born with cerebral palsy and is deaf and crippled, so I have some firsthand experience with what could be. That said my wife is much more on the worrying end of the spectrum all through pregnancy and childhood every time there's a possibility of something being wrong she worries, disproportionately to the actual risk IMO. Before we got together we discussed having kids in general terms, like we both wanted multiple kids, but we didn't get into numbers. \n\nNot sure I have a specific question, but I'm sure there's folks with similar experiences on here. How did it work out when there's a disagreement about the quantity of kids. Is this something that fades or does it build resentment? How can I better handle this? \n\nThanks in advance for any insights.",

They were basically the same hight nd weight, B was just a tad bigger. \n\nNow I am NOT seeking medical advice. I just want to rant about how I feel. \nI have referrals and drs scheduled, but of course specialists take time to get into in USA. \n\nSince a couple weeks after bringing them home I noticed that B was struggling with a few milestones. He was gaining weight beautifully and growing like a weed. We were more concerned with A who was struggling with milk based formula and lack of weight gain at the time. But where A and their older siblings would start to track and focus with what they were seeing B really struggled. B had the vision of a day old at 1 month it seemed like. B startled at the smallest things. We thought that B would most likely need glasses as an older sibling J just found out that they needed glasses.\n\nBut then B started to zone out, lights are on nobody is home, and I have to bring him back to reality by touching him or a loud sound startles him. B doesn\u2019t jerk around or move while in these zoning out episodes. But I knew in my gut at 2 months old B needs to see a neurologist. It took me 2 months to show their pediatrician what is going on to get the referral.\n\nA month ago I had a major breakdown and was sobbing in the living room because I know B has something going on, but I feel like I look like a hypochondriac for my kids, at first it was A who was struggling, but we got his tummy issues under control and for the most part they are non existent anymore. now it is B who i can not label what is going on. I have all the warning bells going off, all the flags raised for myself, yet when i try to talk about it to others i feel like I went and googled 1 symptom and now believe B has cancer. which i do not believe that. my instinct says seizures, but he doesn't convulse with it. ONCE AGAIN I AM NOT ASKING FOR MEDICAL ADVICE I AM JUST VENTING MY FRUSTRATION.\n\nMy husband works 50h weeks and had zero paternity leave so immediately back to work he went. So he doesn\u2019t see as much as I do and is concerned, but has asked if I\u2019m freaking myself out a little. Other family members have voiced that im over reacting and that i need to get some time away from the kids and relax. \n\nfrom experience with my older kids, i know i cant just go walk into my childrens hospital and go something is wrong with my kid, find out what and have them move mountians for B with barely anything more than my intuition. i have to catch what i see on video and jump through the hoops of Americas health care system. I know i also cant just drop everything and go fight full force right now and only focus on Twin B, i have other children who need me too. \n\nSo short version: I know something is going on with Twin B but I have very little proof, and I am starting to feel like I\u2019m crazy for thinking that it is something more than he is just bored. \n\nIf you read it all thank you \u2764\ufe0f\ufffcI\u2019m not looking for medical advice, I just wanted to rant.",

She has recently turned four and is 23.6kg and is 108cm tall.

With my older daughter I have always followed the line of \"offer healthy food, let the child decide what and how much.' \n\nWhen looking for any success people have had, I can only see the typical \"oh we removed juice, soft drinks, chips etc\" and of course the healthier diet improved things with time.

Need help with setting rules/boundaries for the first while. \n\nOk sorry for the long post! Basic background is my children\u2019s (M 2yo, F 3yo, and M 6yo) father has never been involved in our lives. He has basically been more of a sperm donor than anything else over the years. We do not have a relationship, there\u2019s no hard feelings (or any feelings at all on either of our ends) and him not being involved was entirely his choice. I have never asked him for anything, including child support because having the kids was my choice not his. And yes every child was conceived using different forms of birth control, we just got super lucky. And yes he did get a vasectomy after the last one. \n\nLast month there was a lot of drama in his life involving a long term GF he was cheating on, and I was dragged into it (to verify facts for the gf nothing else). Either way it kind of changed the way baby daddy and I communicate, however so far it seems to be for the better strangely?

We aren\u2019t going to discuss custody or anything heavy like that, it\u2019s just going to be about how to build his relationship with the children. \n\nI\u2019m happy he\u2019s ready for this step finally, but I need help and advice on setting boundaries for the first little while while the relationship is building between him and the kids, I want it to be as easy on him and the kids as possible, as well as myself. I\u2019m scared of him coming in and just falling into the roll of \u201cweekend dad\u201d or \u201cDisneyland dad\u201d and I don\u2019t want that for either of us. We will be taking everything super slow and will probably meet a couple times before he ever gets introduced to the kids, but yeah. \n\nI just\u2026 I want advice on what I should be prepared for I think? I feel like there\u2019s so much I\u2019m not thinking of that I should talk with him about, and I don\u2019t want to miss anything. Anybody have any advice?",

In terms of boundaries, I made it clear that stepping back into his life was not to be taken lightly, and if he was going to be wishy washy then it was better to just not be involved at all. He had some demons that he had to fight on his own. \n\nThey just kind of took to each other on their own time. It took time for his father to learn about him, his likes and dislikes, his little idiosyncrasies etc. My son calls him dad and Mr. [Name], and I don\u2019t pressure him either way.

        "content": "Went to a doctor appointment for our 16yo (lets say Ashley again) and the experience was...not great.\n\nI am not the bio mom. Her dad and I are engaged, and Ashley is currently living with us. I have taken Ashley to many appointments in the past, but her previous doctor moved (who I absolutely loved), and this was my first time meeting this doctor and nurse. Mom has met this doctor once last year to get established.\n\nWe go in, talk with the nurse, and explain why we are there (sti/std/pregnancy testing). While she's typing the nurse asks, \"And how are you related to Ashley?\" I let her know I'm dad's fiance and my name. She puts this in, asking how it's written.\n\nDoctor comes in and introduces herself. I let her know my name as well. She then says, \"so are you just hanging out?\" Confused by such a question and having no response, the only thing I muster was, \"huh?\"\n\nAfter several seconds of silence, she says, \"well you're not mom, right?\" I say no and let her know my relation. \"Okay! Because looking at you (points between Ashley and I), you don't match\" and chuckles at herself.\n\nWe continue the appointment. We get to the topic of birth control, and why Ashley is no longer on it. I let the doctor know that Ashley was taken off the pill because of the interactions with other medications her psychiatrist has her on. She gives me an odd look, asks what the problem is, I explain, and Ashley adds that when all the medication changes were happening we removed any unnecessary meds to get a better baseline. (This was when needing to be tapered off a few things while having others increased.)\n\nThe doctor states that \"Ashley really should be on birth control\", and if estrogen is the problem, then she would to do the depo shot. I tell her that due to the effects on the bones, I've actually had a few obgyns tell me that they do not suggest this to even adults anymore, so I wouldn't personally be comfortable with our teenager getting it. She responds, \"well I don't agree with that, but that's okay I guess\" and then asks about an implant to which Ashley says she's not sure she would want. Doctor states she'll speak with the psychiatrist to find out why birth control is a problem and what options are available.\n\nThe rest of the visit was alright, but those few things bothered me. None of it was necessarily bad, but the way she went about it definitely could have been better. I have two bio children that don't really \"match\" me and people say got nothing from me and look just like my fiance. I feel asking Ashley to make sure she wants birth control again would be better than just telling her. Offering some information or resouces on implants would be good too since she wasn't sure. Putting teenagers on depo is not what I would do personally, but oh well.\n\nETA: We talked about what Ashley was comfortable with prior to the appointment, so I went in. I don't disagree with her being on birth control in general.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Honestly, it sound like at the beginning the doctor was trying to give you an opportunity to exit the exam room. Most 16 year olds no longer require a parent (or parent figure) to attend their appointments, *especially* one focused on their sexual activity. \n\nI imagine she was also put off by the fact that you were the one answering all the questions. Ashley really should have taken the lead on this one, it's her reproductive health. It's more understandable if Ashley has anxiety issues that make it difficult for her to speak up in these situations, but even in that case you can't really blame the doctor for being taken aback by the fact that her patients not-quite-step-mom was answering for her. \n\nAs for the birth control... The doctor is right. If Ashley is sexually active she should be on some form of birth control. You told the doctor the psychiatrist took Ashley off birth control, so Ashley's primary care provider getting in touch with the psychiatrist to get on the same page actually sounds like good quality care. \n\nAnd at the end of it all... It doesn't matter what you think of the doctor. It's not your doctor. It's your fiance's daughter's doctor. If Ashley is happy with her, maybe this is an opportunity for you to step back from being in charge of Ashley's doctors appointments. She's 16, and this is something she needs to learn how to navigate without your input.",

We have 3 children, our eldest is an almost 7 year old boy, our second is a 3.5 year old boy, and we have a 4 month old baby girl. \n\nIt was a conscious decision for us to start growing our family as soon as we got married. We discussed it thoroughly, from how many kids we wanted up to specifics of paternity leaves and logistics of caring for a newborn. We even talked about pumping and did research on it during our engagement so my husband can handle feedings. I also got off birth control a few months before the wedding. We planned it and wanted it and were excited by it.\n\nOur eldest is a honeymoon baby. And our next two children were evenly spaced out, about 3 year gap between each child. \n\nAbout 1.5 months ago, we found out that we conceived again when I was just about 6-7 weeks postpartum. It was a shock but once that settled in, it became a very happy surprise for us. No one knows about our 4th yet.\n\nEveryone has always been happy and supportive about our announcements and I am sure we will get the same with this one  but from our very first pregnancy, people- even the good people we know- have been poking fun at it. \n\nFrom comments like \u201cI see you never left the room during your honeymoon\u201d and \u201cletting me pee was probably the only time I got rest\u201d to \u201cit is just me or are you always pregnant?\u201d and \u201coh my god, get off of her\u201d they\u2019re always said it a lighthearted, funny way and I know these people don\u2019t have any bad intentions behind the jokes.\n\nBut I feel like since this pregnancy came too soon, the jokes will intensify and I might be a little more sensitive about it since we actually didn\u2019t plan this one. I told my husband about it and he said he\u2019ll handle the comments and shut them down if they come. But my husband can be kind of intimidating for others and I don\u2019t want him scaring people and tying that memory to our announcement.\n\nFor context, I\u2019m Asian and my husband is half Asian and half white so culturally, calling people out can be kind of tricky and can quickly cause drama.\n\nAlso, we\u2019re announcing maybe early December and since it is the holidays, more people will be around which could mean more comments and I\u2019m not looking forward to it. I would wait until after New year\u2019s but they would probably start noticing so since it looks like I\u2019m going to be showing sooner than with our previous babies and we want to get ahead of it.",

        "content": "Hello everyone. I'm new to r/parents and wondering if anyone has experienced this issue with their young one. Sorry for long post, hard to tldr. \n\nOur soon to be 4 year old (in 1 month) has been having some growing issues around being argumentative over many things (lately every little thing). He will disagree with any food or any place that we need to go. This is also the case with many other topics. Talking about it (whatever his current issue) doesn't change the attitude or his refusals, and if it happens anyway he will cry and try tantrums. His listening has also dropped off, where he just ignores us and we are having to put a lot of energy into getting him to listen. He also has been crying a lot more over little things that previously never bothered him.\n\nExample, we are out walking and he will run ahead. We will tell him he can go ahead a bit but if hears us say 'stop' then he needs to listen and be a good boy. He will agree and we will even discuss why (safety), and then 30 seconds later he is running ahead ignoring us. If we remind him to listen it's then arguing (yeah but I wanted this, yeah but I wanted to go that). We will have the \"no but's\" discussion but to get him to listen again we need to up the intensity emotionally or introduce threats of punishment for not listening. This then morphs into crying or tantrums where we can't get him to take responsibility for his behaviour that he just said he would/wouldn't do. \n\nFor context, my wife and I notice this behaviour is much more pronounced when he is tired or sick, and has been gearing up more so in general since birth of baby sister 2 months ago. We are trying to keep our patience and feel like it's due to the change of a new sister, but we're not certain how to proceed. We feel like he is trying to establish some control, but the behaviour is spreading everywhere and nothing's changing it, it seems to be getting more and more. \n\nWe have tried talking with him when he doesn't want to go out, or eat dinner, etc. about why it is important. This has worked less often, and he will lately just find a new reason to keep the objection going with lots of arguing \"yeah but\". Talking about it or giving him control in small decisions does not seem to lessen the behaviour overall, and he would argue forever. Even getting his way in small ways is just leading to more argument and demanding, he will keep finding problems with every little thing.\n\nWe've also tried the opposite of not arguing and just not engaging with argument, but when it comes to things that must get done it often is required to escalate to reminding him having TV time taken away (so crying and freaking out at that threat which we follow through on). We will tell him when he chooses not to listen he is choosing to not get his TV time, or not get his dessert. So far this has not really changed much regarding behaviour. He is always upset about punishment but when it comes to his listening he just doesn't unless consequences are right in his face then it's kind of 'poor me'. \n\nWe (Mom and I) are both getting exhausted. We are trying to practice compassion and not let anger enter the equation. The flip side is that he is being entirely obstinate at times and is really only listening when he is in big trouble and then it's crying and playing the victim after he has refused to listen after multiple warnings. Obviously he is a little boy so we're trying to own it and feel like we need to change things up a bit, but aren't sure how to proceed. \n\nHoping some veterans out there may have gone through this, any thoughts?",

She spent 6 weeks in the NICU and I was beyond overwhelmed.\nNot long after she came home I got in a roll over accident with my (then) 2 year old in the car. I was a complete wreck because on top of all that their father was becoming more and more distant and unsupportive of me, among other things.\n\nPanic attacks began to control my life and I was put on Xanax. At first it changed everything and I thought I had found the answer to all my problems. Instead, though, addiction to it was creeping up on me. The cycle of needing more and more to control the anxiety, that then would cause more anxiety between doses, spiraled out of control quickly. I started taking more and more and I became less and less myself. Somehow I didn't completely see it. My life began completely falling apart and I became a dissociated shell of the person I was. The circumstances with their father contributed heavily to this, a lot of trauma there. \nEverything came to a head with DCS investigating me for neglect and I landed in jail for 12 hours. My daughter got hurt climbing on a toy with wheels and to be fair I wasn't being a very good mom. They were cared for but I wasn't present and I was just going through the motions. I had lost myself all the way. I had a seizure on that dirty jail floor from withdrawals and I knew right then and there that enough was enough. I admitted myself into a psych ward for detox the next week. \n\nFast forward 13 months and here I am today. I'm trying to pick all the pieces up and in some ways I've made leaps and bounds. Sometimes I even start to recognize myself again. But again, I am completely overwhelmed. My 2 year old is on a feeding tube now and it is so much work. I don't have any help. My oldest is having behavioral problems (I played a huge part in that) and my 5 year old is anxious.\nI took my hands off the wheel through that brief addiction and tried to rely on their father and my mother as much as I could which I see now was a huge mistake. So many things have been done and taught that I would never have allowed myself if I had been there mentally.\nThe guilt and shame I feel is constant and I'm drowning in it. I'm afraid to talk about it with people because I am now afraid of DCS. I can see now looking back that I caused so many problems by self medicating. I also have a constant fear now of my children dying from random tragedies. Car accidents, cancer, school shootings. It invades every thought and I've even started regretting it when I let them go places, which is not good and I know I've got to just learn to recognize when things are out of my control.\n\nI don't know what to do to fix everything I've screwed up. I feel like I've recovered quite a bit of the bond with my younger 2 children in this last year but my 10 year old son is extremely distant from me sometimes, and I can't blame him.\nI think about how close we were the first 5 years of his life, we never even spent one night apart until he was 5. It completely destroys me and makes me feel devastated when I think of that and when I think of what could be different if I had never allowed things to go so wrong.\n\nI feel like the worst mother in the world and I don't know if I will EVER make up for what has happened. The damage is done and I don't know how to fix things when I've barely put myself back together. How does one move forward from here?",

I\u2019m worried his mum would take her eyes off of my daughter and she\u2019d be upstairs grabbing at things she shouldn\u2019t - my husband had said he\u2019ll be extremely firm in telling his sister to be responsible and not keep things out (and she would never do anything to harm her) \n\nI\u2019m also very controlling (not in the negative way) I just like things done in a certain way, find it hard to let go I guess. \n\nCan anyone relate?

        "most_upvoted_comment": "It's really thoughtful of you to want to help your child navigate this. I lost my father when I was 10 although in different circumstances. The death of a parent is really hard and never goes away. I would say the biggest thing is your son will likely be curious about who his dad was. I also think the fact that no matter how imperfect he was his dad loved him with all his heart is really important information to share with your son. I would suggest making a scrap book filled with pictures and mementos of your ex before he lost his battle to his addiction, including writing out happy memories you have of him. Things like how you met, what attracted you to him (PG version, obviously), how your ex reacted when your son was born, happy memories of them when he was a baby, etc. If you can do it, I would add a family tree with pictures of his relatives from that side. If you can get in touch with parents and get stories and photos from your ex's childhood your son would really treasure that. If your ex has any cool accomplishments (no matter how minor) include those too. Your son will want to find a reason to be proud of his dad and potentially find similarities between them as he reaches certain life milestones. If your ex is willing, see if he can write a letter to his son letting him know how much he loves him and is proud of him. Obviously it will still hurt and be terrible but knowing his dad loved him will help long term.",

I don\u2019t want to talk about the breakup too much but in short it was a terrible breakup and we both did some horrible things once we were broken up. We got back together not long after and it\u2019s been really rocky still.

We\u2019ve told eachother before hand if we ever got pregnant that we would ultimately abort it. Now that\u2019s it\u2019s actually happening she is having second thoughts. She really wants to keep it but she understands we made a promise and she will go through with the abortion even though she doesn\u2019t nt want to. I honestly don\u2019t want to get rid of it either but now is the best time while it\u2019s so early on and we are definitely not ready for many reasons: finances, we\u2019re still in college, immature and stupid, our relationship is rocky, our mental health has also been really bad lately. She thinks that having a kid is going to give her purpose in life. I feel like this is a red flag? thinking that a child will solve all her depression issues and not rely on me so much (she\u2019s really emotionally attached to me and her world revolves around me). She\u2019s claimed before the pregnancy that if I leave she will kill herself because she won\u2019t have purpose in this life anymore. Personaly don\u2019t think we should bring a child into this world.\n\nThe way she got pregnant was also a mistake (obviously). We\u2019ve never really used protection during our three years together. She has problems that make it really difficult to get pregnant according to a doctor and she has been on birth control too. She forgot to take some pills a few weeks ago and now she\u2019s pregnant. We confirmed she was by taking 3 pregnancy tests. I understand I have some responsibility too but ultimately she got pregnant because she forgot to take the pills. \n\nThere\u2019s a side of me that wants to keep this kid but I think we\u2019re making the best decision not keeping it right now. If this was later on when we have things figured out then I would want to keep it of course. However in the state we\u2019re in I don\u2019t think we are ready at all. \n\nI feel really guilty too for getting rid of this potential life. I know all the people in our lives will be supportive but I really think me and her should wait. We have so many things to work on and I know if we wait we could possibly provide a way better future for our kids.

This is about my 4 year old I will call \"L\"\n\n\"L\" does not have calm energy, she cannot sit still, has sensory issues, and several other indicators as well, I personally feel she needs to be evaluated for neurodivergence. I've brought up evaluation to her pediatrician at her 3 past visits but the pediatrician doesn't do or recommend anything, she just basically ignores my concerns because she's not school aged and I also think it's because she's not a boy showing these same symptoms. She has melt downs and I don't know how to teach her self control. We try to practice breathing, we try distraction, we try counting to 10, we try removing over-stimulating items, we have tried time outs to help her calm down, we have tried almost everything to teach her to regulate herself. (We do not spank or use physical punishment, so please don't suggest an ass whooping)\n\nWell my BIL brought home a 7 week old puppy yesterday. The puppy is timid and shy and little, we are having to keep L separate from the puppy because L has such overwhelming energy. It feels like she is physically incapable of sitting still and she keeps scaring the puppy. I feel terrible because it's new and exciting and normal for L's age group to be stoked about a puppy. There is a gated area where the puppy is staying but L just leans on the gate and keeps yelling and clapping her hands trying to get the puppy to come to her. It's now to the point where I am sitting in my bedroom for the last 2 hours with L because she can't calm down, she's having a complete melt down and yelling and crying and sobbing that she wants the puppy, but I clearly can't take her out to the puppy when she's like this. Me being due in 1 week is making me feel super stressed and I'm struggling to handle this situation to be honest. She has been allowed to pet and touch the puppy several times but they can't be just loose together.\n\nBasically all of this is to ask advise on how to teach L to calm her energy down, so she CAN sit still and be in control for enough time to play with the puppy without overwhelming the little thing. She's not violent, she's just very in your face excited about everything at all times, bouncing and spinning and clapping, squealing and screeching. Everything I've googled about how to teach a young child to be calm is about calming down anger outbursts, which isn't the problem. She's a very good child, she's just always 100% energy 100% of the time, and I need to know different ways to teach her how to reign it in so she doesn't have to miss out. I want her to experience everything she wants to experience but some situations are just too much for her and I'd like to help her. It's also making me a little nervous for when the new baby gets here and there's *another* new experience for her. I know the baby will get used to her, but he's going to be woken up every 10 minutes if I can't help her.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience or advise on methods I could try? Is this just something she's going to have to miss out on until she's older or I have professional help for her? (I really don't want that, I'd like to be able to help her now) I want her to have the best experiences and at this point she just can't cause she's too much.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "1. If at all possible, the puppy needs to be removed from this situation. I'm sorry, but sometimes some pets and people are not good fits. Personality wise they're a bad match, and the way she's trying to interact tells me that she doesn't comprehend the puppy is a living creature, not a toy, yet. She's not emotionally mature enough to for the puppy to be exposed to her. 7 weeks is really too early for a puppy to be away from it's mother in the first place, but that's a different conversation. \n\n2) If possible, different pediatrician and get her evaluated like now. Waiting until school age to address behavioral issues is rediculous and probably detrimental to her and your family. \n\n3) Modeling could help if this is a learned behavior, but it doesn't sound like it is. In that case I would suggest finding an energy draining activity for her. Pee wee soccer, a trampoline in the backyard, a playgroup, something. Outlets to regularly get her energy out and be as loud/energetic as she wants can go a long way to helping her self-regulate. \n\nThis sounds really hard, so hugs. I hope this helps.",

The older me is thinking I let him get away Scott\u2019s free without any responsibility but then the money would have conferred benefits onto him which at the time I wouldn\u2019t want him to have being a young mother.  But I detest him these days these feelings are coming out of nowhere when clearly once upon a time I was really happy not having him anywhere near her. I feel awful for my daughter that in hindsight her father has abandoned her no matter what the situation was between me and him and me expressing he can\u2019t have pictures or contact her any more. After his remarriage he never fought for her never fought for visitation rights nothing! I get to be mad for my daughters sake right ? I mean the contact I stopped him from\nWas not even legally binding. I want to tell her about cousins she has aunts and uncles she knows nothing of but should I be when her father  clearly wasn\u2019t no relation with her.. what shall I mention about her dad if anything ?? His name his occupation his job?!! She is 11 her father is on her birth certificate it can\u2019t be avoided for ever! I. Need some guidance please",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Are you saying the only time you have told your daughter about her bio dad is during an argument? That\u2019s really problematic. She needs to know the truth and quickly. \n\nGenerally, the best approach is to give the child the basic information. Then let them ask as many (or as few) questions as they want, and answer those questions as honestly as you can. She will probably need some time to process, so you may find it takes a year or two of many conversations where she asks a little more each time. \n\nExpect her to have a *lot* of big feelings about this. Some of which will likely be anger with you. \n\nPut your own feelings about her dad aside. This isn\u2019t about you, it\u2019s about your daughter, and you\u2019re not blameless in the way things turned out. Let it go.\n\nLet her have her own big feelings about him, which will likely change a lot as she processes everything.",

I've known my partner for 24 years he has 5 kids from 14 to 9,and we have two together 2 and 5 months, we dated on/off in high school. Always maintained a close friendship that both our ex's were very aware of.\n   I helped him get his kids back when his ex got them taken away (long story). We then started living together after finding ourselves single ( after discussing it with his 5 kids). We had our daughter, then moved to another state. Now when we moved we included his two step kids from his first marriage (he  raised them as his own and it wasn't right to separate them from their siblings) and their mother( who I've known for 16 years) his ex. So she's the mom of 7 of the kids in the house, I'm the mom of the two youngest. \n She brags about how we're one big happy family, yet bashes everything I do. My partner tries his best to put his foot down to stop her bull shit but she twists it so that to the kids he's the douchebag being mean to Mommy. She thinks I dont remember that her house always looked disgusting until my partner started datong her yet she rips my cleaning  to pieces.Her name is M. She rewards the kids for basically reporting to her if I get angry at something or don't do what she thinks I should be doing.She's taken the three rooms she has to herself and crammed 7 animals in them ( 2 dogs, 2 cats, 2 guineas, and a bearded dragon), her space smells like animal piss and unwashed bodies because she doesnt shower or change her clothes, the kids are now doing that. She has MS, can walk, can do things like a normal person but, stays locked in her bedroom all day so the kids have to fight to get into her bedroom to spend time with her ( the boys have actually hit each other over who is spending time with mom). She locks her doors and only one of her kids has the keys to it (not the adults). M will promise them thinga but never follow through.  She also doesn't work or contribute but demands seprate food and drinks, plus cigarettes.\n This women stays in her room all day but comes out to scream at the kids because she doesn't like how the dad and I run the house (she hates me). God I can go on and on about the psychological and emotional damage she does to her kids.  If the kids and I have a good time M will treat the like shit for a week. She's recently bought my babies a bunch if stuff but nothing for her own, which bothers the shit out of me.\n   The reason she came with us is because I'm a damn doormat and I felt bad that the kids would be missing their mom, plus she has MS, I don't/didn't want her to be alone and suffering through that. But it's come back and bitten me in the ass. I have panic attacks whenever I have to come back to the house or the rare occasion she comes out of her room.  My life is a nightmare. I'm miserable and regret joining this family. I love his kids so much and would rip to shreds anyone that dares touch them but, I'm at a loss here. \n    If we kick her out we risk losing his step sons who he absolutely adores and he doesn't want his kids thinking we tossed out their disabled mom(she's not disabled (I know she will be sometime in the future though) but tells the kids she is)\nEdit: For those commenting on me having two kids. I was told at 19 and again at 25, I could NOT have children.

We split because he wanted more children after the one-year-old we already have, and I didn't want any more kids. The split ended up being way messier than it should have been since the issue wasn't with each other but our life paths, but he ended up not speaking to me for days and not wanting to see his daughter over this whole issue before finally showing up, grabbing his stuff, and basically telling me that this wasn't going to work. Not going to go into the legal stuff but basically I haven't spoken to him in a week again, since the split he has been coming once a week to see his daughter for like 2 hours.\r  \n\r  \nSo a few days ago I went to get my IUD inserted. After my daughter's birth I didn't go back on birth control (depo shot), but we were consistently using condoms because I was adamant I did not want to get pregnant again while I was on the waiting list for an IUD. So I've been waiting 6 months for this appt. and I go to it, and they make you take a pregnancy test beforehand and somehow mine comes back positive. I was shocked, I spent the rest of the day sitting at home crying and eating ice cream and definitely did not tell anyone, but I did take several more tests, and they were all positive, and then I calculated my last period/ovulation and I'm probably 7 weeks along.\r  \n\r  \nSo the next day my ex's mom comes by to see her granddaughter. We have a pretty good relationship, despite what is going on with my ex lately, she has always been very kind to me. So we were talking and I didn't bring it up, but I had told her previously about when my IUD appointment was, so she knew it was the day prior. She asked how it went, and seeing no reason to lie, I told her. She was very receptive and understanding, but I forgot to mention that I hadn't told my ex yet. Considering that he hasn't responded to the last few messages I sent to him asking if he wanted to see our daughter, and considering that I was still confused and startled and flustered, it hadn't been my first thought to tell him right away. I did call him that the morning but there was no response so I didn't push it.\r  \n\r  \nThat evening I was putting my daughter to bed and when I returned to sit down and looked at my phone I had 20 missed calls from him, at least 30 messages, and 3 voice mails. He was swearing at me, calling me a s!ut, calling me pathetic, throwing insults at me, everything in the book because I hadn't told him but I had told his mother. I couldn't even have a conversation with him on the phone because he was so mad at me he ended up just hanging up.\r  \n\r  \nI get that I wasn't right to not tell him first.

I am pregnant with my third and this is a high risk pregnancy. We have gotten ultrasounds every two weeks checking on the growth, im on a ton of medication because of vitamin deficiencies and I'm at risk for pre term delivery. \n\nWe decided not to go public until after the anatomy scan and testing is complete. But we do not plan on announcing the birth date (scheduled csection) at all. The baby will be born and i will be home from the hospital and my girls meet their sibling before social media is posted (due to my second birth I wanted my oldest to meet her and everyone hounded me and started saying something was wrong. No it was a csection during covid, yes she was a NICU baby but still not wrong just wanted my oldest to meet her first). \n\nI swapped hospitals because one of them works at our local one and during covid she got to come in even though I was only allowed my mom and husband. I'm at a specialist for my bariatric condition hospital where my cardiologist, fertility specialist, OBGYN, and bariatric surgeon all have privileges. Its the obvious choice. But I know this decision will piss them off since they all have had to be there for my births and then don't invite me for theirs. They've had a weird thing with my oldest acting like she's theirs and trying to parent her and tell me how to do things.

So my MIL and SILs have blamed me for both in \"keeping it from them\" my therapist says my husband should tell them but if we left it up to him the baby will be a year old by that time. \n\nI was thinking of dropping it in the group chat between me him and his mom.

        "title": "Postpartum depression and anxiety, overeating, and\u2026Wellbutrin?",
        "content": "So my son was born on May 10th and I have been having a VERY hard time with postpartum depression and anxiety since then. I mean, it\u2019s bad. I\u2019ve always had some mental health concerns and I\u2019ve been medicated for them ever since I was 19, but this? I have never experienced a depression this low before. It is absolutely just the worst. There aren\u2019t any words that can scratch the surface of how bad it is for me. This is my second child, and my second c-section birth. \n\nAfter I started getting down to the lowest of the lows that I\u2019ve ever experienced, I unintentionally picked up a nasty habit of overeating and my comfort foods were very specific. They had to be the hostess brand chocolate cupcakes with the swirl in the middle and baked lays, as well as the smuckers brand peanut butter and jelly sandwiches called \u201cUncrustables\u201d and they can only be the strawberry jelly ones. I am going through a family sized box of the cupcakes a day at the very least but usually more. There are 14 individual cakes in the family sized box. I go through a 10-count box of the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches every day too. And I eat at least two big bags (6.25oz I think) of the baked lays chips in a day. That\u2019s a LOT of calories per day for a 30 year old woman who is only 5 feet, 2 inches tall and my weight has been steadily increasing over the past few weeks since I started eating like this. \n\nI know that most people are just going to be like \u201cJust stop buying this stuff then!\u201d And they definitely have a valid point and the best intentions. But they also don\u2019t understand how much of a compulsion this is for me. I have what feels like no control over this at all. I will sit there and delude myself into thinking that it\u2019s just as simple as saying \u201cI just won\u2019t buy any more of these things after I run out of them.\u201d And I have every intention of following through with that. But then I get to the store and I instantly get a terrible craving for them and I get a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach if I pass by them and don\u2019t pick them up and put them in my shopping cart. It\u2019s like I have a magnet in my brain. Even online grocery delivery is useless for me because I will see these items on my \u201cmost purchased\u201d or \u201crecently purchased items\u201d list and then before I know it, I have put five boxes/bags in my virtual cart without even thinking. I have never had this kind of relationship with food before in my life. My husband has been ragging on me about it (the depression AND the eating) every single day and it doesn\u2019t do anything to help me. In fact, it seems to make it worse for me because then I feel even worse about myself which then drives my cravings up through the roof and ultimately pushes me back to my comfort eating habit once again. I didn\u2019t have this problem until the depression got as bad as it is. \n\nToday, I saw a new psychiatrist and I gave her a long and detailed history about my mental health and all of the various treatments and medications that I\u2019ve been on and tried and how they\u2019ve helped or not helped me before. Before my pregnancy, I was on about 6-7 different medications for the several different mental health issues I have. She was a bit worried about the impact of my taking so many medications when I was otherwise a healthy 29 year old woman who had some chronic pain (long history of it) and yes, I was a little overweight, but otherwise mostly healthy. She is mostly concerned about first treating the postpartum depression and anxiety due to the severity of it, but she is definitely also concerned about the overeating problem that I\u2019ve developed because of the very high risk of obesity and other health problems associated with overeating that I have if my habits continue as they are now. She\u2019s hoping that treating the depression and anxiety will solve the eating disorder. \n\nSo she started me on 150mg of Wellbutrin, or generic bupropion. I have taken that medicine in the past to help with my bad case of executive dysfunction (it\u2019s always been a problem for me) and it was also added at that time to supplement my other antidepressants and mood stabilizers. I was on 450mg (max dose) at the time, which I considered to be my therapeutic dose. I felt like it was a good tool for me and that it helped me. Of course, she can\u2019t just throw me right back into the maximum dose of bupropion after I had discontinued it over a year ago, hence why she has me taking 150mg. \n\nThe method of treatment that she wants to use for me is to slowly reintroduce me to the medications that have helped me in the past and to reintroduce each medication one at a time to monitor any potential side effects and also allow her to gradually increase the dosage to a therapeutic level for me before she gets to a point where she is comfortable with adding a new medication to my routine. Of course, this means that I will be seeing her much more often than once every six weeks but I\u2019m okay with that because I know that I am severe enough to where I need to see a professional more than once every six weeks. She wants to see me once a week for the foreseeable future. It\u2019s much easier to do that since we\u2019re strictly doing telemedicine visits. I\u2019m admittedly cautiously optimistic about this. But honestly? I just want to start feeling like myself again, not as if I\u2019m stuck in a bottomless black hole with no way out and no hope of getting back. I also have a new therapist as well so I\u2019m definitely trying my hardest to get better and not just talking a good game about it. I\u2019m really putting in the work to take the necessary steps to help myself.\n\nTo others who have gone through this kind of mental health crisis, how did you manage to get through it and what treatments, if any, worked for you? How long did this process last for you? Bonus points if you also have a history with mental health treatment before pregnancy and childbirth.",

At the time, he was a professional athlete and well off entrepreneur who had full custody of both his ex\u2019s oldest child (not biologically his) and his biological child he had with her. Our separation was amicable - we just didn\u2019t see things the same and were at very different places in life.\n\nI was raised in a very strict, sheltered fundamentalist Christian family so sexual education, protection, birth control, etc. we\u2019re never discussed and it left me somewhat unprepared for the \u201creal world\u201d. And 2 months after breaking up, I found out I was about 3 months pregnant. I informed him and he made it extremely clear that I should have an abortion and didn\u2019t want to be involved at all. \n\nI wasn\u2019t willing to have an abortion so I just didn\u2019t involve him. I didn\u2019t block him or anything in case he wanted to reach out which during my pregnancy he never did. I had L alone and put J on the birth certificate but never put in a child support order or anything. When L was about 8 months, J asked to meet up. I thought it may be the start of him wanting to be involved but it was more of an awkward attempt at a booty call lol and we never heard from him again.\n\nI met my husband T (36M) when L was 2 and they have been attached at the hip ever since. T adopted L when he was 4 and we have 2 other children together (M7, F5). T has just always been daddy, there is no separation between him and our other 2 children.\n\nIn the back of my mind I always knew I would need to tell L the truth but wanted to wait til he could understand. Now that he\u2019s 11 and starting middle school soon, I know I need to do it. I don\u2019t know how much of the truth to divulge? J still lives locally to us and is an easy google search to find. I don\u2019t want my baby to feel like he was unwanted. I\u2019m scared he\u2019ll want to reach out to J and he\u2019ll be ignored and be further hurt by someone he doesn\u2019t even know. I don\u2019t want the relationship between T and our son to change. I know these concerns are centered around my fears and it\u2019s ultimately up to my son about what he wants to do and how he feels about the situation.

She didn't want them to have this baby and wanted them to get a abortion. Both of them said no that they wanted to raise their child together. In this time while the mother to be her own mother/grandmother went for guardianship of her daughter moved her in a apartment and would not allow my son to come there. He still went to all prenatal and doctors appointments with the mother to be. My son and I was at the hospital for birth of his daughter. The maternal grandmother also there making all the decisions, it ended up the mother had to give birth by c-section and the maternal grandmother would no let my son go in with them. After birth the new parents already made the decision what the name was and again grandmother took away the father's last name. The maternal grandmother after birth went for guardianship of the baby and was granted before paternity was established. She now has control of everything and my son has to hire a attorney so he can see his daughter that she refuses to let him be apart of. When the child was 3 she was put in harms way by both mother and grandmother by a sex offender. The children has been taken away from the mother 3 time and now lives with the grandmother. My son now has a attorney and we now surpass 2 years in getting a court date. NOTHING was said to the child that dad is fighting to remove that guardianship and full custody but everyone on the mother side told her and talks badly about the father to the child. Are we in the wrong for the father to have his rights since mother cannot protect and care for the child. Instead of the grandmother who wanted them to have a abortion.

Our 2 year old was a HUGE surprise!! \n\nA little back story- I was married to my first husband, we had our son, and when he was 2 we got off birth control and we were never able to conceive again. Our marriage fell apart when our son was about 8. I met my now boyfriend and we became pregnant over covid. At the time, my clinic was closed,and with all the \"crazy\" that was going on in the world, my birth control shot wasn't on my mind, plus I always felt in the back of my mind that I couldn't get pregnant again, well surprise surprise we had our daughter! She was a shock but she is an absolute joy and we wouldn't trade her for anything! \n\nAll that being said, we truly did NOT want to have anymore children, and this morning I took a test, as I've been feeling nauseous and I was late, it was positive!! \n\nNow comes the reason for the post. This brings me a tremendous amount of anxiety, as well as for my boyfriend. We live in a small 3 bdrm townhouse, and finances are tight. We are just in such a mode of,  how are we going to do this,  how are we going to afford it, Also, I am 38 years old and pretty overweight, which can cause complications, so that brings added anxiety as well. To make matters worse, a close friend of mine,  her daughter was 38, overweight, and pregnant and she and baby passed away very suddenly when she was 35 weeks pregnant due to step b. This has me spiraling with thoughts.  I'm just looking for some encouragement and kind words as all I can keep thinking is, \"I'm to old for this, how are we going to do this\"",

She\u2019s always complaining about her skin feeling dry or being red and sore etc. I myself am a professional makeup artist so I know a thing or 2 when it comes to skincare and I\u2019ve tried all my hacks. To me I think her skins just being put through too much.\nHer mother is taking her to the derm again in 2 weeks and is apparently ready to put her on accutane. I just don\u2019t looooove this idea\u2026 accutane can be super harsh, also my step daughters SUPER nervous about it cuz she did her own research and is also afraid that they have to take a blood sample first etc.\n\nSo my question is, what other routes have worked for people? We\u2019ve tried eliminating gluten etc. I\u2019m just not sure if there\u2019s a better natural way to go first. I\u2019m very anti birth control and accutane.

Because of her diabetes and taking insulin, our newborn barely avoided the NICU as our baby girl's blood sugar was dangerously low at birth. The hospital ended up having us formula feed to get her blood sugar levels under control again. \n\nMy wife has been wanting to fully breastfeed, and the goal is to eventually quit the formula after the pediatrician gives the okay with blood sugar control and weight gain. The problem is now that our baby has been bottle feeding, she is having difficulty latching, will usually just try to nurse a little then back her head away and unlatch, sometimes fall asleep just using my wife as a pacifier. I try to help stimulate the baby from falling asleep such as touching her chin and back, and my wife will try switching sides, but it has not helped. I'm afraid we already have the baby used to bottle feeding and she is not wanting to work for the milk and seems to get frustrated. \n\nWith bottle feeding we try to make sure she is more upright with the bottle perpendicular to have her work for it to better simulate breastfeeding, but it has not helped the situation. I commend my wife for trying, sometimes spending over 30 minutes to hour just working with her to latch, unlatch, feed a little, etc. but ultimately the baby doesn't get the food needed and has to resort back to bottle feeding. My wife has been pumping as often as she can to retain her milk supply, but she ultimately wants to breastfeed the baby without the hassle of bottle feeding. \n\nAny advice to new parents trying to now ween off bottle feeding?

        "title": "No-one needs me",
        "content": "Not quite sure what the point of my post is, i just need to vent. I just feel like such a failure at the moment.\n\nMy twins were born 3 weeks ago and I'd planned to exclusively breast feed. I exclusively breastfed my daughter (who is now 4) absolutely fine right up until she weaned, so assumed I wouldn't have a problem. But we were readmitted to hospital on day 4 as both twins had lost over 12% of their birth weight. Since then I've been combination feeding but my breastmilk still isn't enough for them. They'll have a breastfeed but are still rooting afterwards, like it doesn't fill them up at all. I'm pumping some too but only managing about 50ml a session, so at this stage I'm mainly formula feeding. I just can't face the ammount of time I need to be hooked up to a pump to increase my supply enough. \n\nMy 4yo daughter loves the twins, but will not listen to a single word I say - to the point where I'm physically dressing and putting shoes on for her. She does these things instantly for her dad,whereas I only get listened to when I get cross with her, and sometimes bot even then. So basically, as far as she's concerned I may as well not even be here because she listens to me barely 10% of the time.\n\nIt doesn't help that my husband wants to split from me. He's suffered from clinical depression ever since I've met him and over the last three or four years I've got absolutely nowhere with improving his mental heath. He says i see him as a problem that needs to be fixed and can't deal with feeling like a job on my list anymore. He wants me to talk to him about his feelings more without shutting him down or treating him like an inconvenience. I'm struggling because he has so many feelings about so many things, most of which I can do nothing about. He recently found out how much I hide from him (anything that could make his depression worse, I deal with myself - why would I risk his recovery?) and he feels like this is akin to me lying to him, rather than an act of selfless kindness on my part taking on all the difficult things so he doesnt have to. Plus, I'd always thought that when his mood improved and his depression was brought under more control we'd pick up from where we left off, but he says that he's not the same person he was and that it doesn't work like that. It's been years, and I can't even get him to take his medication ever day - literally the simplist thing in the universe - and haven't even convinced him to do that effectively. How much of a fail is that?!\n\nSo basically, I've run out of time to fix my husband's depression and our relationship as too much time has now elapsed between him being okay ish and really not okay and my babies can basically just be fed by anyone because I'm also failing catastrophically at breastfeeding and my 4 year old doesnt listen to me anyway. Noone actually needs me, so I'm basically pointless. I just don't know where to go from here.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "So first- 4 year olds notoriously don't listen. I've had great luck with tips found in 'how to talk so little kids will listen'. I know your exhausted, so adding a book to your list is unreasonable, but it really helps.\n\nTwo - trying to feed twins, while you are also caring for a 4 year old is rough! Sometimes bodies just don't produce enough and that's why formula is great. You can still bond with your babies during that time, even if it isn't coming from your breast - you are more than a machine that produces milk.\n\nFinally, your husband - it is not your responsibility to fix him. He is an adult, who is making bad choices by not taking his medication. Have you considered couples therapy? He seems to want to talk about his feelings a lot, so he may also benefit from individual therapy as well.",

He is sneaky, and cheeky, turns physical during tantrums, and will attack my husband and I whenever he does not get his way. He goes 0-100 in an instant and it's always walking on egg shells with him. When he is happy, he is charming and a true joy. He has no issues at school and does extremely well, and is very smart. But of course he holds it all in all day to unleash upon me when he is picked up. \n\nA little quick background about him is that he suffered a neonatal stroke at birth, was in the NICU for 8 days, and we have been followed by a neurological pediatrician. We have been exploring the possibility of ADHD/ADD, Anxiety, and PDA but are still not at an official diagnosis (if there even is one). We do not and will never know if his stroke plays a part in his behavior.\n\nHe has a hard time with impulse control and is always getting into things (mostly food) that he is not supposed to get into. We have to lock our fridge at night, hide any pantry food he may get into in our room, and not keep any treats/sweets in our house as he will go looking for it. He has even done this at his grandmother's house when he had a sleepover. He knows not to, but just cannot help himself. This morning however I found one of our pairing knives in the bottom of his and his little brother's laundry basket (he shares a room with his 2 yr old brother). This is the first I've ever found a knife, as he used to look for scissors to open food and we have since hidden those. I know he was most likely trying to open something, but it is still unsettling to find a knife hidden in his room.\n\nI am just so exhausted. I have done parenting courses, therapy, taking anxiety meds for myself, and even doing couples counseling so my husband and I can work as a better team for him. I think maybe I'm just wondering if anyone else has gone though similar experiences with their kiddos?\n\nI really am trying to do whatever I can to help him, but also need to help myself.",

        "content": "Just to add some context since the reason I'm feeling hesitant to pursue this because I'm honestly not a Saint in this situation:\n\nA few years ago, my life was a mess. I was using drugs heavily, was inconsistent with taking my birth control, and ended up pregnant. By the time I figured out that I was, I was so far along that the doctor couldn't give me an accurate timeline of how far along I was. It was between two guys, let's call them Daniel and Jason. I let them both know that there was a 50/50 chance that either of them could be the father. Both of them were at the hospital the day my son was born, and Daniel was the one who ended up stepping into that fatherly role.\n\nFast forward 4 years, me and Daniel broke up when my son was about 2 years old. I had reach out to Jason about taking a paternity test, and at first he aggress to do it, but then ghosts me and I hadn't heard anything from him in about 2 years. I've been taking care of my son since, with the help of my amazing parents, which is such a blessing. I really couldn't do it without them. A couple of weeks ago, Jason adds me on Facebook. I'm thinking he might possibly want a relationship with my son, so I reach out to him via Messenger. He tells me that he didn't realize he had added me on Facebook (sounds like a crock of s*** to me) and that he doesn't want to take responsibility for our son since he's still not sure if he's the father. I suggested that he take a paternity test again, and again, he goes radio silent.\n\nNow I'm wondering if I should hold him accountable and sue him for child support. Like I'd mentioned, I'm clearly not a Saint in this situation, but is it so wrong for me to want him to step up? It really not about the money at this point, it's more out of frustration. I'm also hesitant because I don't want the only reason to do this to be out of vindication, and I feel as though holding him responsible isn't a valid enough reason. Any thoughts and suggestions would be helpful. TIA\n\nEdit: A paternity test was done for Daniel, and he wasn't the father so I'm 100% sure that Jason is the father.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Child support from both biological parents is the right of the child to have. \n\nJason would need to legally be established, via court, as child\u2019s biological father. An attorney can help you navigate how to request this. \n\nAt that point, you\u2019d want to look into child support AND a parenting plan. Even if Jason says he doesn\u2019t want visitation or time, you really should have something on paper that gives you sole legal and physical custody, and that Jason can have visitation at your discretion. This really protects all parties in the future. If Jason does want parenting time, be prepared for him to get something. Step ip plan with some reunification therapy would be appropriate given the length of time he\u2019s been absent.",

After those quick 12-14 weeks went by, I had to go back to work. It was torture for me, I had very bad PPA and would cry every time I had to go to work and leave my son. After a few days of that, my partner and I decided we could make it work with me staying home and taking care of our son and him continuing to work with his dad as a tow truck driver. I got my PPA under control, I got on medication and attended counseling. Fast forward a few months, I found a job at a church part time where I could bring my son with me if I wanted, it was perfect! Fast forward a year later, we were struggling financially. Towing was not providing the income we needed, and my part time income was not much help either. I decided to start looking for other jobs I could potentially do from home or something else part time where I could bring my son, there was nothing. I did however find a job to be a 911 dispatcher.

I am trying to be patient and be aware of his feelings, but these reactions are making me not want to do my job anymore. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSO, my question is, parents who started out as stay at home parents or the 'default' parent and are now the working parent, did your kids act this way as well?

Parents live 4hrs away. I (25f) met her bf (19m) in Aug. She turned 18 in Sept. Found out she was pregnant in Oct. Gave birth Dec. She\u2019s a senior working 2 jobs against my advice. She plans to live with us for at least another year while she gets a car, her license, graduates, and then gets stable enough to move out on her own with or without him. I don\u2019t mind. We both come from an abusive household. We\u2019re the oldest of 10 and I believe she is looking for love and security so I\u2019ve been trying to show her healthier ways to go about achieving that. Lastly she has a dog that she\u2019s obviously too busy for. My husband walks him and hates having the added responsibility. \n\nThe father -\nThe father acts like he\u2019s allergic to jobs. He gets hired and finds an excuse to quit. He is also an aspiring rapper. Nothing I say to her seems to change her mind about him and it seems to only bring them closer. The father however, seems to have his own anger and control issues. He comes off as a narc.\nHe comes over basically everyday and helps with baby. He\u2019s only purchased a couple packs of diapers and a tshirt for baby. Everything else his mom, my sister, our mom, and I got. She asked him to buy a can of milk the other night and he said he didn\u2019t have the money but every time he comes over he has fast food and he just took my sister to get her first tattoo (encouraging her to spend the money she had saved).\n\nMy goal \n I\u2019m hoping their relationship will run its course and if give her the right tools and show her what healthy relationships look like she\u2019ll eventually come to her own conclusion and leave him. Also reduce the chance of baby blues, trauma and animosity.\n\nThe dilemma? \nMy husband (27m) and I have two kids of our own, 3 and 5 years old. We both work full time, I got to school full time, and have a small business. My sister moving in was a huge transition but I love that she\u2019s here. Baby is also a huge transition but also love that she\u2019s here. The dad not so much.

Since he is not working my husband has decided he can\u2019t come back to the house until he gets a job and clocks in full time each week.

My 3 year old son throws tantrums because he wants to leave. Because of that Idk what to do. 1st, we just got there, and 2nd my older child is having fun. It's not fair for them. My 3 year old tantrums are out of control and can go on for hours. He\u2019ll hit himself, hit me, or hit public property. I remove him the best I can. Talk about his emotions but he is too far gone. It is embarrassing. I try to tough it out as long as I can for my other kid but if my spouse isn\u2019t there to help, we eventually leave. Then I feel like I gave into their tantrum and they got what they wanted.\n\nPlease, what is the best thing to do in these situations? I am so embarrassed and desperate for help and guidance.",

Maybe make a list while at the doctor's office of pros and cons of each birth control and let her choose one that fits",

        "content": "So I found out today that I am pregnant , me and my boyfriend found out at the same time , our initial reaction was denial , then after the third positive result and a digital result saying I am 5+ weeks pregnant it became more real . \n\nSo obviously the both of us are still in shock and need to process what\u2019s going on, but his initial reaction is to get rid of it , he\u2019s even joking about wire coat hangers . I , however , while I know we aren\u2019t necessarily prepared for it at the moment , also genuinely think we could make it work , so even though my head is saying it\u2019s not ideal , my heart is saying to keep it . Financially it wouldn\u2019t be a piece of cake , but with government help and emotional support from family , with both of us working , it is doable . \n\nI\u2019ve just got the thought of it being a part of both of us that is becoming an actual life inside me , and the thought of getting rid of that makes me feel guilty . My partner said there wouldn\u2019t be any emotional issue with it because it\u2019s not like we know them and it\u2019s still quite early on , but I disagree , for me there 100% is emotional attachment and feelings about it , this is happening inside me . \n\nI understand that he is in shock and just thinking logically rather than emotionally , but it feels like he thinks that because it wouldn\u2019t make any difference to him emotionally that it wouldn\u2019t make any difference to me either . \n\nHe said he would support me no matter what decision I made , but now I\u2019m starting to think that he just feels he has to accept it because it\u2019s my body , even if it\u2019s not what he wants . \n\nI\u2019m scared that if I did choose to keep it he would resent me for it and hold it as a grudge of why our lives may not end up how we planned . But he doesn\u2019t seem to think it\u2019s possible for me regretting getting rid of it and having feelings of guilt about it . \n\nI am pro choice , but it feels like because im pro choice it\u2019s expected that I will easily make the decision to abort with no second thought or feelings . \n\nI feel like no matter what I do my life is going to change in ways I\u2019m not prepared for , and even thought my BF said he\u2019ll be supportive , the more we talk about it the less it feels that way . \n\nBy the way this was an unplanned pregnancy, I was taking birth control (and correctly) and evidently it seems not to have worked . \n\nAny advice on how to cope with this is welcome , I just really don\u2019t want to feel alone right now .\n\nEDIT : I found out that my boyfriend was cheating on me and was planning on leaving me , I\u2019ve given him options of what to do and time to think about it and he has said that he would like to stay with me and support me . Purely his choice . I told him that he could leave and we could co parent , I told him he could leave and not be involved , and I told him he could stay with me under the condition that if he were to do this again that would be it for our relationship. Having thought about it he said that he does love me and knows it\u2019ll take a lot of work and time to build back trust and make it work . He knows I do not and will not forgive him for what he\u2019s done and has expressed genuine remorse for what he did . \n\n( when I say cheating I mean he was on sexual sites online talking to other girls and had downloaded a dating app to find someone else , this only started just before we found out I am pregnant) \n\nI have told him that I would like for us to tell our families everything (including about the cheating) so they can know how best to support us . His parents have been through cheating before and I hope that they can advise us on how to get through it and build back trust . \n\nTo those of you who judged me and called me selfish ( which I hope you realise is not offering advice at all and is instead adding to my distress) , I hope you take time to reflect the negative impact your words can and do have on a young distressed mum , and I hope that you one day learn that just because i am choosing a different option than you would if you were in my position it does not make me a bad person or a bad parent , if I thought I would be bringing a child into a broken home and would be unable to give them the love and care that they need I would not be doing this . I hope that even if you disagree with my choice you can respect the fact that I am a person with my own thoughts and feelings and that this decision is not one that exists for you to judge me on . \n\nTo those of you who offered genuine advice (even if I didn\u2019t agree with it) thank you very much , this has been a difficult decision and I know I have a very tough road ahead of me , but I wholeheartedly feel that it is the best choice for me and my baby and I appreciate all of you taking the time to offer advice . \n\nI am keeping it , whether he sticks around or not and have discussed with my mum how I would go about that and she has reassured me she will be fully supporting me in any way she can .",

I\u2019m on pregnancy safe medication now but am still worried about this happening again.\n\nDuring my third trimester I had really bad swelling in my ankle to the point where it was hard to walk (and I fell at the OBs office).

My body never responded well to hormonal birth control and he \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to get snipped.\u201d I would be willing to get a copper IUD (Paragard) but I left my job when I had my baby, and with that went my health insurance.

Everyone\u2019s first grandkid, great grandkid, and even great-great grandkid. It brought out the worst in people. Especially my mom. \n   \nLet\u2019s just say she was super controlling, went against all my wishes, and ended up breaking into the birthing ward, cussing out the nurses, and not even meeting my daughter because I wouldn\u2019t let her in the room with me while I was giving birth. That\u2019s just the simplest version of what happened. \n   \nNow with that backstory in mind, I am pregnant again. My mom knows. I thought her and I had worked out our issues and that we were past all of that nonsense. But, I guess we are not. \n   \nI started off by setting firm boundaries early. Well at least I told her our plans. She shot all of them down immediately. \n   \nShe couldn\u2019t be in the first ultrasound? (Because my husband couldn\u2019t be there and he wanted to see the new baby before anyone else did) Oh just let me come in, what if I video it for him! You guys don\u2019t want to find out the gender? Well that\u2019s dumb you NEED to know so you (so I) can prepare properly! And you have to pick a name fast so I can monogram everything. (She knows I hate monograms) \n   \nThe worst part is that she already knows she\u2019s not allowed in the delivery room and that I\u2019m not budging on that. So she wants to watch my daughter while we\u2019re there. The only issue with that is that she lives hours away and we want my SIL to watch our daughter because she lives 10 minutes from the hospital and can bring her to meet her new sibling. \n   \nShe lost it and told me how it\u2019s not fair for HIS sister to meet the baby first and that if SIL was allowed at the hospital that I had to let her in as well. I reminded her that SIL isn\u2019t just \u201chis\u201d sister. She\u2019s my sister now too. She said that it doesn\u2019t matter because she\u2019s a parent and parents come before siblings. She then proceeded to tell people that I was pregnant after she had promised to keep it a secret until we were ready to share the news (I\u2019m guessing as revenge). \n   \nI can\u2019t let her get away with this but I can\u2019t think of a calm solution either. I\u2019m afraid to go low/no contact with her because then I wouldn\u2019t be able to see my dad or siblings who still live at home.

        "most_upvoted_comment": "Hi! My biggest thing is to empathize with you. I was 20 when I had my first daughter and was not ready for how much it changed people, myself included. Good on you for realizing there is an issue, I didn\u2019t realize until much later and have gone no contact out of necessity. \n\nMy mom pushed her way into every OB/GYN appt, the delivery, and who could visit the baby. Which later progressed to her controlling birthday parties, overly involving herself in my child\u2019s schooling, and others involved in my child\u2019s life, etc. Even though I was an adult at the time, and should\u2019ve recognized how crappy it was, I didn\u2019t want to disappoint her. I was not yet mentally strong to recognize her behavior as unsupportive or to defend myself against the cognitive dissonance, you are through half the battle already by recognizing it. \n\nWhat ended up happening, after about 10 years of caving to her and prioritizing her comfort over everyone else, including my husband\u2019s, is I had to go no contact. The fights were exhausting, the boundary overstepping had me in defense mode all the time, and the anxiety about standing up for myself against her was too much. She also started to triangulate my daughter against me, as your mom is doing with you and your husband, you and your dad, etc. \n\nMentally  prepare yourself to be a \u201cdisappointing child\u201d any way you go, whether no contact, not cooperating, or whatever. If she\u2019s anything like my mom, you\u2019ll be smeared as selfish, uncaring, and ruinous to people you care about and will likely lose relationships. It\u2019s been over a year of NC now and we are doing good now that the major volatility is over with. \n\nNo advice to give but know that I empathize and you\u2019re not crazy.

        "content": "Hey all,\n\nJust a disclaimer, I don\u2019t want any bashing of my fianc\u00e9 and his family. I\u2019m completely aware I\u2019m not the only problem here but I\u2019m just asking this for myself as I\u2019m the only person that I can control in this. I\u2019m just giving a few examples.\n\nSo I recently had my first baby not long ago. Everything is going well. I didn\u2019t really get the baby blues and i\u2019m not experiencing any depression however having a baby has really shined a major flaw that i have possessed for a very long time which is that I\u2019m a huge people pleaser and it is effecting my happiness/peace especially now that I have a child to look after. Ever since my baby was born my fianc\u00e9\u2019s family have not been very considerate of me or care to ask for my wishes during both the birthing process and the weeks following my baby\u2019s birth. I will say that there is a culture difference and a language barrier so that doesn\u2019t help.\n\nMainly his mother likes to \u201ctell\u201d me advice all the time which some I don\u2019t agree with and it goes against modern medicine. Recently, my baby was sick and my mother in law came over to give my baby a remedy. I wasn\u2019t comfortable with it as I felt the safest thing for my child was to drink milk and let the virus run its course as she\u2019s too young to take medicine. I allowed her to give my baby this remedy though despite my feelings on it because hey, maybe she knows something? Plus I hate confrontation. Well the next day after my baby didn\u2019t eat for 3-5 hours, she only drank a half an ounce and it sent me into panic mode. Thankfully she ended up being fine and it wasn\u2019t the remedy causing it but the guilt I had thinking that it was, was immense.\n\nAnother example, my family threw a welcome party for my baby the day we came home from the hospital and never ask if I or my fianc\u00e9 were ok with it. People came in and didn\u2019t wash their hands or wear a mask. My fianc\u00e9 said nothing to them about it as he didn\u2019t want to be \u201crude\u201d. Thankfully my baby didn\u2019t get sick. \n\nTo keep this short his family seems to just do things without asking me or my fianc\u00e9. My fianc\u00e9 is laid back so he doesn\u2019t care enough to say anything. He thinks I\u2019m just being too protective. I have a whole list of things but these two examples I\u2019ve mentioned were the icing on the cake and the main reasons for me making this therapy appointment. My fianc\u00e9 just lets his family do whatever and I feel that if I speak up, he won\u2019t have my back even though he always tells me to just voice my opinion to them. \n\nAs horrible as it sounds, this has caused me to have thoughts of wanting to abandon him and my baby because I feel no one respects or considers me and they would be happier if it was just him and his mother raising my baby. Yes, logically I know me disappearing won\u2019t fix anything and would just make things worse. I also don\u2019t have the heart to and would never abandon my baby. It\u2019s just that my issue with confrontation is literally so bad, I\u2019ve had these thoughts. I also feel like I\u2019m a bad mother because I can\u2019t seem to stand up for what I feel is best for her and I just end up with anxiety in the end. My baby cant speak and I know that I\u2019m her only voice right now.\n\nWith all this said, I\u2019m starting to second guess going to this appointment for fear of how I\u2019ll be seen because I can\u2019t seem to voice my opinion and stand by it. I also fear that they\u2019ll think I\u2019m an unfit parent and take my baby from me if I reveal to them that I allowed my baby to be fed something that I was uncomfortable with and goes against modern medicine.

Then, noticing her at school events next to her class, she is well underdeveloped. I'm all for veganism and vegetarianism for many reasons, but I don't understand why someone would force something (like controlling food intake) onto a child. I have tired to increase her protein intake when she is with us but she has this instilled fear of meat and dairy because of her Mom's obsession with controlling what she eats. She has her 100% convinced that meat and dairy are very unhealthy. I don't really know where to start with her except trying to turn her onto some type of food educational information. Any good books? YouTube Channels? Anything with basic facts about the food pyramid and why a balanced diet is best.",

        "content": "Hello reddit. I'm in over my head here and don't know what to do. \n\nI met my girlfriend online about 18 months ago.  We got along great for the most part and flew back and forth to visit each other every month or so.  About 3 months ago we decided to take the next step and have her move in with me.  She's a small town girl who never flew before she met me so I understood moving to a big city would be a big step for her. Needless to say she's been very homesick and generally unhappy here.  I tried to take her to things and do whatever I could to cheer her up but nothing seemed to penetrate her veil of sadness.  \n\nThen the worst possible thing happened... she got pregnant.  She stopped her birth control to take some new psych meds that weren't compatible with her BC, and didn't tell me about it. That's a whole other topic for another time I suppose, but she's very against abortion, and to be honest I feel a little funny about the idea of killing my kid too. I almost talked her into having one, then felt horrible and talked her out of it again. I think that idea is now pretty much off the table. \n\nBut now she's growing more and more insistent on moving home to be around her family again for the support.  Unfortunately I'm tied to the area I live in right now for work.  I don't have a great education or job history and anything I'd be able to get for work down where she lives wouldn't be anywhere near as profitable as what I'm doing here now.  I'm in my early 40s (shes late 20s) and would rather not pump gas somewhere just so my GF can be closer to her family.  She knew all this before agreeing to move in with me of course.  I'd always told her we'd need to live here for at least a few more years before considering moving.  \n\nShe's also suddenly developed issues with things she was ok with before like my pot smoking habit and my lazy lifestyle. Both things she was well aware of throughout our relationship.  Meanwhile I'm growing increasingly frustrated with her because she hasn't lifted a finger towards getting any kind of job here.  I've paid her share of the rent for 3 months now without so much as a thank you or any type of acknowledgment.  That was not the arrangement we discussed at all. I understand she's nauseous from the pregnancy but is that really an excuse to not earn a living? Even 1 day a week I'd be thrilled about, just any type of effort to contribute would be nice. Instead, I've been spending extra time to make money for her collecting online casino bonuses using her accounts, and she actually has the nerve to get mad at me every time I need to use her phone for 5 seconds to do something like that.  Spoiled brat is the only term I can think of to describe her behaviour...\n\nSo today I confronted her about her lack of a job after she got mad at me for asking to send an email from her phone, and it predictably lead to her playing victim and redirecting everything to be my fault. She now claims she's moving back home after the new year. Normally I'd just be relieved but now my child is involved and I feel absolutely terrible about it. I do not want it to grow up broke with an incredibly irresponsible mother or with an absent father.  I want the kid to have the best life possible. I could bite the bullet, move down there with her and try to find some shitty job I'd be miserable at, but i feel like our relationship is doomed anyway at this point.  I doubt I could win a custody battle since they usually favor the mothers. \n\nWhat should I do here reddit? I'm so lost :(",

Thank you so much.\n\n\nI am a man who raised my daughter alone since she was 2.  I loved being a single dad. I loved every minute of watching her grow into a woman.  At 9 she was diagnosed with T1 diabetes. It broke my heart when she asked how long she needed to take shots and I had to say \"forever\".  She has done so well and has just been certified as a Certified Nurse Assistant and plans on continuing on. \n\n She lives with me.  I have been a part of all her growth. We are super close discussing everything. Periods, birth control, std, pregnancy,  etc .  I always said that she shouldn't get pregnant until she has her life straight. I still support her financially (alot).  I have been pretty open and clear if she was to get preggo I couldn't support her and she would need to live with the father. \n\nShe has told me her dream is to have children. I said no problem but get your life straight first. Especially with health benefits. (Because of diabetes and a baby.) I also told her to go back to her therapist and tell them her feelings on having a baby.\n\nWell yesterday she hit me with I'm 5 Weeks preggo. She has in the past taken a morning after pill, just for back story.  I said you are not ready financially or emotionally for this. You need to consider an abortion and therapy for thinking multiple kids is a goal in life. I said this is my opinion as your father.  But I'm out as your checkbook.

I feel she was just at a point in life to make good money and get straight and now this.  I know many people have done the same with early kids and had great lives.  But it's hard for me.  \n\nThank you for taking time for your lives to read this. Time is finite and you spent some on me\n\n\n******edit for clarification ******\nThis was most definitely not accidental. I should have included that. Which is why I feel the way I do. We have spoken about this for months.  I said the time isn't right. Give it 2 years at least of job and her bf.  She has known the guy a month.  He isn't to bright either to be okay with this happening.  The rule was live with me take the pill.  She said no to my rule.\n\nAnd I will add I'm heartbroken. I love her.  I wanted to cheer becoming a grandparent.  But I can't,  I just can't be happy and for that I feel guilty too.\n\n**edit 2 finances - none. I don't know why she has this entitlement to a momey tree. I explained all my money is gone from her and her schooling.  Etc. So there is nothing, that scares me the most.  She thinks there is some hidden funds. But nothing. She will be on public assistance. \n\n**I need to get some sleep. Thank you all so much. Each of you.

They have had 4 kids total. \n\nThe husband is emotionally and psychologically abusive and plays the \"good parent\" part a little too well. All of his actions are in his favor to be the favorite parent. Undermines my cousin at every turn. Their oldest has started stealing, cussing at everyone, trying to get out of going school. There's no boundaries in this kids mind. Everything my cousin has tried to do is fruitless because of his lack parenting. \n\nTheir second missed out on so much potential help because this guy refused to admit that something was wrong with his boy. He's autistic, and we told this guy many times that something was wrong. Wouldn't even listen to the birth to 3 people when they said something wasn't right and that he was missing major milestones. He's now 8 and still non verbal and is just now  potty training. He had to be put in a special school to handle him. And it's because of that school that he's making so many gains in his development.\n\nThey now have another child who is looking at an autism diagnosis as she is 3 and has missed many of her milestones as well. \n\n\nShe wants to leave, but he has financial control over her as she's not working, they have 1 car (he killed the one I sold to her by running it on no oil).

        "content": "Apologies for the wall of text, and thank you to anyone who actually makes it to the end. I just want to provide as much context as possible. I know my farts don\u2019t usually stink, but when they do, oh god, I\u2019m so, so sorry. My deepest and most sincere apologies. And if there is one thing that the pandemic has really made difficult, it is relearning how to fart quietly when I\u2019m not at home. Or worse, farting when there isn\u2019t plausible deniability as to who did it (when you are in your boss\u2019 office for your performance review is just not ideal). But on to the matter at hand!\n\nTL:DR \u2013 In-laws won\u2019t come to visit our newborn because of an argument between my wife and her sibling. \n\nSo now for all the backstory! My wife and I just welcomed our first baby. We've been super excited having our little one here, but it has been a little stressful (who\u2019d have thunk?) \u2013 but mainly because of the headache that we are dealing with coming from my in-laws. \n\nMy wife comes from a somewhat conservative, Christian, patriarchal, immigrant background - where family is supposed to come first. Her family live a 45-minute drive away. An hour with traffic. 2-hours by bike or public transit. Or 6 hours walking. Thanks Google! \n\nThe main issue is that my wife is no longer speaking to her younger sibling (let\u2019s refer to her as Jane) because Jane has been emotionally abusive for many years now. The two of them were very close friends throughout their childhood, but over the last few years since I have been in the picture, Jane starts an argument with my wife every single fall and then stops talking to my wife for several months. And then at some random point, Jane acts as if nothing ever happened and they are all fine again.\n\nA week before the last incident, Jane promised to never repeat this behavior. But, as you already figured out from the last sentence, there was another incident. \n\nThe last incident was last year when my wife and I were celebrating Thanksgiving with my wife's side of the family (her parents, her older sibling (we\u2019ll call Brenda), Brenda's son and younger sister Jane). An argument broke out that evening between Brenda and Jane when Jane was badgering Brenda\u2019s son. My wife took Jane to the side and listened to what Jane was complaining about regarding Brenda. And then things seemed to calm down.\n\nShortly thereafter, we all sat down for Thanksgiving dinner. In the middle of the toast, Jane got up, packed up all her things, and went home. When my wife reached out to see if Jane was okay, Jane never responded to my wife. We took leftovers over to Jane\u2019s place and she never answered the door (we heard her inside). So we ended up just taking the leftovers back to the rest of the family. It was as if Jane was now mad at my wife for some reason.\n\n2022 had a lot in store for us (namely our wedding and now a baby). A point of clarification regarding the conservative Christian values: we were married before we conceived, but due to something called Corona Virus (heard of it?), we held off awhile on having a wedding for people to attend.\n\nSo, although Jane was not talking to my wife, my wife assumed that Jane was still going to be part of the wedding. Then came January and we got an angry call from Mother-in-Law that she was really mad at my wife because my wife had supposedly called Jane \u201cIt\u201d at some point (the horror)! I mean, of all the insulting things they have called each other in their fights that I have seen every fall, this had to be one of the most underwhelming. Sure, you could also make an argument that \u201cit\u201d is dehumanizing. But seriously? \n\nTo me, it seemed like Jane was just trying to find cover/distract from the fact that she had been avoiding and ignoring my wife. What better way to distract from the issues than to run to mommy and say \"sister called me 'it.'\" I hope I did those quotes inside of quotes correctly along with the punctuation.\n\nWe then find out that Brenda told Jane that my wife called Jane \u201cIt.\u201d If this happened, it would have been when both Brenda and my wife were complaining to each other about Jane\u2019s behavior. And if \u201cit\u201d really bothered Brenda so much, why couldn\u2019t she be woman enough to call out my wife on something that she sees as an issue? \n\nSo, after some convincing, my wife agrees to call and apologize to Jane. Jane answers the phone and keeps saying \u201chello\u201d like she can\u2019t hear my wife. My wife keeps asking her if she can hear her and if she has a minute. Jane then says \u201cI\u2019m trying to judge your tone. No, we\u2019re not doing this now because of your tone. This is why I\u2019m not coming to your wedding.\u201d My wife was floored and retaliated by telling Jane to \u201chave a good life\u201d because she was done with her.\n\nWe told my mother-in-law who we thought was going to tell dad-in-law. Apparently, she didn\u2019t. She tried to control the information going to the Patriarchy. Anyhow, we told father-in-law, and he was bothered by this but promised to get to the bottom of it. We didn\u2019t really want him to. We just thought he should know. MIL then got pissed at us for going around her.\n\nSo, instead of leaving things alone, the in-laws pretty much forced the younger one to go to the wedding. This resulted in us seeing Jane mean-mugging my wife while she walked down the aisle (we\u2019ve got photos and \u201cthrilled\u201d is not the word anyone would use to describe Jane). Jane also had the brilliant idea of complaining about us for a good hour or two during the reception to our friends, who, as you might have guessed, told us about it afterwards. You know, because friends have our back, unlike some of our siblings.\n\nWhatever, we rolled our eyes and moved on and basically have forgotten about Jane. So, fast-forward to my wife just giving birth to our wonderful baby. In-laws know that we still aren\u2019t bothering interacting with Jane. Jane can find out about our lives second hand for all we care. We aren\u2019t going to waste time and energy on her. You know, at least until I spend a stupid amount of time writing this reddit post for internet strangers to judge us and our extended family. Please do!\n\nSo, baby is born, I send text messages to Brenda, Nephew, Mother and Father-in-law letting them all know. My in-laws were traveling overseas on a non-refundable trip. So we knew they wouldn\u2019t be able to come visit for a little bit. They asked if I messaged both siblings and I ignored that message. We had enough going on at the hospital. \n\nBefore the In-Laws had even left on their trip, we asked them to quarantine for a bit after they returned, which they were fine with. But when we called them the Thursday before the weekend that they were supposed to come over, they asked if it was okay for the whole family to come. Well, Brenda and nephew had already visited the week before. We quickly saw through what they were trying to ask. We told them that the two of them were more than welcome to come visit. \n\nThey didn\u2019t like this and said they needed to talk. Mother-in-law calls us back a few minutes later on my wife\u2019s phone and asks to speak to me, probably because of the Patriarchy and hoping that I\u2019m the \u201cMan of the House\u201d and can speak reason to my hysterical wife. /s And yes, I know the origin of the word \u201chysteria\u201d and how it has been used over the centuries (really quite fascinating: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteria) \\- TIL). So yeah, I told MIL that anything she wants to say to me, she can say in front of my wife because we are equal partners.\n\nMIL then hung up on us. FIL called back a little while later and said they would not be able to come. And several weeks later, they still haven\u2019t called us.\n\nI feel like they are trying to go after my wife in their mistaken perception that she is vulnerable right now and that we are stressed out of our minds and can\u2019t deal at all with our sweet little baby who only has 3 states \u2013 eating, pooping, or sleeping. How is this a \u201cloving family\u201d if you can\u2019t be bothered to meet your grandchild because two of your kids aren\u2019t talking to each other? \n\nAs you might think, this has been hard on my wife \u2013 postpartum issues are bad enough, but this whole family thing has really made her into an emotional wreck. All we wanted was for the grandparents to meet their grandchild and to plan on being part of each other\u2019s lives. We aren\u2019t looking for them to stay with us and cook, and clean, and change diapers (my parents flew across the country and did the first two for two weeks and will be back again soon for a few more days).\n\nMy wife also called up a friend of her parents who is of a similar background to ask her for advice. She thought it was very bizarre that MIL and FIL had not yet visited and that it wasn\u2019t right. We also told her about the issues with Jane (and she said she had noticed Jane was a bit off at the wedding). She went and talked to MIL and FIL and then came back to us with \u201cmake things right with Jane.\u201d We explained a little bit more about what was going on with Jane and she seemed to understand, but also seemed to be in the \u201cjust make up with Jane to make your parents happy boat.\u201d She also told us that MIL claimed that we hung up on her\u2026 Lovely!\n\nAnyhow, that\u2019s where we are at now. I\u2019m not sure what my exact question is. But I know my wife is concerned about getting \u201cdisowned.\u201d I don\u2019t think it is that bad. I think the relationship she has with her parents is being redefined in a way that makes my wife much more distant and distrusting of them. I doubt we\u2019ll be leaving our child in their care anytime soon. So much for free baby sitting!\n\nAre we being too stubborn by wanting to not deal with someone who causes a stupid amount of drama, that happens to be family? Or should we just suck it up? Or should we sell everything, move into a yurt in some remote place and disconnect from the internet and grow our own organic internets? Is there another option? We've tried laying things out to my In-Laws, but they could really use some lessons on active listening.",

Every morning before Jake goes to work he talks to my belly and says \"good morning baby, daddy loves you a million and 1. I'll chat with you when I get home. Please dont make mommy too sickies today, she's gotta eat so you can get big and strong in there\" and every day when he gets home he tells womb nugget \"hey little dude/dudette, I missed you two today. I hope you and mommy had a good day\" and every night before bed, he tells womb nugget \"goodnight little buddy. Sleep well and sweet dreams. Get big and strong in there okay\" \n\nAnd all throughout the day he rubs my belly (after asking because he knows I'm not used to *that* kind of touch during my previous pregnancies) and I always let him. But here is the issue. His daughter \"Kaitlynn\", 6 has started asking if she can do it too. His son \"Adam\", 5 isn't too interested. At first I didn't mind Kaitlynn talking to my belly but she lifted my shirt up to my bra when I let her do it even after telling her not to lift my shirt. She has also done this, in public, without asking. She lifted my shirt all the way up without any warning. The issue here is this specific day I was not waring a bra because my *girls* were extremely tender and swollen. Both Jake and I have told her not to touch me without asking *I'm a victim of abuse and any type of unexpected physical contact can throw me into a panic attack.* And we have both told her multiple times not to lift my shirt when she does have permission to touch my belly. She refuses to listen. So, he suggested that he can be the \"bad guy\" and tell her that she can no longer touch me. But I'm stuck wondering, would I be the a-hole if I don't let her touch my belly anymore?\n\nEDIT: a major issue is that she finds my reaction to be funny and shows no empathy for the fact that she is doing something that I do not like. When her dad tells her not to touch my belly if she cannot respect my boundaries she says that it's funny to lift up my shirt because I get mad. I don't actually get mad, I simply tell \"her we do not lift other people's shirts without their permission.\"",

        "content": "Will try to be as brief as possible while capturing the gist. We (36f and 35m) have a six month old baby girl whom we love to pieces. We have been together for 13 years and married for 7. It has been full of ups and downs and we should have separated before bringing a life into this world but here we are..\nSince her birth , things have gone downhill steeply. We kept arguing and fighting for first 2-3 months and after that we have stopped talking other than related to baby. Essentially just co parents living together. My husband says there's probably no love from his side anymore because of the things I haven't changed in all these years despite him begging me to and it's reached crescendo now. I know I'm at fault for some of these such as being controlling wrt small things and finances, bringing up and fighting about past issues every time there's a new argument ( my defense because we don't communicate well and related things come up ) among other things. We started therapy and he thinks only I need to work on things then there's hope and he has nothing left to work on. He stopped counseling also as he believed it was not working. I still love him and tried showing him affection, care, love many times during past couple of months but he has been cold and indifferent. \nI also have a lot of issues with him ( I don't know if these are actually comparable and big enough as he has but these make me unhappy) mental load of chores.. He cooks half the meals, throws out trash, helps with baby a lot but most of the things else require me constantly planning reminding and he has no appreciation..I feel he doesn't prioritize me as much as he does his parents and brother and if I have anything critical to say, it can lead to a huge fight..I was hoping these things change after baby but they haven't.. He has been rude and not treating me with hardly any care after the birth, complete contrast from  pregnancy when he would care so much and be nice and in we enjoyed the time.. I also feel like he doesn't care much about things I care about if it requires putting even some bit of effort. He is aware of these issues .\nCurrent situation is such that ( fortunate to mat leave upto 9 months) and all the time I just think worry about the future, heartbroken about current situation and question myself constantly.. we both have said to each other horrible hurtful things in the past. I don't know if I was right in hoping that postpartum he would be a little more understanding, caring..\n\nMy dilemma now is.. Whether to move on or continue in this marriage where we don't argue but are just mostly indifferent so that our daughter has both parents under one roof. He says maybe as I change slowly love can come back..I want to change the things about not fighting over past issues, letting things go etc but he doesn't think he needs to work on much. Thing is he loves our baby more than anything and I know he'll be a great father. And knowing him, he'll not remarry or have another kid. He believes I have ruined his life. Will divorcing with 70:30/60:40 custody be a bad step with very amicable co-parenting? He's also the more fun parent and I'm sure they will have a great bond so will my daughter hate me for not staying together for and working even harder on our marriage. If theres no physical abuse , infedility because she will love her dad more? We both want to do what's best for her.. should I feel guilty about my husband ending up alone ( although even I may and will have to give up hope of having a second child) .. I am constantly stressed and it's affecting my physical health as well.. I believe we should only stay together in a happy marriage to model that for our baby but not sure how long to try..

I was confused because outside of a few times per her request to not wear a condom and \"finish\" inside her I wore protection. I didn't have sexual experience prior to her outside of sex ed but knew about birth control and condoms. She was adamant it was safe and she was on birth control. I've confronted her about this via text a few times and she said she was lost, on drugs,  and wanted a family. I had no idea about this so obviously I've been resentful the entire time. My dad died when I was 12 so I'm not super familiar with how a actual dad should be but I'm sure I'm not it. I've been absent for years at times and consistently present for years at times but I still feel cheated. Shortly after the pregnancy I turned to alcohol. That hasnt changed. Is there a way to get over petty resentment and actually be a solid father figure? Sure child support sucks and used to be the biggest factor but now I'm just trying to not short stick the only innocent party. The way I see it I'm the guilty innocent party and she's the innocent innocent party. Any girl I've been with tells me to just sign my rights away. 1. You can't. 2. Doesn't help my daughter. 3. Doesn't fix the guilt of not being an active father.",

HOWEVER, we all know it happens and I\u2019m proud of my daughter for telling me she feels she\u2019s ready and wants to be safe. I will provide condoms as well, but I did take her to the doctor who went over her options, which basically came down to pills, an implant in the arm, IUD, or a shot. \n\nI\u2019m so out of the loop here. I had a hysterectomy very young for medical reasons and am in over my head. I did tell me daughter to research those options and let me know her thoughts and what she\u2019s comfortable with. Is it all personal preference, or are some safer than others for teens? The pcp did say the pills would not require an exam (they did a basic \u2018look\u2019 to check for normal development, but not a pelvic), but the others would require a gynecologist.\n\nEdit to add: yes, she has had the hpv vaccine. Yes, we have stressed the importance of condoms. We pretty much made it clear that it would be incredibly irresponsible to ever NOT use a condom unless she\u2019s in a monogamous long-term relationship (preferably married) and ready to have kids. However, I\u2019ve heard way too many horror stories of guys stealthing. Not to mention, teen hormones are insane and I know it doesn\u2019t always make for the best decision-making in the heat of the moment. And no, I\u2019m not encouraging or supporting her becoming sexually active. If I had my choice, she would wait until she\u2019s about 25. But I\u2019m also not that naive. We have extensively educated about STDs/STIs (with pictures). I just want to keep my baby as safe as possible, while providing an open, loving relationship between us so she can continue coming to me for anything. Also, a few people have mentioned family history-we do not know her personal family history and have no way of getting that info.\n\nEdit 2: we had a nice discussion, after both of us reading most of the comments (there are so many and I can\u2019t keep up!). We are both leaning towards the arm implant TO START but understand that each method is very individual and we may decide another method would work better. We also practiced putting a condom on a banana (I know, so clich\u00e9, but it works) and going over the importance there (including expiration dates, storage, etc). I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m ready for this, but it\u2019s happening whether I like it or not.",

That fact is clearly displayed in the comments here. Some liken an IUD insertion to mideval tourture and want them to be banned, while others go to soccer practice right after the procedure and have nothing but light cramps. Some have a nexplanon migrate up their arm, which requires surgery. Some started with Implanon amd are now getting their third Nexplanon because they love it so much. Some got pregnant on the pill, Some have been on the pill for 30 years who absolutely no issues. It is truly impossible to tell which birth control will be the best for your daughter right off the bat. Please believe me, everyone in the gynecology field wished there were an easier way to tell what will work for everyone. The vast majority of the time it's a game of trial and error. I sincerely hope she finds a birth control that she will love, sooner rather than later!",

She had food poisoning a few weeks ago and I let her stay home until she felt better. Kids where out last week due to fall break and I thought that would be perfect for her to sit home and recover so she would be all good to go back on Monday. \n\nMonday morning came and she went in first period but asked me to come get her once the class was over, saying she felt like she was going to have diarrhea (which she did) and I brought her home. I took her to the doctor later that afternoon and they ran blood work on her (still waiting for those results) and told her to stay home from work/school for 1-2 days and prescribed her some medication for her nausea. I picked her up yesterday after I picked up her medicine and she took off work. \n\nFlash forward to this morning, I get a text at 5am from her asking if we have any Midol because she just started her period and her cramps are \u201cso bad she slept on the bathroom floor\u201d.

        "content": "hello! i\u2019m (27 F) a single mom to a very sweet 2 year old boy. his father (26 M) is not in the picture at all. he\u2019s an emotionally abusive person, an alcoholic and he sexually assaulted a friend of mine. i was also told, after going no contact, by a reliable source that he was sexting with 17 year olds. obviously i chose the absolute worst person to have a child with. the more serious revelations did not come out until a little over a year ago. i had already left him due to the alcoholism and emotional abuse but was still trying to let him be involved with supervised visitation. he was supposedly sober but soon he started trying to control me and it was apparent to me that he was drinking again. i moved in the middle of the night without telling him because he knew where we lived and i didn\u2019t feel safe about that. he has never physically harmed me but there were several times in the relationship where it seemed like violence was about to happen ie punching holes in doors, driving erratically to scare me, and pounding on the steering wheel. he would also scream at me in drunken rage saying things that didn\u2019t make sense. when i saw sings of this behavior re emerge i decided he would simply never see me or my son again. the cycle of abuse is a real thing and i had been convinced he was better but i think having my son finally snapped me out of it and i realized he would never change. we moved and i have not seen or heard from him since. his name is not on the birth certificate so getting any kind of visitation with my son would be an uphill battle for him and tbh he just doesn\u2019t care enough to even try. all that to say we are safe and away from him and hopefully we will never see him again. \n\nthis last week however, my son is constantly talking about \u201cdaddy\u201d. we don\u2019t even say that word in our house. my own father died a few years back and there\u2019s just no use for the word. i\u2019m sure he is hearing it at daycare where other kids do have daddies. i think it\u2019s primarily coming from pick up time. i imagine the other kids saying \u201cdaddy!\u201d when their father comes to pick them up. he usually brings it up when we are on the way home from daycare. he has been saying \u201cdaddy!\u201c and \u201ci want my daddy!\u201d i don\u2019t know how much he even understands the concept of a daddy though at this age. whenever he brings up daddy i tell him something like  \u201cwell we don\u2019t have daddy but that\u2019s okay. every family looks different. some have two daddies, some have two mamas, some have one dad, some have one mama, some have grandmas, papas, aunts and uncles. and that\u2019s okay. you have plenty of people who love you and our family is great.\u201d he often responds to me with frustration of some sort. he might kick his feet or even spit when i give him the spiel. i almost think maybe he is upset because he wants this thing, this \u201cdaddy\u201d and i\u2019m telling him we don\u2019t have this thing. similar to when he asks for a snack we don\u2019t have at the time. \n\ni\u2019m just really not sure how much he understands and if i\u2019m approaching this right. i would love to believe he has no understanding yet but even if that is the case he probably will understand soon. i guess i just thought i had more time to figure out what to say. we really do have a great family. he has me, my sister who he adores, my mom, her husband, my grandparents, and friends who are chosen family. i don\u2019t want him to be hung up on what he\u2019s missing but i also want to make space for his very valid feelings should he have them. is anyone else in a similar boat? how do you approach these conversations? am i doing enough or too much? please please advise. it makes me so sad to hear him calling out for someone who doesn\u2019t even deserve him.",

        "content": "I have an awesome two year old son. He's the best thing that's ever happened to me. I've always looked forward to being a dad and getting to enjoy all the ins and outs of parenting. \n\nHowever the pregnancy and first year was rough. My son's Mother (M) went through a rough time during the pregnancy. She found out her daughter had been abused by a family member, and things deteriorated between us. I wasn't able to help, not from the lack of trying, but she didn't want me there, and said that I was just stressing her out, and that it was bad for the baby. She broke up with me, and I didn't fight to stay with her. I didn't want to cause stress. I didn't want to harm my child because I wanted to express emotions and how I feel. I just wanted to focus on what I thought was the best thing, and that was to be a good parent and accept that being a parent was more important. I gave her space to breathe for a month. Partly to be respectful and give her the space she needed, the other part was to not add to the stress she was already dealing with. I heard nothing for a month, so I tried keeping up with her on a weekly basis cause I'm still going to be a dad at the end of the day, and wanted to be there. \n\nNo matter how much I tried to be there, I wasnt allowed to. I didn't get to go to appointments (cause she didn't want me there), I didn't get to be involved in naming our son, not from the lack of trying to have the conversation. She just didn't want my input and I didn't get to be there for the birth of my son. (although covid was the thing there so can't say definitively about that). I thought that I was going to be cut out of my son's life. I made YouTube diaries just so I could hopefully one day if it came to it, show him how much he meant to me during that time and how much I wanted to be there. I just didn't want him to grow up thinking that I was apathetic to what was going on. I wanted him to see that what I was doing was a hard balance of trying to be there, while making sure that his mother was okay, because I don't think I could have lived with myself if something happened to him because of me.  \n\nAs soon as my son was born I have paid maintenance for him. It was a non starter for me. Didn't matter what was going on, he was my son and I was going to make sure I was contributing to his well being. Few days later,  I managed to talk to her brother and have an actual conversation. I couldn't understand why it had gotten to this point. I still don't. By the end of the conversation, he saw that I was just trying to be a dad and not cause any problems. He made me promise to give it a year and I could take him overnight. I was okay to accept that because yeah he needs his mother for some time before I could take him for a day or more, and I was just trying to have some connection with my son. Plus it was made clear both literally and implied that she was in control and making the rules. I was willing to try and make this work for the sake of my son, but I was more than willing to take it to the courts if this continued. He was here now and it was all about him. I think he did help in talking her round cause when she got home, I was able to meet my son for the first time. \n\nIt was a fantastic moment getting to hold my son for the first time. The only downside was being gaslight by her and her mother with \"You weren't being cut out .\" Or \"You were always going to be his dad\". I couldn't respond to those statements. Nothing during that time alluded to that. So I got to see my son on a weekly basis for a few hours at my ex's. I got to feed him, have him sleep in my arms and be a part of his life (while small, meant the world to me) for his first year. \n\nJust as he was about to turn one, I brought up the discussion of being able to take him overnight. The response I got annoyed me. \"Oh I've been waiting for you to ask, you could have taken him sooner. I would love a day off being a mum\". I did try to talk to her about why things happened the way they did. It was pointless. A lot of deflecting and not acknowledging both how she handled it and how it effected me. \n\nWithin a week or two, I was getting to have my son overnight at least once a week. Now I take him 2-3 days a week, still pay maintenance, and get to be the dad I always wanted to be. \n\nBut its hard to be reminded every time I call my son his name, that I was cut out of the journey of him coming into the world. Not having any input in his name, not having my surname, no middle names. It's hard not to think of that time where every day, I felt like I was failing before he was even here, always wondering what I could do to make things better, or do better. I wish and hope that he will understand one day how much he means to me and how much I wish I could have been able to be involved in those big moments. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read my story. I just wanted to get it off my chest and hope it helps anyone who has been there or in a similar place.",

        "title": "Control Issues",
        "content": "Dear Reddit, I am writing for some advice. Let me apologize now for the long post. \nI have come to the conclusion that I have both a controlling husband and mother. Over the years they have slowly started to dislike each other and I believe it\u2019s because they are so similar. \n\nSome background of my husband, we\u2019ve been married for 4 years and have 2 kids. After the birth of our oldest, I started to see his controlling side coming out. Mainly in how we would parent. It has caused a lot of arguments in the past. \n\nThe MAIN problem that I have with him is that he complains about being overwhelmed with the kids  and not having enough help. I work on weekends so he\u2019s mostly alone with both. However when my mother offers to watch one or both kids for him, he finds some reason to refuse and continues to complain. \n\nOver the years my mom would ask to babysit or have the kid(s) and he would always instantly say no and his reasoning was mostly bc it would mess up our kids sleep schedule and we would be stuck dealing with them. I fought with him about it for a long time but now I mostly agree with him. Our oldest does better on a set schedule which my mom has NO COMPREHENSION of. I finally got my mom to agree to give him a nap if he sleeps over and put him to sleep at his usual bed time. \n\nStill I had to beg and plead with my husband each time for my mom to spend time with our kid. Our youngest is still really young and doesn\u2019t go over as often yet. He\u2019s not a fan of our child sleeping over and states that he would rather have my mom come over to our place to visit instead. When my mom would do that, he would always give me a full report of everything my mom did \u201cwrong\u201d or things she did that he didn\u2019t like. Nothing serious ever. My mom still works so when she gets time off and tries to spend time with the kids, my husband 9/10 times finds a reason to say no. \n\nA recent argument we had was about church. My mom would like to take my oldest to church every Sunday. He reluctantly agreed but stated that our LO had to be home As SOON as church ended so he could try to give LO a nap. My mom wanted to spend some time with LO after church so she offered to give a nap and bring LO home at 5. Bedtime is around 7:30/8. My husband said no bc LO would come home hype and needed time to decompress and so 2pm was the latest he could do. Yes LO comes home hype but LO is ALWAYS hype and it doesn\u2019t take 6 hours to calm down. \n\nMy husband\u2019s reasoning is he\u2019s home all by himself on weekends with both kids and therefore should be able to call the shots bc he has to manage both of them. \n\nHe would only have to deal with 1 child if he allowed my mom to take LO until 5pm. I even offered to put LO to bed when I got home at 8 but he wouldn\u2019t budge. We literally argued about this for 3 days!! He finally agreed though. We are in therapy and he\u2019s very slowly working things out. (Our therapist also believes he has control issues). \n\nMy mother on the other hand is a control freak also. She constantly changes plans and times with little notice and that is VERY inconvenient and annoying. She expects our lives to revolve around her constantly changing schedule. \n\nShe flipped out when she found out that my husband wasn\u2019t trying to give her an extra 3 hours on Sunday even though she volunteered to give a nap (she has even come in and gave LO a bath after drop off in the past). My husband will barely thank her for doing things like that to help him. \n\nShe thinks that my husband is very controlling and thus restricts the kids time with her bc of it. She also has told me that we don\u2019t respect her as a grandma and that she has \u201cgrandma rights\u201d and that she shouldn\u2019t have any rules placed upon her. \n\nMy mother asked for our oldest to go with her to the shore over the weekend and stayed that she already knows my husband will say no. When I asked my husband of course, he immediately said no. His reason is that LO\u2019s schedule will be messed up when going back to school the next day. I told him that my mom would give LO a nap, enforce the normal bedtime and will be home at 5 pm on Sunday like we agreed. He then started finding another reason to say no. It sucks bc our LO loves the beach and would have so much fun. My husband did admit safety with my mom is never a concern with him. \n\nIt\u2019s so weird bc my mom was extremely strict growing up and never ever let me go anywhere with no good reason either. I never wanted my kids to grow up like that. I have explained that to my husband and told him that the kids will resent him if he goes down that path of always saying no but it doesn\u2019t phase him.\n\nWhen I tell my husband that I want the kids to hang out with my family he states that it\u2019s my mother who\u2019s making me say that. When I tell my mother I want her to keep our kids on their schedule she says it\u2019s just my husband making me say that. I\u2019m stuck in the middle. \n\nI recently told my mom she needs to respect my husband and I as parents and abide by our rules whether she likes it or not and I told my husband he\u2019s just like my mom and needs to chill out and let the kids have fun. Both gave me lackluster answers and now there\u2019s an even bigger wedge in their relationship. What do I do?",

        "content": "FTM here to an almost 8 month old. Over the last few months my fianc\u00e9's mother has gotten increasingly annoying about her suggestions and recommendations regarding my baby and I just don't know how to handle it. At first, I would just politely smile and nod. But now it's gotten to the point that she **always** has some suggestion to make about my baby and her progress every time she sees us. Its low-key stressing me out and my fianc\u00e9 of course always stands up for his mom.   \nHe gets annoyed with me for being annoyed and tells me \"she's just a concerned grandma\" or \"she's just trying to be helpful\". \n\nTo give a few examples, grandma was pressing for me to feed the baby solids as soon as she hit 4 months old although she wasn't showing signs of being ready for them. Once baby was eating solids, grandma had concerns about me putting her in a highchair or placing baby in any seated position because it could damage her spine, even though baby has full head/neck control and could sit up with support. When baby got excited, she would simultaneously move her hands and feet and grandma practically *begged* us to have the pediatrician to assess the baby to see whether these actions were \"normal\" (turned out to be of no concern to her ped and was chalked up to be baby's way of expressing herself/her excitement). Now, grandma's recent concerns are with baby not spending time on the floor to do tummy time and the fact that baby does not sleep in her full-sized crib upstairs in her own room to practice pulling herself up by the crib bars (baby sleeps in her bassinet downstairs with us in the master bedroom). I do/supervise tummy time with the baby every single day on our bed where she's able to roll back and forth and can sit up on her own if I place her down on her butt. \n\nThe pediatrician has had zero concerns with my baby's development and the milestones she has reached so far. I've been a SAHM since baby was born due to not having passed a test to receive my license to work in my field. I do 99% of the parenting alone while my fianc\u00e9 works (which is whole other issue/ stress factor in itself) and he goes back and forth with his two older kids when he\u2019s not at work. This evening when he told me about his mom's concern about baby not sleeping in her crib, I asked him (with an annoyed tone) \"should we plan to move the baby's crib downstairs to our room this week, then?\". My fianc\u00e9 immediately got pissed and asked \"why do you have beef with my mom?\" and pretty much shut down and went to sleep. \n\nI have been with my fianc\u00e9 for 11 years. I practically watched his older kids and niece grow up into the teens/preteens they are today and I never saw his mother give as many unsolicited advice regarding them as she has been doing to me with my daughter. Of her 4 grandchildren, my daughter is the only grandchild who is being raised by both parents under one roof (my fianc\u00e9 and his brother were broken up with their kids\u2019 mothers before or shortly after birth). I feel like she is challenging my competence as a mother and it\u2019s gotten old. \n\nI\u2019ve always thought her to be a very nice woman until lately. I know I\u2019ve been under more stress than ever before with trying to achieve my licensing and becoming a new parent all at the same time, so I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m overreacting.

        "most_upvoted_comment": "> my fianc\u00e9 of course always stands up for his mom.\n\nNot sure why this is 'of course' - your fiance should be standing up for you and your daughter against his mom, because you're supposed to be a united team, together in raising your daughter.\n\n> This evening when he told me about his mom's concern\n\nYou shouldn't have to deal with your fiance's mom - that's your fiance's job. He should be stonewalling her here and not pass on his mom's remarks. A better question here is, does he have the same concern as his mom, or is he just being a useless telephone?\n\nHave you sat down with him and had a serious discussion about how you feel/think about his annoyance with you for being annoyed, his lack of support, etc. and how this is a dealbreaker? Have you considered whether your fiance's mom's remarks are actually directed at your fiance to step up to the plate, or actually directed to you? If it was to you, surely your fiance's mom doesn't need to use your fiance as a go between.\n\n> who is being raised by both parents under one roof\n\nBut your daughter isn't being raised by both parents. It's just you raising her 99% of the time (your words).\n\nIt sounds like your fiance needs to step up around your daughter and you. If you're together in a relationship, parenting shouldn't be solely on you. From your post, it doesn't sound like he sees you two as a unit yet. Many of the stress points stem from that first.\n\nTo explain further, you keep your good relationship with your fiance's mom by having your fiance be the person to address his own mom's concerns from his point of view, and leave you out of it. He can't rightly do that because he's not raising your daughter. If he was helping to raise her, he would know his mom's thoughts are unfounded.",

My ex-wife is deeply selfish, cheating, controlling ogre who looks out only for number one and sees everyone else only as a means to get what she wants.  She got our two sons and they have been mostly at her mercy.\n\nShe didn't teach my older son to drive.  She discouraged him from going to college of any kind.  She never encouraged him to get any jobs or have any ambition.  He's also deeply emotionally stunted.\n\nSome months before he turned 18, my son and I agreed that he would move in with me, and we would work together for him to get a job, I would help him get his DL, SS Card, and all the other things his mother has neglected.\n\nI am proud to say that we have moved forward in many of those areas.  We have gotten him his permit, and I am teaching him how to drive.  He has his first part-time job at Home Depot.  We have his birth certificate, Social Security Card, and he has a bank account and debit card.\n\nI check in with his general impressions and he says that since he's moved in with me, that his life is better, but he's still in this very dark place.  It's killing me because even before he moved in with me, I've been lonely and craving love and affection.  I had hoped that as time went by, he would be finding his way out of the darkness and becoming happpier and more personable, and three months later, and it's just not happening.\n\nI'm so emotionally tapped out with all this that the emotional pain that I experienced from my ex's cruelty and abuse is creeping back in.  He's clearly doing better in so many ways, but he's so wrapped up in his darkness and I don't know how to help him break free.  And it would help me so much.  I need a source of personal affection and I'm just struggling to have a good attitude and a sense of happiness, I'm pouring all this time and energy into getting my son up to speed into adulthood and having no intake for the emotional energy needed to keep this up.\n\nI don't know how to help him and I don't know how to keep my own spirits up.",

We lost 5 total, one of them when I was 6 months along. It was emotionally crippling. \nWe gave up, I went back on birth control and we attempted to move on...\n\u00a0 Then I got pregnant with my September 2020 baby out of the blue.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Through the pandemic I was terrified I'd get sick and loose her. (I was terrified I'd loose her regardless, COVID just added a new layer of stress) On top of that the isolation of lock down was difficult. I had a terrible pregnancy, sick all the time, considered high risk. But my husband wasn't allowed to come to appointments with me because of covid and I felt very alone. \n\n\u00a0 Fast forward... We now have a beautiful, healthy toddler. We couldn't be happier. And even though COVID still exists, it's not as frightening and isolating as it was so we can live a pretty normal life. \n\u00a0 I'm a SAHM now, something I dreamed about while having 3 jobs trying to raise my son... My husband works away from home, and long hours, my son is away at college. It's just me and LO most of the time. \n\nThe problem?\u00a0 I'm exhausted..... Like, so, so, so exhausted. My daughter is incredible but very needy/clingy.\u00a0 She sleeps well, but not long. She wakes up early, and her naps are short. By the time I get her in bed at night I'm so burnt out all I want to do is sit by myself in a quiet room. \n\u00a0\u00a0 We have no family close by. I have friends but they all work. \nRecently my friends were planning a girl's night.\u00a0 Excitedly I checked with my husband when he would be available to watch LO and gave them the dates.. They protested that they wanted my daughter to come along.\u00a0 And while I'm grateful they love my child and want to include her it literally made me cry. ALL I want is a break... I do not want to be in a restaurant where I am focused on keeping my child happy and entertained and eating, not able to enjoy the conversation or a drink. And we can't sit and chat because when she's done eating I'll need to go to avoid tantrum. \n\u00a0 I mentioned this to one friend and her response was \n\"But she's your miracle baby! You should be thankful you have her, why would you want to leave her at home?\" \n\u00a0 ANNNDDD... Cue the Guilt!!\ud83d\ude29\n\nI am beyond thankful I have her!!!. But I struggle so much with the lack of personal time. I don't remember it being this hard with my son. I don't know if it's because I was younger, or he was more easy going, or I was just so busy trying to survive that I didn't notice. \n\u00a0 But now I feel like I can't say anything or ask anyone for help, or else they'll think I'm just taking this wonderful miracle for granted.\u00a0 \n\u00a0 Am I too old for this? Not grateful enough? My daughter is a good kid. Why do I struggle so much? I feel just as alone as I did during lock down.\n\nNot even asking for advice, just venting.",

        "content": "I apologize for any errors or missing info... we're all quite sleep deprived. \n\nMy husband (38m) and I (37f) recently welcomed our second son into the world via emergency c section. The labour and birth were a bit traumatic, but we are doing better. \"Gabe\" is just over two weeks old now, and the last couple of days have been extra challenging. At first he ate and slept well, without any issues..  then he started fighting going to sleep.\n\nGabe has been having a hard time falling asleep after feeding. Were trying to pin down the reason(s) but are struggling to do so. We can hear his little guts churning sometimes. Other times he startles easily, and wakes himself up. He's clearly tired, but won't stay asleep... meaning we don't sleep. One of us gets up with him in order to try and keep him from crying and waking up the toddler (who is also struggling to adapt to the new changes, but that's another post entirely.)\n\nHe is a formula-fed baby due to circumstances beyond our control. I never produced well with our first, and with Gabe my milk never came in at all (despite great efforts). \n\nThings we've tried: \n- using Dr. Browns bottles to reduce air intake\n- switching formula from enfamil to enfamil gentlease (which he didn't like, so we switched back. We may revisit this one after last night though...)\n- swaddling for sleep time (usually helps, but not always the answer)\n- burping well (though he's a hard burper, and it doesn't always happen.)\n- keeping him upright after eating (usually about 20 minutes)\n- soother (if he takes it, it helps, but he wakes up as soon as it falls out... if he falls asleep without it  he stays asleep longer)\n- bicycle kicks and belly massages\n- ovol\n\nHe finally released a massive poop around 4 am, and we thought that would be the key, but he was still over tired by that point. Our toddler (2m) wakes up every day at 6 am, so between the two kids, we have very little downtime. Family help is unavailable, and we've already reached out and used friends when we can, but they're busy with their own lives. We scrape by each day, praying for a chance to get some sleep. We feel like we're at our limits, and have both expressed regret at having another child. We are both seeking counseling to talk about these (likely PP) feelings.\n\nNext week should offer some relief, as our toddler will be at his day home during the day, so we can both hopefully get some sleep in with just one kid to balance.\n\nEven while I write this, Gabe barely fell asleep, then while upright, spit up through his nose and mouth, woke up, and is upset again. We never encountered anything like this with our first. \n\nIs there something else we can try? Ride it out? Advice is welcome and appreciated. TIA.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Sounds like he has reflux. How often does he throw up? Does he cry a lot? \n\nAt that age it is a lot of things and they\u2019re too young for doctor to try and diagnose anything. But reflux is something to look out for. He might just need a formula change or be put on meds. Talk to your pediatrician. Apparently they even have a \u201ctest\u201d they can do to check your kid for this. \n\nMy child had reflux and needed specialty formula to control it. A very thick type of formula called Enfamil AR.\n\nIf your older kid is going to daycare next week that will give you time to solve this issue. Take down notes on how many hours the baby sleeps and if it is significantly less than the average, it is another piece of evidence that you can take to the pediatrician.\n\nI suggest getting medical professionals involve if it continues. There are solutions to problems if they can figure out what\u2019s making the baby upset. It took until month 6 for my kid to control his reflux. He was a very cranky newborn and barely slept. It is a long road ahead and sleep deprivation is no joke. Try everything before you give up and ride it out. Because having to ride it out is a real possibility.",

I finally left this awful relationship and was starting to heal. Then I got that positive pregnancy test and he was back in my life. \n\nI planned to have an abortion and not tell him but I couldn\u2019t go through with it. I considered adoption but had overwhelming support when I told my family I was pregnant. I was really convinced everything would be okay. My eldest sister even brought up adoption from herself. \n\n*I have BPD I am aware of this and in treatment but I am nowhere near recovered, my therapist definitely made adoption seem like the best idea but my family didn\u2019t support it. Before this pregnancy I didn\u2019t even think I would have children because of my mental handicaps. I was on birth control and took plan b to prevent this but it didn\u2019t work.*\n\nMy pregnancy was traumatic and extremely difficult. My ex stole money from me and his emotional and physical abuse was the most extreme at this time. Our relationship ended officially not long after our son was born. He\u2019s not listed on the birth certificates and I\u2019m going to do whatever it takes to keep him away from his father. (The man literally tried to kill me, I don\u2019t feel guilty for \u201ctaking his son away from him\u201d)\n\nSince he\u2019s been born my support system has slowly dwindled and I am beginning to fall apart. I have tried and tried to be a mother and I\u2019m just unfit. I knew this from the beginning but was convinced I would have more support than what I\u2019ve received. \nMy mother has been my biggest advocate but I can tell she\u2019s tired and she\u2019s expressed how frustrated she is with family for not stepping up when they said they would. \n\nI picked up a full time serving job shortly after he was born and I do pay my mother for helping but it is hard when I\u2019m still trying to take care of myself and have no assistance from his father. I am exhausted mentally and on the verge of a mental breakdown. I had to leave work the other day because I was on the verge of tears when I came in and just couldn\u2019t hold myself together. I have been looking into admitting myself because I am struggling to even get myself out of the house for basic tasks at this point. \n\nAnd to anyone who feels sorry for my son I truly get it. I wish he had more stability than he has but he is not neglected and he is very well loved. Almost every week he\u2019s off to the park, aquarium, zoo, water park. He is well fed and never in soiled clothes and has a wonderful place to live. His cousins are over often and already has friends to play with. This is all coming from me and my mother. And while I\u2019m proud I\u2019ve been able to support this life for him so far I know I\u2019m unable to keep up. I\u2019m truly surprised the burn out didn\u2019t come quicker. My mom has been his main caretaker and she\u2019s done a wonderful job but I\u2019ve become so depressed because I can tell she\u2019s so tired. I truly can\u2019t do anything more in fact I am fearing I will lose my job if I don\u2019t focus on myself more. (When I say that I mean being more consistent with therapy and my own physical health) I truly can\u2019t care for myself and another human being. It\u2019s the worst feeling on the planet but Im not surprised I\u2019m feeling this way. I knew I wouldn\u2019t be capable and the rest of my family has just dipped out. I don\u2019t know the solution here but I love my son enough to do something drastic If it\u2019s in his best interest. I wish I was able to be that powerful single mother but the harder I try the more I begin to crack. \n\nI\u2019ve had one friend my age who was raised by her grandparents and still has a wonderful relationship with her mom. I don\u2019t know all the details but I can tell there are some similarities as to why her mom wasn\u2019t her main caretaker. The biggest difference was that her grandparents actually had a lot of money and that was never a huge stressor for them unlike my family.\n\nI don\u2019t want to mess my child up and I don\u2019t want to burn my mother out. My mom has been very honest with that she\u2019s not angry with me and doesn\u2019t resent my decision to follow through with my pregnancy. Her frustration is with the family members who offered significant support and have not lived up to their word. My mother offered to take custody of I\u2019m from me if I feel that Is for the best and I\u2019m leaning that way.\n\nThis is a bit of a venting session but I also feel ready to hear other people\u2019s opinions on this matter. The people who have known me the longest have urged me to not beat myself up in this situation but I know I am being judged by others that don\u2019t know me so well (coworkers mainly) \n\nI feel like a god awful human being. I\u2019ve tried so hard but I knew from the beginning I was not cut out for this. But now I look at my son and I can\u2019t help but cry because I love him so dearly but can\u2019t be what he deserves. \n\nI know this is incredibly depressing but I need to know what others think of this matter now that I am putting it all out in the open.",

However it\u2019s incredibly difficult to watch him treat our child with what seems like contempt and disdain. It\u2019s affecting how I feel about him as a father and a husband. I\u2019m worried about the lasting damage this will have on our marriage.

        "content": "Howdy folks. I still feel like I'm a kid compared to the majority of this sub, but due to a complicated series of events, my daughter was born a couple months ago to my ex (19F) who lives several states away. Short backstory, I met the ex at college while not mentally in a great spot. She could be generously described as emotionally abusive and pathologically dishonest. Relationship lasted the first semester pretty much, during which I found out that she had deliberately gotten off birth control to get pregnant. We finally broke up a couple months after that when she encouraged me to commit suicide while I was in a really low spot. I dropped out of university, moved back home, started going to therapy, and got a couple jobs while going to community college to get my EMT certification since I still wanted to do everything I could for my daughter, despite being woefully unprepared.\n\nThat's the backstory, on to the main story. Like I said, my daughter was born a couple months ago, and she is the most amazing and most adorable little girl to ever exist. My ex's parents convinced her to let me visit a couple times to be able to meet my daughter, but I've hit a stone wall as far as getting her to even talk about making some kind of custody agreement where I got any custody. And the worst part is, she's not even doing any of the parenting as far as I can tell. From everything I've seen while visiting and from talking to her parents, it's her parents who are taking care of my daughter, not my ex. Part of me is happy about that because they're a lot more trustworthy than she is, but now they're attached to my daughter and don't want me to get custody either. I'm already sending child support money voluntarily since ex doesn't have a job, and I managed to scrape together enough money to get an attorney to start a court process, but other than that I'm not sure what else I can do right now. I also don't know what I can really do to try to connect with and take care of my daughter while I'm sitting here waiting for this custody battle to battle. I just feel so helpless since my baby girl is with her psycho mom who mostly seems to want to use my daughter to either get back at me or get back with me. Any advice you kind experienced parents of Reddit can give me would be much appreciated.\n\nAnd if anyone's wondering about the account so new that it still has a warranty, it's because said ex stalks my main Reddit account. Go figure.\n\nTL;DR: 19yo dad, starting custody battle with crazy ex. Help please, I don't know how to adult.\n\nMy apologies if wrong flair, I don't know if the advice flair is for asking for advice or offering advice.",

Please don't feel that you have to put a brace face on when you're struggling. Opening up to people will be so helpful for reminding you that you're not alone and for getting yourself some help.

Between 2014 and 2018 I was diagnosed with PCOS, hypothyroidism, and a minor genetic heart defect (weakened mitral valve which will likely prolapse like my grandfather's had.) My doctors were happy to blame my weight struggles on my conditions and were hopeful various treatments would make weight loss easier but never really did. Then I was diagnosed with an ovarian tumor which destroyed my ovary and had to be surgically removed. After healing I was angry and depressed. I hated my body and starved myself as punishment and to feel like I had control over literally anything at this point. Over the course of about 6 months this evolved into intentional and medically monitored fasting with INTENSE exercise. (I dedicated hours of everyday to a gym routine with little rest.) I managed to get down to 160 for the first time in my life since being 12... AND THEN I GOT PREGNANT (we were certain after 10 years of marriage and one ovary I was officially infertile) \n\nObviously, I gained everything back haha. Not immediately mind you: I was about 170 after giving birth and within two years I was back up to 220. During this time the pandemic hit, we went medically bankrupt, moved in with family, and completely started over from scratch in a different state. People (including my doctors) who know me just sympathetically explain it away as getting hit with a truckload of shit and stress and that it just makes sense \"considering.\"\n\nWell, now at 2.75 years since our awesome little dude's arrival, I am 240 and just started a new job that is 100% sitting at a desk all day. I can't... I can't just willing go down this path to being 300+ pounds and unable to play with my son... \n\nI need help creating a healthy routine around being an exhausted, broke, parent who works full time at a computer desk and then dedicates the rest of her time to her son.\n\nMy schedule is 7:30am get ready and drop the tot off at daycare. 8-5 work 5:30 pick up the tot and cook dinner. 6 or 6:30 eat dinner. 7pm - 8pm bath/bedtime routine. 8:30 - 10 sit and cry into couch. 10 bed. I have weekends off and we dedicate this time fully to our son and a few chores.\n\nI don't eat breakfast, I don't often eat lunch, I eat dinner and am bad at night time snacking which I need to actively stop. My new job is a 10 minute drive (30 on a bicycle, 1.5 hour walk) and not located near any fast food which is good. I get a half an hour lunch.

I have packed away both my kids clothes and younger toys and everything with the intent to use them again. My husband on the other hand, after our second said he was done after two. I would always throw in little comments about having a third. Well, we had a long discussion recently and he basically said he doesn\u2019t mind the idea of a 3rd and he\u2019ll go for it because he doesn\u2019t want me to regret it. \n\nNow this is the problem.

We weren\u2019t trying and we weren\u2019t using any birth control, so it happened. I am not naive to how babies are made and I had warned him that I wouldn\u2019t be getting another abortion (had one previously a few years back with him), but he felt confident in his pull out game.\n\nSo I decided to keep my baby and he was upset by this and we separated for a few of months. During this time, I was very depressed and didn\u2019t enjoy my pregnancy at all. I stayed in bed and cried almost every day. I had support from family and friends, but there\u2019s nothing like the support of your partner and I didn\u2019t have it.\n\nWe had many conversations and I had told him that I\u2019d be willing to go through the pregnancy alone, take care of my baby alone and he didn\u2019t need to be a part of our lives if that was what he chose to do. He maintained that I betrayed his trust and he couldn\u2019t forgive me, that I was selfish for not letting my child have two \u201cwilling\u201d parents and inconsiderate of his feelings. During the month of my due date, I asked him what his role would be when it comes to her, and he said to act like I\u2019m a single mother and anything he did would be a bonus. \n\nOur baby is six months old now and we\u2019ve been trying to work on our relationship since my third trimester. He  claims he loves our daughter but he harbours a lot of feelings of resentment and mistrust towards me, and I try to understand those feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, I have some negative feelings as well since I didn\u2019t get to enjoy my pregnancy as I thought I would as it was a very depressing time for me, going through such emotional turmoil and feelings of uncertainty when it came to our relationship. Every time I even think about the last year even for a second, it brings tears to my eyes. I barely have any photos during that time, I barely left the house and I didn\u2019t even celebrate it how I\u2019d like from just being depressed and ashamed.\n\nI am so regretful that I let this overshadow the beauty and joy that my pregnancy could\u2019ve brought me. When I bring up how I feel, he makes comments like \u201cwell you wanted this (our baby) knowing how I felt\u201d and \u201cI warned you that this would be how I felt (detached and withdrawn), so I don\u2019t bring up my feelings often and that makes me feel alone.\n\nWe started couple\u2019s therapy to help resolve his feelings and it has lead me down a path of sadness as I recount how I felt and still feel. He doesn\u2019t validate my feelings and it hurts me. I spend most of our session and our time debriefing afterwards crying. He doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s productive because I shouldn\u2019t still be so deeply sadden and tearful. I\u2019ve done individual therapy before and I spent a lot of time crying in it too as the trauma was raw and similarly to this, the emotions are just under the surface and not being dealt with. He ended the therapy after two sessions because it wasn\u2019t working fast enough /s\n\nHe didn\u2019t contribute anything during my pregnancy and has given me a total of $300 after I asked for help and one pack of newborn diapers in February when I asked if he could bring it for me. Otherwise he makes a big stink of having any financial responsibility towards her because he didn\u2019t \u201cask\u201d to be in this situation. He is financially well off and he withholds money as a punishment when he\u2019s upset. I also have a great paying career that\u2019s allowed me to live comfortably on my 18-month maternity leave that ends next year. \n\nLast week when I took her to get her ears pierced, he wanted to come. He got to the mall before me, bought himself some shoes and then hung out with us once we got there. A few days after, I asked him why he never gets anything for the baby. He said he\u2019s not going to be pressured by me into giving money for the baby and he\u2019s not going to compromise himself (read: giving me money lessens the money he has to spend on himself) so he can enjoy his life. He also said the most important thing is that my daughter is loved because \u201cshe\u2019s innocent in all of this\u201d and that they have a relationship and I need to stop making things about money. \n\nHe sees her once a week or every two weeks as long as we\u2019re on good terms, sometimes more if he\u2019s really happy that week. If he\u2019s mad at me, he won\u2019t come see her. He said he just wants to have fun and enjoy his life. \"I don't want to do the maintenance..the diapers, the feeding and burping. I rather give you money for fun stuff like her birthday party than for maintenance.\u201d I told him that we're in a relationship and I shouldn't be expected to take the brunt of the work. \n\nHe asked me if I were to date someone new if they\u2019d be expected to take care of my daughter. I said of course not, she\u2019s not theirs. He\u2019s like \u201clucky guy\u201d.

I\u2019ve never seen this side of him before and if I did, I\u2019d have taken better precautions. I love/d this man, thought we would\u2019ve had a happy life together, and he would\u2019ve been a great father. I know he told me he didn\u2019t want my baby, but I didn\u2019t think he would try to be with while actively trying not to take care of our baby. Am I asking for too much?\n\nUPDATE! \n1. Thank you all for the comments of advice and kind words that I received. I appreciate them so much \n2. I\u2019ve ended things with him. We haven\u2019t come to an agreement on visitation & he\u2019s refusing to help financially \n3.

He was very manipulative and controlling and did not respect me or my feelings about fighting in front of my autistic son (6yo). He would get in my face and scream at me no matter how many times i told him to stop doing it in front of my son. I tried to make him move out of my apartment but he refused and i didnt know what to do at the time so he stayed. That was 2 years ago just after i got pregnant with our daughter, who is one now. He left bruises on my son from spanking him too hard twice. Again i didnt know what to do. \n\nWe split soon after the second time. I ended up getting a protective order for harassment bc he would call me 72 times in one day and made 3 facebooks and 15 different phone numbers just to keep yelling at me. Now i live an hour away. He doesnt drive and my car is broke down. Im borrowing my dads van but its a shitbox and i have been given the stipulation i cannot use it to take my daughter to see her father. Hes on her birth certificate but has no legally established rights (we live in Indiana). I went against the protective order to allow him to see our daughter and video chat with her. It was going well and we were starting to be friendly again but then he snapped again. Started trying to manipulate me into taking our daughter to see him even though i have absolutely no way of doing so. He wants me to let him take her alone but i do not feel safe doing so whatsoever. He was getting explosive again so i blocked him. \n\nShould i keep him blocked to protect myself from his manipulation or is it wrong to prevent him from seeing our daughter by doing that? Ive heard of parallel parenting instead of coparenting but i dont know how to do that when i wont allow him to take our daughter by himself. I will not pursue a legal solution unless he files for rights because of his abusive tendencies. (Im not asking for legal advice, im asking opinions on the morality i suppose of blocking my ex to protect myself and not allowing a relationship between him and our daughter by doing so)",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "If he wants to see his kid, and get in the right headset to do so safely, he will pursue a custody agreement or visitation rights in court. He probably qualifies for legal aid if your state has it, sounds like he doesn\u2019t have much income coming in if he has time to call you 70 times, be a stalker and doesn\u2019t drive. He won\u2019t go to court though, because he doesn\u2019t really care and isn\u2019t ready to change his life or take responsibility for his decisions and mistakes. My guess is the kid is just a means to you. He cares about having power and control of you and wants to use the kid to get it. If you put your daughter in danger by being alone with an abusive person, you\u2019re risking a whole lot of chaos. Child abuse, withholding the child from you as a power tactic, neglectful parenting, to name a few. Don\u2019t do it. Most likely he wants to not give your daughter back to emotionally torture you into some manipulative stunt to get you engaged and back in his life. Stay away. \n\nIf he cleans his act up and can have a lot of normal healthy conversations with you in the future after he\u2019s gotten therapy and his life together, start with visits that a 3rd party can facilitate. Not you. Maybe your mom or dad or a social worker. If those go well for a long time, move to visits without supervision for short periods of time. My guess is he won\u2019t have the patience to go through this and will give up and find another girl to harass and abuse, but I hope I\u2019m wrong. \n\nKeep yourself and your kids safe.

You may never like children and you may regret your choices, but therapy can help you figure out how to adjust to your situation without damaging your kids or spiraling further into depression. Please consider getting that help. A good therapist is going to get where you're coming from and won't judge you. A lot of people out there don't like kids much in general, but love their kids in particular. You can get to a place where life is better, too.

Someone to talk to! \n\nI was with my boyfriend for almost 8 years. My birth control failed and I got pregnant in 2020. He was over the moon about it. He always wanted to be a dad but I kept saying I wasn\u2019t sure I was ready. I taught preschool At the time and loved kids, but they exhaust me. Anyways, I went through with the pregnancy and my son is now almost 1. Of course it was HARD. I quit my job to be a stay at home mom. He worked a lot. The baby cried. We didn\u2019t have time for each other like we used to. Thankfully grandma takes the baby on Fridays and we used to have date night. It started changing over the last few months. He would tell me he was working late. He works a regular day job but also has a music studio as a hobby that him and his friends do stay at late. He\u2019s never been a ladies man/woman chaser type and I\u2019ve never been jealous so I never thought anything Of it. Then it was more and more common for him to stay out until 2 am. I started to get MAD because you can\u2019t keep doing that every weekend when ur a dad and also-where are you?!\n\nAnyways, 3 weeks ago he tells me he\u2019s going out of town for work. He was texting the whole time he was away saying how he missed me and couldn\u2019t wait to be home. Then come Sunday he ghosted me and never came home. I finally showed up at his work Monday and he got in the car and talked to me and said he can\u2019t do this he\u2019s so stressed at the house between me and the baby and I don\u2019t have to go back to work he will still support me financially and he still loves me he just need to be alone. My whole world came crashing down. \n\nHe has a lot of childhood trauma and ptsd he never dealt with from his own mother abandoning him as a baby and his father dying. He always said he wanted a family to make up for the one he never had. But now he\u2019s doing the exact same thing his mom did. The first few days he kept in contact asking how our son was-and he paid the rent and bills. But lately I haven\u2019t heard a word from him. I don\u2019t message him because I\u2019m going no contact. If he wants to see our son, he can initiate it.\n\nMy mind is just going crazy. He was so in love with our family. I just keep thinking about him being with another woman. It makes me sick.If he is with someone else, I hope he does just stay away for now. I know that sounds awful but I can\u2019t fathom letting him take my son and go play house with her when I never even got that happy family house with him since the first year was so hard. I had postpartum depression and he worked so much. I believe in God and I keep praying for him. That whatever he\u2019s going through will end and he will come home. I know a lot of you will say I\u2019m better off without him, but this is so out of character for him. I just want my family back. \n\nSorry if there\u2019s any typos-I don\u2019t feel like going back and proofreading!",

This is going to be long and messy--because I'm a fucking mess right now--so TYIA to anyone who makes it to the end and responds.\n\nI have struggled with anxiety disorders all my life and with depression for most of my life. I am medicated for both. I have received counseling for both, although I'm not currently in therapy.\n\nSince my youngest was born, I just haven't been OK. I can barely control my anger towards my kids and I yell at them and get rough with them--primarily the 5yo--too often. It feels like my whole body is on fire and I grab a hand too hard or swat an arm or push a little too hard to get someone out the door/into the house, whatever it is. I know it's wrong. I know it makes things worse for everyone. If you're going to reply with links to studies about the damage I'm doing every time I lash out, save yourself the trouble because I have read them already and I know. I fucking know it's wrong.\n\nBut I just can't seem to control the anger.\n\nMy dad was never able to control his either. He hurt me physically and emotionally. I'm not sure if he knew it was wrong. At the time, he blamed it on me and how difficult I was. We are not close now, and I don't really want to dive into my parents because this is about me trying desperately to do better for my kids (and still failing).\n\nWhen 3yo was about 8mo, the rage I was experiencing was diagnosed as Postpartum Anxiety. I started a mood stabilizer to cope with it and started running. Then came a pandemic. Eventually I also added weekly therapy to the mix (via video chat).\n\nThings seemed to improve some, for a while, for the most part. But then my menstrual cycle came back after 18 months of lactational amenorrhea, and my moods started to shift again. This time the anger seemed especially unbearable in the week before my period, so I was diagnosed with Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder. I worked with my psychiatrist to adjust my anti-anxiety meds again, but it still wasn't enough. I talked to my OB/GYN and started taking birth control continuously to try to suppress my cycle and therefore the PMDD. I'm only on the 2nd month of this approach, so it's too soon to say if it works.\n\nBut in the meantime, while I wait for doctors' appointments and tinker with medications, my kids continue to suffer every time I lash out. I hate myself for it. I often wonder if they would be better off without me in their lives, that's how I'm afraid I am of my anger harming them.\n\nI apologize every time I lash out. I have explained my mental health struggles in an age-appropriate way and tried to make it clear that this is not their fault, that I am still learning to control my emotions, just like they are, but I know it's not enough.\n\nI try so hard to control it--primarily with medication and exercise--and I feel like I'm failing anyway.\n\nI don't know what I'm looking for here. Maybe just some encouragement, especially from someone who has been through something like this. Tell me how you got out, please. I guess I'm just looking for a little hope that I can make things better for myself, but especially for them.\n\nThey deserve so much better than me.",

She's extremely manipulative, and even now she says things that are just genuinely not ok, even though we've set a lot of boundaries and agreed that she she has no control over anything in my life. I always believed that if I had a kid of my own I would eventually end up being exactly like her. \n\nFast forward to my mid 20s, I met a guy that I fell in love with. I've always made it clear to any serious partner that I wasn't interested in ever having kids, and if it wasn't ok with them we went our separate ways. When I told this guy though, he told me that was completely ok and that he still wanted to see where the relationship went. We dated for a while, got engaged, and genuinely had a great, happy relationship. \n\nThen comes the day I found out I was pregnant. My period was late and I decided I should take a pregnancy test. Obviously it came back positive. Hoping that it was just a false positive, I took about 6 more. All came back with the same result. I broke the news to him and we sat down and talked about what we were going to do. He was delighted, which wasn't exactly the response I was expecting considering our previous conversation about not having children. I, of course, was not. We talked about it every day for about a week to decide if we were going to keep the child or not, and I eventually came to the conclusion that I didn't think I could go through with an abortion, so we kept it. It turned out to be a he, and over the next few months I truly felt like maybe I actually would be ok with this after all. I started feeling a little bit of motherly love for this tiny human growing inside me and hoped that everything would end up working out. \n\nI gave up a job that I had gotten that I truly loved because we realized about halfway through the pregnancy that we couldn't do this without some sort of family to help us. He was able to keep his career that he loved, but I had to give mine up; it just didn't work with our schedule. I've dealt with depression my whole life, and it only got worse the longer I was pregnant, accumulating when I gave birth. It didn't help that I went through some of the worst pain of my life after having an episiotomy, and that ever since I hate my body and how I look no matter how hard I try to get back to where I used to be. \n\nLet me make one thing clear at this point. I DO love my son (I'm not a cold hearted b\\*tch) but I hate being a parent, and I'm sure a tiny part of me does have some resentment towards my fianc\u00e9 and son. I gave up my career, my friends, my hobbies, my body, my self-confidence, and my life to have something that I never actually wanted. I do everything in my power to make sure he has everything he needs, and try my best to give him all the love that I can, however it's just so hard. I have very little patience for all the things that come with having a child. I've sought treatment for my depression and ended up getting diagnosed with PPD and Bipolar Disorder and am currently getting treatment for those as well. But nothing I do, and nothing anyone says has been able to change my mind towards my son or being a mother in general. \n\nNo matter how hard I try, or what I do, I can't shake this feeling of still not really wanting to be a parent. I guess I'm just wondering \"What do I do?\" He's so loved by all my family, by his dad and his family, and by all of our friends as well. Do these feelings make me a terrible person? How do I learn to love being a parent, and how can I make this work?

My wife and I met him about 3 months in, and thought he was kind of quiet, but generally seemed like a good guy. We saw them sporadically over the next several months, and the one thing that struck us as odd was that he was always wearing THE EXACT SAME CLOTHES. The same t-shirt, same hoodie, same dark watch cap, and same plaid wool vest looking thing. Every time. We began to wonder if he had any other clothes. This is relevant as will become clear later.\nIn September, 6 months in, they broke up over him being to possessive, she hugged a male friend of nine years and he didn\u2019t like it, and children/birth control. They were apart for 5 weeks during which he went to 1 counseling session, and then they got back together.\nEngaged in October, wedding planned for June, but inexplicably moved up to January.\nFor Thanksgiving my daughter then 26 and her sister then 28 and a group of close friends got together for \u201cFriendsgiving\u201d.  This was when her close circle of friends got to spend some time with the newly engaged couple.\nIt did not go well. The son-in-law (we\u2019ll call him John ) apparently spoke of nothing but Theology and scripture. For hours. He was according to my other daughter overbearing and rude and basically alienated the group. \nOne last bit. My wife\u2019s parents live 7 houses away from us. We as a family, make it a point to have lunch every Sunday at their house, because her mom is not in good health. 7 houses away.\nNow to post wedding.\nMarried in late January.\nIn early March we were informed that my daughter (we\u2019ll call her Jane ) and her new husband would no longer be attending family dinner on Sunday. Their Sunday\u2019s had become too busy with church in the morning and then again at night. They instead would come see her grandparents on Friday afternoon instead. Notice I said grandparents, no mention of the parents 7 houses away.\nMy wife was devastated. Sunday lunch was a tradition literally since the girls were born, before we lived 7 houses away. Her dad was devastated but would never say anything.\nThey went the first Friday after the announcement, skipped 7 and then went yesterday because they were headed out of town, and because my other daughter stepped in and told her they had not lived up to their promise, and they needed to go see them before they left town. \nSo visit, skip 7 weeks, another visit. Grandparents. Just grandparents. No visit 7 houses down the road.\nSince the wedding, they quit the church that we have attended for the last  7 years. The church where my daughter was head of the young adults music program. They got married at the church on a Saturday and never went back. They found a new ultra conservative small church. They go twice on Sunday. There is also a couples thing they go to, and my daughter hosts a bible study group during the week. And that is all they do. They do nothing socially outside of the church. \nMy daughter is an incredibly talented musician. She gets it from her mom who teaches piano for a living.\nMy daughter used to play at local coffee shops and cafes. She has always been the social butterfly of the two girls. Growing up she was Ariel her sister was Belle. She is Anna, her sister Elsa.\nMy son-in-law has not been in our house since the wedding. My daughter has been in the house twice to get her mail. He sat in the car both times. My daughter has called her mother once since the wedding.\nMy wife is beside herself. We talk to our other daughter at least three times a week. And she calls us. \nThe son-in-law now dresses in jacket tie sweater vest slacks and dress shoes, all the time! Everywhere! At the beach!\nWe feel like he is using religion as a weapon. If it\u2019s not church based, they don\u2019t do it.\nHelp! We are losing touch with her, because he is now completely in control. \nIn the vows she agreed to submit to him as head of the house. \nWe want to say something but it\u2019s so early.\nHelp!",

The brainwashing is pretty effective on people if they have already been taught to follow religion and not to think for themselves, but hopefully that\u2019s not the case with her.",

The first time I had an abortion. It was difficult but I was confident in my decision. This time, I'm much more reluctant. It was a terrible experience and one I really hoped to never have again.\n\nI've always wanted more children (I have one). My existing child talks about getting a sibling all of the time, and I've feared that it's been \"too late\" for awhile...but here we are again.

The benefits you see to giving your child a sibling might not be realized until adulthood.\n\nThe point of this post is not to talk you out of having the baby (you already know the reasons against it), it's just to highlight that your focus is on yourself. Your focus needs to be on your first child and you as a unit. This needs to benefit everyone in the family.",

        "content": "So I\u2019m a single fresh 18year old mum to my 17month old son with mommy issues. Honestly at this point I don\u2019t know what the purpose of my existence is whenever my mum is around. \nAfter giving birth to my son I took full responsibility up until 8months when I went back to work and study. By that time my mum allowed me to move out but wanted me to leave my son to her because she didn\u2019t have hope that I\u2019d be able to take care of him by myself along with my gay best friend. \n\nFirst I was hurt that she didn\u2019t believe in my independence then finally I came around and agreed, I chose to move out because my relationship with her wasn\u2019t great under the same roof, since she\u2019s abit bipolar but doesn\u2019t wanna admit it. She always had something negative to say on any opinion and very controlling. I couldn\u2019t stand the fights we\u2019d have almost every second night it was draining physically and mentally. The expectations she had from me a young teen mum who\u2019s role is be both mum and dad to my son. Anyways as you can tell mommy issues. \n\nFast forward I lived alone for a while I went through bumpy roads and forgot the whole point of why I moved out. It was nice being free from being a Mumma for awhile because back then I used to feel so locked up like I was in prison waking up to the same routine everyday and every night I\u2019d cry myself to sleep because of all the pressure I\u2019d receive around me so I took advantage of my mums words and I started seeing my child lesser now. \nLittle did I know that the life I \u2018wanted\u2019 changed. Time flew and my relation with my son dramatically changed. Every time I came to visit he\u2019d look at me like \u201cwho the fuck is this woman\u201d\nIt was painful because I missed his first steps his first \u201cmama\u201d everything. The worst part was when I was living alone my mum didn\u2019t even teach him that I\u2019m his Mumma. No calls no pics or vids.\nAt the end I tried to rebuild my relationship with my boy I know it\u2019s my fault he is the way he is. My boy calls me by my name because no one calls me Mumma around him. I\u2019m jealous really jealous. I\u2019ve moved back in with my mum then but being here is draining me mentally. She complains I don\u2019t do my part as a mum when she never lets me.. \nwhen he cries i try my best to comfort him and be his mum but she\u2019s always running down to \u2018help\u2019 like how am I suppose to be his mum if you\u2019re not letting me. When it comes to her there\u2019s no tantrums there\u2019s only smiles and hugs. I\u2019m so jealous because I want all that. I want him to run and hug me tight like he does with her. I know it\u2019s my fault but she isn\u2019t giving me a chance to make things right.\nShe always guilt trips me man. My own son calls her mama it hurts hearing that. I know now my life is different from every other teen but I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. I was a rape victim at 16 and now a single mum.\nWhat more can I offer? I just wanna be called Mumma and I\u2019m doing the best I can\nSorry just venting my feelings",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "I think first thing you need to do is get some therapy or counseling, you have issues that will interfere with your ability to do stuff like be there for your son until you address them. I know it's hard but I think it needs to happen. \n\nMy mum also rushes to the rescue, or tries to but I just get there quicker and tell her that I have it covered in a tone that says I'm not taking her shit at all rn. \n\nI know this is a sensitive thing to ask, but is your son the result of that rape? \n\nIs there any reason you couldn't have given your son up for adoption? What I'm gathering is that your mum seemed to make you keep this child when you didn't want to. I'm not saying that's the case but that's the vibe I'm getting. \n\nAbove all else you need to have a chat with your mum, with someone to mediate, and lay down your thoughts to her. The mediator can make sure you both listen and give each other the chance to speak. \n\nYour mother is undermining you, but you did leave. You should not have let her bulldoze decisions like that but instead of outright leaving, you could have tried just taking on anything household related to you and your son. I know it's suffocating, I'm in a similar position in terms of my mother, but I'm learning by being more assertive, I'm learning what I can and can't do on my own. There are something's I do, like state I don't want to eat yet, I'll make something later when I'm ready then following through with that. Being assertive about that alone has helped my mum back off a little bit. Maybe give it a go.",

That adds a whole other layer of crap to it. I plan on approaching it with communication versus control.

I approached it just as a \"since you are in a serious relationship, and I'm not so naive as to think it isn't a possibility, so if/when you have sex be thoughtful and careful.\" I told him I would buy whatever he/she needed to be safe.

        "content": "Apologies for the title. I've been sitting here for ages trying to figure out what to title this.\n\nHello all. I havent been active in over six months, and now I'm back. I made a lot of posts over a couple months, mostly in a haze. I honestly dont remember making half of them.\n\nThe gist is I was struggling immensely with two delayed toddlers, two high needs premature infants and, at the end, an accidental pregnancy. I struggled with some severe mental health issues I didnt want to admit. \n\nBreakdown; I made a post about having an abortion. I debated back and forth. We wanted the baby but didn't know if we would cope. After a decent amount of rightful shaming I decided I'd log off because clearly no one actually cared that I was struggling. Despite literally all of you telling me I was struggling and needed to get help. Apologies. \n\nWe opted for an abortion. Drove to the clinic, I had what can only be described as a breakdown in the parking lot. The pro lifers probably didnt help. We cancelled, got back in the car and went home. My husband was really worried at that point, obviously. \n\nAfter a couple more weeks of awful mental health he decided I needed help. This wouldnt be a situation I could just push through like usual. I was pretty angry initally, but we did it. I was diagnosed with both depression and anxiety. Still pregnant so no meds, but therapy works wonders.\n\nOver the past four months both my daughters have been diagnosed autistic. After that I was then diagnosed autistic, which honestly explains a lot. One of my sons was diagnosed with cerbal palsy, and both are in physical therapy. \n\nI had a small breakdown after they told me my son may never walk or crawl which landed me in inpatient about six weeks ago. That led to a very recent PTSD diagnosis. I am still working massively to help myself, as best I can with therapy. \n\nAll four of the kids are in therapy too.  Occupational and speech for all four, physical for the boys. \n\nI have not yet worked through my birth control anxiety but my husband has had a vasectomy so no more surprises. I am tackling my anxiety surrounding childcare workers. I am still a fulltime SAHM, but I do have a cleaner come by every few days to help me catch up. \n\nHubs' boss has moved him to more paperwork so he can work from home half the time which has been amazing. Him being home has improved the girls behaviour tenfold.\n\nNow the boys are on solids they are sleeping for three to four hour stretches. I am still nursing all four, which I feel some may be upset about, but my supply is fine. Its been a bit difficult unable to pump during pregnancy but its not been impossible. \n\nSo, here we are. My girls will turn three and four next month. The boys turned one in April, and this baby is due in July. I'm currently twenty nine weeks along. We're having another girl, which is exciting.\n\nThe dog was given the all clear from the vets last week! His cancer is gone (again). Yesterday my husband recieved a call saying we can finally move back into our home.\n\nWe havent lived there for eleven months, so he's talking about selling and moving to a bigger place more rural, but thats a discussion for the future. We've also officially upgraded to a van! The carseat situation just wasnt working out. I think my husband is still salty about that one.\n\nI thought you guys ought to know. You definitely played a part in pushing me to get the help for myself and my children. So thank you.",

        "content": "I have a 4 year old and a 3 year old. My 3 year old is high support needs autistic and he also has Eosinophilic esophagitis. \n\nMy son has had a difficult time since birth.  He had to be hospitalized at 3 days old due to him refusing to eat and being jaundice. He had to be put on special formula and the only nipple he would take was the rubber bottle nipples that come with the pre-made bottles of formula. Even then he would vomit up to 10x a day and take over an hour to take a bottle. Not just spit up, but exorcist style projectile vomiting.  This lasted up until he was a year old. He would do the same thing once he started food. He had extreme texture issues.  He started feeding therapy at 4 months old but he still has a ton of issues eating.  He got diagnosed with EOE a few months after his second birthday. We still aren't sure what is causing his flare ups, he has an allergist appointment next month.\n\nI had a feeling he was autistic by the time he was 3 months old. Between the eating problems and some delays he was having something just felt off... He got diagnosed back in January.  \n\nHis behavior is just... to much.... he is always out of control. Child proofing doesn't work because he can't get past any childproofing method basically.  He is extremely strong for his age and very intelligent.  He lifted an almost 50 pound TV off its mount and ripped the metal baseboard cover off the wall. He will also push furniture across the room to get what he wants and either climb or pull down any child gate. For a long time he was obsessed with electrical sockets and he would rip the socket covers that screwed into the wall off the wall. I tried like 5 different socket covers and he got passed all of them. \n\nHis current fixation is water. I can't keep any sort of drink in the same room as him or he will pour it out. He will spend hours dumping liquid from one container to another or hours washing his hands. If I ever disrupt him he will get violent. Oh and the agression.... I am covered in bruises. He bites so hard that it breaks skin. He pinches and scratches hard. \n\nHe rarely sleeps or eats. He wakes up several times a night some nights and fights sleep every night. He will not nap. He takes 3 pediasures a day. Between EoE and texture problems eating is an extremely hard task for him. We try so hard but he just won't eat. He's at the 4th percentile and if things get worse he will need a feeding tube. Watching my baby starve himself is one of the worst things in the world. I'm doing all I can for him but it's still not enough. \n\nHe's thankfully verbal. He has very good speech for his age. He is a smart kid. He knows the full alphabet, all his colors and shapes, he loves to sing, he's great at puzzles and has fantastic fine motor skills.  He's advanced in many things, but his behavior is just so out of control all the time. He was originally diagnosed with ODD before autism. \n\nMy husband and I are constantly burnt out and exhausted.  Our daughter is attention starved because our son is a two man job. Neither my husband or I can work full time. We are barely able to keep up with part time. We have zero outside help. My parents were  \"helping\" but it turned out my mom was abusing the kids so I'm NC now. My husband doesn't have family. There is a very long waitlist for respite care in our area and moving is not a viable option right now for us. \n\nI'm sorry for the long rant. I'm at the end of my rope. Does it get any easier? I will take any advice. I want to do a better job for both kids right now, I just feel so defeated right now.\n\nEdited- grammar",

She has struggled for a while to get pregnant and it finally happened for her In  December. I never thought I'd want another baby n I did openly Express that. but I can't lie my best friend had a baby and I GOT MAJOR BABY FEVER. My husband always wanted another baby and our son will already be 5 in December.  I kinda figured now or never. So I stopped taking birth control and literally got pregnant a week later. I honestly thought it would have atleast taken a month or 2 , definitely didnt expect It to happen so quick . I literally asked my husband if we could just say it was an accident or something because I was so scared about telling her.  He said no and he didn't care. \n\nI didnt even go to the doctor yet but I was so excited I told everyone (my family). I saved my SIL for last because I knew she was going to feel indifferent about it. I waited until her , her husband and my other SIL were together and broke the news. Her husband and sister literally leaped out of their seats in excitement for me. But not her, she just kind of sat there and I felt the HEAVY tension. Afterwards everyone was talking about it and excited and all I wanted to do was crawl into a hole and die. I felt her anger from across the room. \n\nThe next day I cried and cried bc I felt so guilty and rude. How dare I get pregnant the same time as her? My husband said I'm overreacting and everything is fine but I dont like hostility or confrontation. \n\nToday now all I feel is anger. I really feel disrespected.  I could write 15 more paragraphs about what I have done for her, from free rides , letting them live with us for free to helping pay for her wedding , spending + 200$  on gifts for her baby.  Anyone would think I'm nuts for doing the amount of stuff I have done for her.  But that's beside the point. I love helping people and I did everything from the kindness of my heart and I dont even expect the same from her or anyone . I'm sad bc I really thought she was my friend.

        "content": "I don\u2019t know how to handle my 14F recently and I need some advice. \n\nI had been her primary parent until she turned 11 when I married my husband. Up until that point she had a complicated a short relationship with her father. Her are the main points because I could write a whole book on that point in our lives but: \n\n- her father and I separated when she was 2 and coparented as regularly as possible until she was 4. He was in the military and by the time she turned 4 she had only seen him 18 months out of her life. \n- at 4 he acted out violently towards her, hitting her with a bottle across the forehead and all visitation was stopped pending an investigation. After the investigation was completed we moved out of state and he stopped communicating with me. \n- at 8 he asked for visitation and after a 12 month transition period they started regular visitations EOW until she was 11\n- during these visits he would drive her to his parents house where she would spend the weekend and verbally abuse her during the car ride. She developed stress related constipation due to this but asked to not stop the visits as she had high hopes that he would eventually love her with time  \n- at 11 we moved out of state and he voluntarily gave up all visitation rights and asked for my husband to start the step parent adoption process and stopped all contact with her \n- after leaving the military he stayed unemployed in order he avoid paying child support and the adoption was his way of getting the fees removed from his record. He never paid child support or bought her anything other than one birthday gift, a blue Xbox controller, before we moved away. \n\nSince the adoption process started I noticed her behavior changing. I just chalked it up to puberty changes as it was never anything too out of control (she rolls her eyes, makes rude and disgusted faces if I put on makeup or do my hair, argues about small things like not being allowed to lay in bed until bedtime) but again nothing major. She doesn\u2019t slam doors, doesn\u2019t yell \u201cI hate it here\u201d and has never once had the dreaded \u201cyou aren\u2019t my dad\u201d argument with my husband. But my husband is a pretty good judge of character and has been saying for sometime that he feels like she is only here out of convenience and if she had her way she would rather be anywhere else but here. I didn\u2019t believe him until today but now I think that he might be right and I might just be the placeholder parent and it\u2019s killing me! \n\nThere are 2 other kids in the house, 10M and 5F with another on the way. We have primary custody of 5F and 10M is with us M-Th each week. 5F\u2019s birthday is coming up and my husband had a discussion about our views on sharing which 14F overheard. The girls never have a problem sharing and we have only ever had issues with 10M (who has ADD and Asperger). At some point Xbox controllers were brought up and today while at the store my daughter said \u201coh and just so you know - no one is allowed to touch my blue controller. You didn\u2019t buy it for me, in fact no one in this house bought it for me, birth father bought me that controller so you aren\u2019t allowed to dictate who can and can\u2019t use it\u201d and I was floored.  \n\nAfter everything and all of this time, a controller means so much to her? I feel like a second class citizen in her eyes. I\u2019m honestly sitting here wondering if I should even be a mother if the one person I\u2019ve devoted my entire existence to values a $30 controller over anything I\u2019ve given her. My husband is telling me to not take it personally but I can\u2019t help it! She been in therapy for years because of him! She had to wear diapers until she was 10 because she couldn\u2019t control her bowels because of him, she had an eating disorder because of him and yet he\u2019s still the one she would rather have. I\u2019m feeling pretty low.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "It's hard not to love an absent parent at that age. It must have killed my mom how much I looked up to my dad with everything that had happened. I'm going out on a limb and making assumptions, some of which comes from my own experience. \n\nThat controller is probably the one anchor that she has of her biological father. No matter how much he has hurt her, she might still have hope he is a good person. At such a young age we view our parents as fixers, nothing can't be done. Yeah, at 14 they think you don't know anything but if something goes wrong you can still fix it.\n\nWhile my dad wasn't in the military when I was born, his dog tags were my keepsake while he was in and out of my life. Those little plates of metal were one of the most important things to me. It was a driver of hope that one day my dad would be in my life like all of the dads in the movies. If I think back and compare it to what you're saying, that blue controller is a link to a hope and fantasy of better days. It's a hope that she wasn't abandoned and unloved by another person. \n\nI wish I could put you in my head around that time, or give you a better description, but yes, that $30 controller is most likely very important to your daughter and I honestly wouldn't screw with it. \n\nShe lives with you, doesn't get to fantasize about that.

        "content": "I\u2019m kind of freaking out internally, so if some of my sentences are sloppy, it\u2019s the adrenaline lol. \n\n\nBackstory: Wife (30F) and I (29M) have taken in her cousin that just recently turned 16 and we\u2019ll call her Kelly. She has spent her whole life sheltered with her mom  (partners aunt. We\u2019ll call her Dana) being her only friend because she\u2019s been part of an online alternative school program for many years. Kelly has lived through a lot and has essentially been homeless with her mom for the past 9 years or so. Dana would move them in with a family member, overstay their welcome, get kicked out, then find the next home. Everyone was always quick to show grace because of Kelly, but Dana would be the one to ruin every arrangement due to her bad hygiene and parasitic bum personality. That leads to my family because we were the last bridge that Dana hadn\u2019t burned. \n\n\nDana was kicked out of her previous arrangement because of a domestic altercation and moved in with us, which is about two hours away. My wife and I do well in our careers so we had the ability to host them for a little while. Since moving in, we were able to get Kelly some medical help that she\u2019s needed by twisting Dana\u2019s arm enough. Kelly has started seeing a therapist, has been on medication that\u2019s totally transformed her personality into a bright and funny girl, and she\u2019s much more interested in being social. Kelly found a part time job as a hostess and Dana got a job in retail. We\u2019ve been working with Kelly to learn how to use money, social skills, manners, and other hurdles her mom failed to teach her and it\u2019s been going great.\n\n\nLittle did we know Dana didn\u2019t really have intentions on leaving, so we gave her a 60 day notice and then the boot after 4 months because we\u2019re foster parents and Dana obviously won\u2019t be approved to stay with her charges. We convinced Dana to let Kelly stay with us since she\u2019s now hopping from hotel to hotel after refusing our help to find emergency housing.\n\n\nRecently, Kelly decided to try and find a second job so she can work more hours and THATS where we are tonight. Kelly got this job at a local BBQ restaurant and this was her first night working. During the shift, my wife texted Kelly to ask how it was going and she talked about a good looking boy she was working with. This isn\u2019t super as normal because Kelly has been a little boy crazy but there wasn\u2019t much to come of it since she\u2019s homeschooled. When Dana dropped Kelly off, my wife was asking about how the night went and discovered that this boy asked Kelly for her number and they ended up kissing\u2026and this is where I start getting heart palpitations haha. My wife listened and told Kelly she needed to slow it waaaay down and it she seemed to agree. My wife gave her a quick talk about being careful but didn\u2019t really know what else to say because she was in a state of shock. \n\n\nKelly is a very pretty girl. She\u2019s a little immature and naive for 16, but she\u2019s also pretty funny. It probably won\u2019t be hard for Kelly to find boys interested in her by any means. With her coming out of being sheltered while also being boy crazy, her hormones are on FIRE right. What are some healthy ways to navigate this? We\u2019ve become really close and we have practically taken the role of aunt and uncle, so she\u2019s still listening to what we say and doesn\u2019t hate us. All I have is what I would have wanted from my parents at her age. It hasn\u2019t been that long since I was a teenager, but I\u2019m not about to pretend that I\u2019m relevant haha. \n\n\nI\u2019ve suggested to my wife that she has the sex talk with her since Dana probably didn\u2019t and that we should approach this topic openly and honestly. We\u2019re not ultra conservative and with us being a blended family, this topic is the last thing I want to brush off. I\u2019ll add that Kelly has had struggles with her mental health in the past, so I\u2019m mostly scared that this is going to turn down a road that is going to put her back in that spot. \n\n\nOne hurdle we might run into is that we don\u2019t have any guardianship over Kelly and it\u2019s like pulling teeth for Dana to do anything, so any suggestion to get Kelly on birth control is not very practical. We didn\u2019t expect to run into this situation for another 10 years at least, so we\u2019re very unprepared. Any wisdom will be very appreciated",

We both work from home so it\u2019s not like she is just more used to me, but she definitely prefers me when it comes to her care. Her dad is definitely the roughhouser and teaser and she loves playing with him but sometimes he takes the tickling and playing too far. At least that\u2019s my theory as to why she can be so angry at him sometimes.  \n\nThis morning, her father and I walked into her room to wake her up for the day. Seconds after she gained consciousness, she immediately starts screaming NO at her dad. I always try to explain that speaking to people like that hurts their feelings but naturally for a toddler, she doesn\u2019t seem to care. We have been trying to ignore this behavior but now she has been yelling no louder and louder and more emotional. But it always feels defeating to constantly escalate the situation to address her behavior or send her to time out when she deliberately yells at her dad. Is this normal behavior and should we just ignore it until she grows out of this phase or adopt more firm and consistent consequences?",

I am absolutely terrified to become a mother. yesterday was the first time I felt LO move, he was basically stomping all on my cervix which was by far the most insane sensation I have ever experienced in life. up until now I guess the pregnancy did not seem real. growing this little human did not seem real. and now it's starting to hit me that in just a little over four months I will have a baby that is going to depend on me for the rest of his life. \n\nI'll also say that I do struggle with anxiety and depression. luckily the medicine I take is safe during pregnancy and i have been able to continue taking it. I also have struggled with addiction in the past, and I think part of me feels guilty and that I am not worthy of being a parent to this little guy? especially because he may be born with neonatal withdrawal symptoms from my medication (subxone). I was already cutting down my dose prior to pregnancy but was advised that it was dangerous to continue and to just keep at my regular dosage. so far all NIPT testing came back negative and baby is measuring along just fine. that is a relief. but I still have this crippling fear that he will hate me when he finds out that I have no idea what I'm doing. \n\nI had amazing parents growing up. they still are such role models to me and I'm really lucky that I grew up in such a nurturing environment and one that encouraged me to be my own person. I hope that I'll be able to do the same for my son. but I'm terrified that I'm not ready for this. it's been affecting my sleep and definitely intruding thoughts during the day. my body no longer feels like my own or that it belongs to me, and I have no idea how to reassure myself that I will be a good mom and just do the best I can. I know that's all I can do, but for some reason that does not feel like enough. \n\ndoes anyone have advice on how to help prepare for your first child without continuing to freak out? did you ever feel ready? am I going crazy or is this normal?",

Now, she is a 5'3, fully developed young lady, even though she's not even a teen yet. \n\nThis has definitely been an adjustment for me and my spouse (49m). Because she looks much older, I've had to have conversations with her about sex, pedophiles, internet safety, etc. that may not be totally age appropriate. She knows that any adult that asks you to keep secrets from parents or authorities is not a safe adult. Luckily, she's an only child so she's emotionally and intellectually mature, too. \n\nWe are a very close knit, touchy-feely family.  My daughter still enjoys cuddling with us. She'll curl up with me in bed to watch movies or snuggle in her Dad's recliner to watch videos together. She still asks us to tickle her back or play with her hair. She also tends to walk around the house in a tshirt and no pants, despite both of us getting onto her for it. \n\nLast weekend, we were waiting outside at a restaurant and she was sitting on her Dad's lap. My mom leaned over to me and said they need to stop doing stuff like that in public. At first I brushed it off, but the more I think about it, the more I started to worry. \n\nI don't want to stop being affectionate with my kid, since she'll soon be old enough that she won't want to snuggle. But I also don't want to give people the wrong idea, especially since she looks so much older. \n\nWhat sort of behaviors would be considered inappropriate, both in public and at the house? \n\nNote 1: I expect there will be many different opinions about this. We are pretty easy going people, but I'm interested in ALL opinions. Please be respectful to each other and respect people's boundaries, even if they are more or less strict than your own. \n\nNote 2: I believe that anyone can be a pedophile or assault a child. I've seen it happen too much within families and I don't trust even those closest to us. With that knowledge, I am as confident as I can be that my husband would never do anything intentionally inappropriate or sexual with our daughter.

I\u2019ve often struggled to explain how I know that my dad wasn\u2019t looking at me like that, but he knew other men were and so instead of protecting me and showing me how to be loved he backed off and in turn left me with \u2728daddy problems\u2728.

        "most_upvoted_comment": "I was your son growing up. In my experience, my disconnect with the world happened because I was so much more mature than my peers. Around 7th grade or so I realized I just wasn\u2019t into the things my friends were or the way they acted. My neighbor had an older brother and every time I was at his house I found myself gravitating towards him and his group of friends. I was able to make jokes they understood, we would do things that I actually found fun and exciting, I had never felt more like myself than I did with them. \n\n\nI eventually abandoned my school friends almost entirely. I had maybe 1 or 2 friends that I could bear to get through school, but all day I desperately wanted to go hang out with my older friends. \n\n\nI lost my virginity at 12 or 13, All the girlfriends I had were always older than me, and when I met my fianc\u00e9e I may have fibbed about my age and ended up with someone 7 years older than me. No im not proud of it, but those were the lengths I was willing to go to to be with somebody that I related to and felt like I could be myself with. \n\n\nAll this to say, my mom had no clue what to do either. We tried therapy, we tried in patient programs, we tried mentorship programs, but at the end of the day, all I craved was to be around people that I could feel like myself around. Unfortunately, these days with older teens that\u2019s basically guaranteed to come with vaping, sex, and weed. \n\n\nHere\u2019s my advice: \nTry to inhibit that feeling of maturity through other avenues. If he\u2019s good enough at a sport to play up with older kids, try that. If there are groups of older teens in your area see if he can get involved with that. Even though he\u2019s 13 there may be a local farm or small business that would be willing to pay him cash under the table. \n\nI know it sounds weird, but I really suggest you just treat him like he\u2019s 16/17 even though he\u2019s not. Out of all the kids in the world, is it really that unreasonable that some genuinely may be 3-5 years more mature than their peers? Unlikely? Maybe, but outliers definitely exist. And if there\u2019s just an inkling of a possibility that being treated with the same maturity that he feels he has could help solve the problem, why not try it?",

        "content": "Update: thanks for all the awesome feedback I really appreciate it \ud83e\udd70 I\u2019ve had a talk with my son and it actually went pretty well.\n\nNot exactly verbatim but in a nutshell I told him that I love our relationship and that he feels comfortable telling me when he is dating someone and that I love the honesty from him and I am always a safe space for him to tell me how he feels/who he is dating, and based on that then I would be honest with him.\n\nAt this stage the answer to sleep overs with someone he is dating is off the table for now given his age, emotional maturity/readiness, and that as his parent my job is to protect him and make sure he has safe/age appropriate boundaries in place.  \n\nWhile I get he\u2019s at the age of being curious/possibly wanting to explore things with people he needs to be ready, and right now I don\u2019t believe he is.  It isn\u2019t a matter of trust, it\u2019s again about age appropriate boundaries.  \n\nI\u2019ve also said his boyfriend is welcome to hang out here anytime and spend as much time together as they like.  Just in the appropriate setting.\n\nI also spoke  to him that while conversations around consent (they have a pretty extensive sex ed program at school and we are a very open book family when it comes to those conversations) and those things make sense in theory, in practice they can be very different.  \n\nI ended by saying I know it sucks but my job is to keep him safe and make age appropriate choices, and I get that wanting to explore \u201cstuff\u201d is absolutely natural and that curiosity is part of growing up and at some point that will all happen, it\u2019s just not a \u201cright now\u201d kinda thing. \n\n\ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffb\n\nNeed advice please\u2026 a little background first - navigating the teen years is a minefield for me, I grew up in an incredibly toxic/violent house and stability wasn\u2019t a thing I ever experienced.  My teen years were awful and spent partially homeless.  I have a narcissistic mother and absent father.  I also experienced all kinds of a abuse from various adults in my teen life.  So I really have no idea what I\u2019m doing.\n\n\n\nMy 13.5 year old son is \u201cdating\u201d ( I use quotes because to him it\u2019s just a really close friendship, but he wants to explore more and so does the other boy) a boy who he goes to school with.\n\nSide note: boy/girl I don\u2019t have any issues who my kids date, it\u2019s not even a thing - my only rule is \u201cdon\u2019t date dickheads\u201d.\n\nThey\u2019ve asked for a sleepover next weekend and I\u2019m 98% sure I\u2019m gonna say no, I\u2019m apprehensive about the \u201cno\u201d and it\u2019s because I\u2019m not comfortable leaving two kids who want to explore their relationship overnight.  I have no hesitation about them hanging out\u2026 just overnight feels a bit different.\n\nIn my mind dating someone (boy or girl) sleepovers are off the table at 13.

There are a million damn warnings when it comes to raising your teen, but you want to know what no one warns you about?\n\nNo one warns you that you'll have to take apart the p-trap on the kitchen sink at eleven pm on a Thursday night because your middle schooler put beef fat grease down the drain. Apparently the warm fat that was left in the cast iron after he made some rather questionable seasoned tacos last night did not LOOK like grease. It seems we have only seen it cold (when told to go dump it/scrape it out somewhere) and we never bothered to wonder where it came from or what it might look like fresh. \n\nAccording to the kid, he thought it was water. He thought, since the meat had been in the freezer and was frozen before he thawed it, it must have stored water in it and that was what was left in the pan. Nevermind the dozens of times said child has been asked to clean cooled grease out of that same exact pan. He did not put two and two together. \n\nSo, tonight, at 11 pm, my tween son learned about p-traps. Primarily, how to disassemble them and remove that grease clog. He gagged multiple times. We both did. Clearly a quality bonding experience. \n\nAt any rate, here is a warning to all you teen parents out there, teach them not to pour grease down the sink - even if you think they already know that.

She's a pretty independent kid, so when she mentioned that she was with some new friends in one of the girls csbin, I didn't think much of it.  Well we got back from the show and my daughter was passed out in our room, drunk and/or high. I didn't say anything at the time and just let her sleep it off, not wanting my wife to overreact and run I the vacation for her (my wife is pretty nieve to this stuff, growing up in a different culture, so she had no clue).\n\nAfter a little time to process after we got home, I confronted my daughter with this, and she admitted it.  It turns out her, another girl, and a boy got some THC vapes (carts, I guess?) and alcohol. They then went back to the girl's room where at least the other two had sex.  I don't know if my daughter was involved in the sex.  It seems weird that she would just sit there and watch, but I don't know. She does kind of have a boyfriend, so..?  She got her period right after and we had the discussion about looking for STDs, so no immediate worry at least.\n\nNow, I decided not to punish her.  I remember being a teenager and know that me telling her not to do it won't change a damn thing.  We had a long uncomfortable conversation about the risk of SA and the potential harm of THC and alcohol on a growing body and brain.  This part I'm fine with, as I know it would likely come eventually and was prepared.  Basically, I'm ok with her experimenting (though I wish she would have waited another year or two) but if it becomes a regular thing then punishments will start.\n\nWhat I wasn't ready for was the sex.  Up until very recently, my daughter identified as gay, so the tween sex talk didn't involve the penis at all.  It's obviously too late for a lot of that, so instead we had the abbreviated pregnancy and STD risk discussion. We also discussed consent and not being ashamed of what you want.  Finally, I decided to buy a box of condoms and keep them in her bathroom vanity. I told her I don't WANT her having sex at this age, but I do want her to be safe if she does.  There's a serious boyfriend starting up, and I'm not ready for grandkids for 10 years yet \n\nNow, my question (finally) is whether there's anything else I should discuss with her.  In many ways I'm glad this happened on a cruise with kids she isn't likely to ever see again.  I'm worried that she'll take the lack of punishment as an \"ok\" to do this more, but I know my parents punished me and I got high and drunk every weekend at that age, so clearly that didn't work.  \n\nThe sex is the thing that scares me the most, but I'm sure a large part of that is just that no father can comfortably think of his daughter having sex.  Objectively I know it's healthy for her to start exploring at this age, but emotionally I want her to be my little princess forever.",

Backstory: They have been dating nearly a year, and have maintained a sweet, innocent, pure relationship thus far. They have kissed, but nothing more and they have vowed openly to us and to his family that they intend to wait until marriage before being sexually active. As much as I want to believe this, neither of her older brothers took that route and I know how temptation leads teens (and adults) to do things they otherwise don\u2019t \u201cplan\u201d to do. He is quite the gentleman, and we do like him. He speaks often of his intention to one day marry our daughter.

I hated my mother for not letting me go with my boyfriend any time I wanted,  but when the relationship ended,  I was thankful to still have my friends,  my own life,  and my home which was a safe space for me.

        "content": "First of all, I'm the caregiver of a teenager (15f). Shes not my bio kid but I am her primary caregiver and at this time only mother figure.\nI'm a younger woman (27f) so most of my peers are just now having babies or have had them in the past 3 years. Watching them raise their children has been wonderful. They don't realize the absolute privilege it is to raise a child entirely in your own sense, without regard to the possible desires of an out of sight bio parent or the state's heavy hand over how you navigate parenthood. They each get to explore themselves as well as the whole and unique personality of this new human without much interference. They all get to pursue their own parenting styles and set up for the long journey of parenthood in their own unique way, with no worry of their parenting styles being contradicted much by outside forces. There are parents who admit when their child is a teen they will allow that child to smoke or drink in their own home just to ensure their safety. There are parents who completely abstain from drug and alcohol culture and do everything possible to shield their children from it. It's fascinating that there are so many socially accepted ways to parent. And then there's me.\n\nNot just me. My stepsister, same age as me, fosters teenagers so she deals with a lot of this too. I imagine there are a lot of people like her and I that I will never get to hear from as they are drowned out by the howls of \"have you tried this?\" from tons of parents who have yet to experience even their child's first romp into adolescence, let alone taking on the care of a child who has been there for a minute and already paved their own way in life for dealing with everything puberty comes with. I find myself in a bizarre position, where I love being a mother, however, being wedged between the states unblinking eye and the long lasting psychological effects of an absent bio mom is...difficult. There's no room for, \"oh, if I catch my child smoking weed, then I'll do this and this and this.\" No, with the state watching, you remove any drugs from your child's possession immediately and talk to them about why they can't do that. Same with alcohol. Same with sex. Same with bad grades. Same with everything the state is concerned with. My parenting style is one I like to think is gentle enough with the exception of the expectations of our legal system. There are things that are just a blatant hard no, no further discussion beyond \"it's just illegal.\" No moral grey area. No actual open conversation. This isn't how I saw myself parenting when I was younger and envisioned motherhood. I know it's not the most effective parenting. I know this child will probably go buck wild as soon as she's 18, and that's going to be hard to watch as someone who loves her.\n\nAll this to say, most days I'm stressed over this. She, as a teenager with a troubled past and history with drug abuse does, sneaks things in. She tries to sneak away to do things she knows she shouldn't. She lies about grades, even though I check them everyday. I'm put in the position of making sure she doesn't do these things. I'm the helicopter parent I never wanted to be. I am stressed. This position has been rewarding (I get to watch her become a young adult despite her troubled past. I get to experience motherhood) but also draining (I have to watch her like a hawk. I deal with the rejection of her disdain Everytime I take something she was previously allowed to have under her bio moms roof.) None of my peers, besides my sister, understand. I made a post on Facebook explaining my troubles and seeking friends with teenagers to relate to. Before I knew it, the comment section was full of my current friends, with their sweet innocent bio toddlers faces set as their profile picture, giving me parenting advice. I could had thrown my phone. I didn't ask for advice. I asked for relatable friends.",

Now as a teenage male being invited to a older woman\u2019s house with the promise of drugs, alcohol, and sex it wasn\u2019t too hard to say yes to. It wouldn\u2019t be too consistent but it\u2019d be periodic over the course of a year and finally when I was 17 an accident happened and I let her know right then and there I was gonna get a plan b because I had no intentions of being a father right out of high school. She took it but it didn\u2019t work (or she didn\u2019t actually take it idk) point is she\u2019s like 7 months now and idk wtf to do. Its like there\u2019s no winning here and I just can\u2019t fathom why she would decide to keep it. I have nothing, I\u2019m just starting to learn how to establish myself and really be on my own. I hate her I know I shouldn\u2019t because I knew what I was doing but I wish I never met her. I hate that she\u2019s gonna be the mother of my child because no person that\u2019s that grown and looks at a teen that way is normal. She wants me to be present but I still want to live my life, I still want to pursue my career, and go to college and just see shit I\u2019m not fucking ready. If I was with my gf yk someone I actually love and care for and she jus got pregnant, sure ok it happens we\u2019d just be a young couple figuring shit out but this is so fucked up. I don\u2019t like her as a person I wish I had sense back then like I do now. On one hand I could co parent but I don\u2019t trust myself enough I already have enough shit wrong with me how can I be a good father? And I could just be a bank account but that doesn\u2019t feel right either like I have no qualms paying my dues and anything extra but the thought of knowing my kid is out there and I don\u2019t know if their ok or miserable because of a lack of a dad or being abused or fucking anything those thoughts would eat me alive like they are right now. I have so many things I want to do and succeed in but I barely sleep cuz of this. I thought about just taking myself out but I don\u2019t want to be a coward and I don\u2019t want to leave my kid with a groomer. I can\u2019t even die in peace, that\u2019s the problem I guess.

I'm a firm believer on sex education and the principle of slowly releasing control while building your preteens & teens into well rounded adults.\n\nI want a discussion- not hostility toward others views.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "I'm German and I obviously can't speak for 83 million people, but in general I would say this is really a non-issue here. I can't remember ever having any questions about sex or sexuality, because every question was always answered instantly and comprehensively, and most of them at an age before my memory sets in. My son is 6 now and I don't think anyone in his friend group would not know about sperm and egg cells and all of that, but also why a boy's penis sometimes gets hard, for instance, or what sex is and that it can be a pleasurable experience.\n\nThere is sex education in school as well, about once a year, usually as part of biology classes. It starts from how different animals multiply, covers human reproduction, and then for teenagers STDs and protection, but also related aspects like e.g. porn. However, the quality, focus, and level of detail of course depends on the teacher.\n\nIf you combine that with the fact that sex doesn't have these strong moral connotations that it has in some more conservative or religious cultures and that teenagers usually become sexually active at an age where we parents are moving more and more into an advisory role anyway, I think the idea of controlling your child's sexuality would be rather foreign to people here.\n\nIn practice there is also two other aspects. Whereas in some parts of the US it seems that safety is seen as something coming directly from the parents with the child in more of a passive role, German parents, I would say, see safety more as coming from a child's ability to make sensible and safe decisions, and so raising children with increasing spaces where they can and have to act indipendently and unsupervised from a young age has a far stronger emphasis\\*. One consequence of this is that by the time children are teenagers it's common for them to be unsupervised for at least a couple of hours after school every day and all day during school holidays. It's also not uncommon for a 14 year old to occasionally stay home alone while the parents go on a weekend trip somewhere boring.\n\nSecondly, German culture emphasises every person's right and need for their own private space. So children usually have their own room that they also don't have to share with their siblings and they are allowed to close the door as soon as they can be trusted in there without supervision, so somewhere between the third and fifth birthday. This is of course also true if they have friends over. So, for us, it would be very strange to go to our teenagers after more than a decade and treat them like a toddler again with the door open. So teenagers have ample opportunity to become sexually active if they choose to.\n\nSo if you combine all of these factors, I would say parents try to lay the foundation for their children to use their own judgment when it comes to sex and sexuality, and are therfore not that actively involved into the concrete decisions, which makes the entire thing rather relaxed.\n\n\\* This is also recognized in German law. There is a decision by the highest German court that it is okay for a normal 7 year old to stay unsupervised on a public playground for up to two hours, while parents of a normal 5 year old would have to check on him in intervals of about 15 to 30 minutes.",

        "content": "I'm gonna give background first, you can skip to the lower section if you don't want to read the whole thing.\n\n**Background**\n\nSince I had my kids I knew I would need to homeschool them.  So much drama in the world.  I toured schools of course, but as a SAH mom I had the time and willpower to homeschool.  So when my oldest daughter turned 5 I sought out and found a homeschool curriculum and homeschool collective.  \n\nMy daughters have been happy in the collective.  Small.  Innocent.  Childlike wonder without corrupting influences.  It's been great.  They get dirt under their finger nails, laugh until they're breathless, have a small group of trusted boys and girls (9 total including them) of different ages in the collective to play with and have as learning partner.  \n\nMy oldest is 11 now (youngest 9) and it is time for 6th grade for her.  The plan was always to teach my daughters through elementary years and then, having given them a wonderful, safe, and innocent childhood send them off into the big world of middle school equipped with all the intellectual tools to succeed in life; having given them an uncorrupted and loving childhood.  \n\nI sought out advice from other happy homeschool moms who had seen their kids off  to middle school on how to ease their transition into the chaos of the mainstream social society.  I got back a few things.  Make sure they've up on whatever the most recent kids movies so they have things to talk about and understand the other kids' references and whatnot.  That sort of thing.\n\nOne of the most common ones I got, especially for girls specifically, was to make sure they have clothes that are stylish for middle school so the other girls don't bully them.  On the surface I'm okay with that.  I've always made some of my own kids' clothes, since its one of my skills and kind of a hobby.  My mother taught me growing up and both my daughters know how to sew too.  Not all of their clothes are Made by Mom, obviously, so they've always had some store bought clothing.  Especially for school activities (and I lack the skill to make shortalls, overalls, intricate dresses, and so on... I mostly have just made their shorts, pants, shirts, and simple day dresses).  \n\nI asked my daughter about this and she was really excited at the prospect of going shopping and picking out school clothes.  So we made plans, my husband took my youngest daughter so we could spend the weekend picking out outfits (I also planned to use it as a math lesson on budgeting).  \n\n# SKIP TO HERE IF SKIPPING BACKGROUND\n\nRant: \n\nI'm pretty aghast at what is considered \"tween\" \"middle school\" \"juniors\" clothing. Once you move out of the kids section (and honestly some of that is too risque) it gets highly inappropriate immediately.  Every, EVERY pair of shorts and almost every pair of pants cups the cheeks and is way too tight and showey.  Leggings, jeggings, jeans, shorts, it doesn't matter.  Everything is designed to make the booty stand out.  Then there's the tops.  The tank tops show most of her chest, or if they don't they're just clingy to emphasize curves.  It's freaking absurd!  You shouldn't see the outlines of undies and bras on a child! What is mainstream society trying to do to our poor freaking kids here?!   Train them to be teens on display?  It's absurd!!!  It's outrageous!  Moving from kids clothes to \"tween\" clothes is going from innocent to inappropriate.  It's over the top.  The shorts AT MOST go 1/4 down the thigh most of them and half the shirts risk or do show the skin of her belly.  Who is that for?  What does it exist?!   I'm an adult woman and I wouldn't be caught dead in such clothes, even when I was college aged!\n\nRest of the story: \n\nSo my daughter and I spent what was supposed to be a joyous day of mother-daughter bonding over outfits in constant argument.  It didn't matter what store we were at, we would collect things she liked, head to the fitting room and it would be a constant stream of \"I like this mom\" to me looking at it and my eyes about falling out of my head and having to say no for her own good.  \n\nAfter what felt like 25 stores of the same pattern I switched to picking things out for her and having her try them on, which even though she ended up with the same things she probably would have anyway, she hated because it was mom's choice not her choice.  The whole day was a disaster.  \n\nI had to resort to picking out shorts made for boys because they're the only ones that actually go down most of her thigh and don't put her booty on display.  The boys shorts at Macy's actually fit her waist and go to her knee without being baggy or super tight.  So now she has both jean shorts and khaki in different colors.  I picked ones she looks good in but she hates them because I'm the one that picked them (if she'd had her choice you'd have thought she was wearing swimming board shorts to school!).  \n\nThankfully she mostly got tops she's happy with because there is enough variation in those that we found compromises that weren't clinging to her form like spandex but were still made for tween/junior girls.   She was pretty devastated to not get anything from pacsun at the mall, but literally all the tops either showed her chest or belly.  It's like a conspiracy to only sell 2/3 of a shirt!\n\nWe also got some dresses but that took some doing as a lot of the ones in stores have the same problem where the upper 1/3 of her torso is on display.  Like the tops we found compromises that weren't too showy and actually reached her knee.\n\nSo she came home with 10 outfits.  We got shorts that aren't booty shorts, shirts that aren't clingy but flowy, and dresses that aren't mini.  \n\nWhat was supposed to be a few hours of bonding and fun turned into an absolute slog of arguments and bitter feelings.  I know tween years come with attitude but it was really hard and frustrating beyond that attitude issue.  I had to threaten to buying fabric and doing some made-by-mom clothes for her to be willing to compromise at some point.    Instead of coming home happy and appreciative of all the new clothes, name brands and bought in stores she's resentful and sulking.  \n\nI'm appalled by what corporations list as for \"tweens\" \"middle school style\" and \"juniors\" in stores these days.  My daughter is 11, not 17.  Why are they trying so hard to train her to be comfortable being on display to the world?  Why are age-appropriate clothes so hard to find for their actual age?!  It's like companies think the moment a girl gets her monthly visitor they need to pronounce her a sex object and put her on the shelf for all the boys to see or something!\n\nSo that's it.  That's my venting.  I needed to rant and get it off my chest. \n\nBut what the heck?!  I know I'm more conservative (small c, I don't vote) than most, but how do other parents cope with just buying the crap the companies push out for young girls to wear?!  \n\nIf she wasn't so adamant about trying public school I'd honestly be considering putting her into online school to avoid this level of corrupting influence.    I honestly don't know how parents send their girls out into this crazy world.",

        "content": "I hope it is okay that I share this here for discussion because I\u2019m just so annoyed by this interaction and I have no one else to tell. \n\nI was talking with a good friend about holidays with children. We started talking about Halloween and she asked what my 2 year old would be dressed as. I said that her favorite movie is Disney\u2019s \u201cTurning Red\u201d so I was looking for a red panda costume.\n\nNow, first let me say that I understand that this movie was geared more towards pre-teen girls, so it has themes that resonate more with them. But I\u2019ve watched it (a thousand times by now!) and there is nothing I find inappropriate for younger children. They don\u2019t talk about sex or drugs or anything clearly objectionable. The mom just mentions pads once or twice and I see no issues with that. About 50% of the population of earth experiences a period at some point so I\u2019m totally fine with explaining that to my daughter. I don\u2019t insist others do but it\u2019s just a biological function. And are you telling me my daughter who never leaves my side will never ask why mommy has to put a sticky cloth in her pants once a month?? \n\nAnyway, as soon as I say the movie name, my friends face drops and she becomes very serious. She says \u201cyou know that movie is not okay, right? It\u2019s weird. Why would you let your daughter watch that?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t want to fight so I just said \u201coh I\u2019ve watched it and find it fun and and endearing. My little one also started taking calming breaths and self-regulating her own emotions while mad after seeing the main character do that so it\u2019s all good\u201d \n\nShe kept at it. She said it\u2019s \u201call about your period\u201d and \u201call about furries\u201d and \u201cpromotes disobeying your parents\u201d \n\nI finally get her to move on and she then says \u201cwell my girls watched Beauty and the Beast back to back.\u201d\n\nAre you kidding me? Aside from the \u201call about your period\u201d issue, Beauty and the Beast has all the same \u201cissues\u201d if not more so. \n\nYou\u2019re concerned about \u201cfurries\u201d because a girl is transformed into a panda but it\u2019s nbd that a dude was transformed into a beast and literally has romantic situations while in Beast form. \n\nYou\u2019re concerned Turning Red \u201cpromotes disobeying your parents\u201d but when Belle explicitly ignores her father\u2019s commands multiple times, that\u2019s totally fine. \n\nB&TB is about a girl that runs off and shacks up with a violent and toxic man in the hopes she can change him but Turning Red is awful because a little girl learns how to balance all parts of herself and reconcile her desire for independence with her love for her strict mother. \n\nI just think if you consider any kids movie, they all have some layer of adult themes. \n\nLion king - violence/death, a Macbeth reenactment, disobeying parents\nNemo - death of a parent, threat of violence (sharks), disobeying parents \nCinderella - seeking marriage, disobeying parents, step parent abuse \nSnow White - jealousy, poisoning, actual death of the main character, seeking marriage \nMoana - disobeying parents, violence\nSecret Life of pets - violence, romantic relationships, abandonment \nShrek - obvious\n\nThe list goes on but to some extent that\u2019s what makes these movies great. They\u2019re supposed to have layers. You\u2019re supposed to get different things out of watching them as you age. There is supposed to be a component that makes them watchable for parents. \n\nAnyone else ever told you were wrong for letting your child enjoy something?",

We aren\u2019t necessarily against them having sex because we know they\u2019re going to do what they\u2019re going to do. Our biggest concern is more about STD\u2019s and/or becoming teenage parents.\n\n I have two friends that had their first kid at 15 and although they wouldn\u2019t trade their kid for the world, they have stated how hard it is to be a parent at that age and that if they could do it all over and delay it by a few years they would, but still have their kid when they were more stable to, they would choose that option. That is why is especially would like I put from people who were teenage parents themselves. \n\nGive me your thoughts, please.",

While waiting in line, we were followed by a group of 4 young men, ~15ish in age.\n\nThese boys were rowdy physically in line, and bumped into me several times. I kept my own kids ahead of me, and I went with the flow. That wasn't the problem though-these boys had the foulest mouths ever. They first talked about how they hated white people. The boys were all Hispanic-ish looking..me and my youngest two are white. My bonus kid, who was not with us, is a POC. \n\nEvery other word from these boys was fuck, shit, bitch, faggot, gay, etc. Lots of gay bashing here. Then moved onto Porno type talk of eating girls out when their on their periods, anal sex+disgusting ideas,  etc. I mean, like seriously gross shit. While me and my younger kids are 2' away. \n\nFor the record, I couldn't care less about the fuck shit bitch talk, but I did have a problem with the racist and homophobic talk, as well as their little porno re-creation circle jerk. \n\nEventually, these boys decided it would be fun to spit on one another. I felt something wet hit my back, spun around, and in my meanest \"Mom\" voice, said, \"get the fuck away from me you little brats!\"\n\nThey did obey and backed off quite sheepishly.\n\nBut now I'm conflicted.

Or am I looking at this wrong?I know it may be strange but I\u2019ve had dads try to get my son to talk to their daughters in a romantic way so I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if this is what my friend was up to but maybe it\u2019s an affordability thing.My son 100% doesn\u2019t want any girlfriends or sex yet.

I had dropped our daughter off at her boyfriend house earlier in the day and she told me she was all set for a ride home. \n\nCome 9pm that night, I noticed she was still at her bfs house so I asked who was coming to get her and she said she was staying there. She just turned 15 though and has been dating this boy for under 6 months. I said I'm not okay with that and went to pick her up. My ex thinks is fine for her to stay there though, but also never thought to ask me about how I felt about it. \n\nWhen our son was 16, we allowed his gf to stay over our house under the condition she(or him) sleeps on the couch. At that time, they had been together for over a year. She was also friends with my daughters. I was against this, but allowed it but my wife was okay with it, plus they were still there at our house so they were mostly supervised. I think this was a mistake on my part, but too late to fix that now. \n\nSo, I tried to explain the differences between my daughters situation and my sons situation and that it isn't about she's a girl and he's a boy. I also explained to her that part of this is a failure in the part of us as parents and that I was upset these decisions are made without me. \n\nAnyway, when I dropped her off at home, I asked my son if it was common that their mother stayed at a friend's house and he said \"It's becoming more common lately\". They 15 and 18 now so it's not like they're babies but I'm still uncomfortable with it. They have an older brother(was my step kid) that is there but he's been locked up in mental hospitals for emotional issues, might be on the spectrum, and sometimes has his friends over. I'm a little  uncomfortable with random 20- something year olds hanging out with my mid-teen daughters too.\n\nCurious if I'm overreacting about this and if not, how I should approach it with my ex. We've only been split up a month now, so there's nothing official yet and it wasn't an angry or violent split up, although it was very much not wanted in my end. I'm staying about 15 minutes away from the house now at another place but I'm considering going back to the house on nights that she doesn't come home. The house is technically still half mine.\n\n\nedit - I appreciate the advice, but I want to reiterate that I'm not concerned with the fact that my daughter has sex, I've covered that issue with her already. This is more about the feeling that my ex is making important decisions without my input and also not being around when I think she needs to be.",

It was already late, 1030ish, and I really wasn't too thrilled to set everything up then.   I told myself that these are the things he'll remember me doing for him so I sucked it up and got it done.   \n\nWe were waiting for his friend to come over and I put on Superbad.  I know it's a rated R movie with some very colorful language and situations.   I didn't think we'd watch much of it as his friend would arrive shortly then they would watch what they wanted to.   It turned out that it was too late for his friend to come over after all. But that's when the magic happened.   \n\nDuring some of those scenes I was able to speak up and reinforce the importance of the topics in the moment.   There was the condom scene where I was able to stress the importance of what they were talking about.  Then there was a scene where one of the teens was about to have sex with a very intoxicated young woman and I was able to agree with the character and acknowledge the importance of both consent and underage drinking/ poor decision making.   \n\nAt first I was second guessing myself about putting this movie on for my son and I.  But after it was over I was very happy with opening the door of communication about sex and coming of age questions and topics.  This really worked for us as we were laughing through the entire movie while learning the importance of so many things.",

        "content": "So I am fairly confident I could have given a great CIS HET sex talk to my daughter if she was actually HET, but she is a Lesbian. What sorts of things should I include in that chat? Are there lesbian-specific advice/warnings I should be sharing...?",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Lesbian parent here! A lot of what you're talking about will be pretty similar to what you'd be having discussions about with a heterosexual teen: the importance of affirmative consent, a two-way discussion about what a healthy relationship looks like and the warning signs of a relationship that is turning controlling/abusive, how porn isn't a good representation of healthy sex, etc. As a lesbian, pregnancy won't necessarily be a concern, and so it's not uncommon for young queer women (and the people teaching them about sex!) to feel like safe sex precautions don't apply to them, when STIs are still a significant concern. Just like you talk about protection with straight kids, you'll need to talk with her about the STIs that can be transmitted between women and how to protect herself against them in a scenario where she doesn't know when the last time another person was tested (you can talk about choosing lower-risk activities and also using protection like dental dams, and how to make a dental dam out of saran wrap or cutting a condom in half).  You can be honest with her- some of this information is new to you, and you can frame it like you're figuring it out together rather than a situation where you're throwing knowledge at her if that makes sense. You should also talk to her about how it's really important that she get tested regularly once she's sexually active, (yes, queer girls/women should be getting tested too!) and you two can discuss how to ask a potential partner about when they've last been tested.\n\nDepending on how old your daughter is, a book might be amazing for her. If she's in high school, [Girl Sex 101](https://www.amazon.com/Girl-Sex-101-Allison-Moon-ebook/dp/B00TGP74U4) by Alison Moon is a fantastic resource that I would recommend probably for 9th grade and older. Straight girls can turn to their friends for advice and troubleshooting, but it's much harder as a queer girl to find frank, non-fetishizing information about what gay sex actually IS, and I'd so much rather my daughter have a book she can turn to rather than needing to google things. I love how it emphasizes respect for your partner, and is honest without reading like porn. There's a chapter on consent, a chapter on safe sex in queer relationships- all things I like to see. I'd describe it as sort of a more grown-up, gay version of *The Care and Keeping of You* hahaha.\n\nEDITED TO ADD: If she's younger than high school, a more general sex education resource might be a better fit. You can point her in the direction of [Scarleteen](https://www.scarleteen.com/), which is an awesome, science-based website where a sex educator answers young people's questions about healthy relationships, sexuality, STI avoidance, consent, how to know if you're ready for sex, etc. Their \"Sex Readiness Checklist\" is one of my favorite resources for the 8th grade-11th grade set- great list of statements for her to evaluate to know if she's ready, for example, \"I know that sex and love can co-exist, but also that they are not the same -- even if I love the person I am considering or having sex with. I do not seek to have sex to use it to manipulate, control or influence my partner or to try and \"earn\" or prove love.\" Seriously an amazing resource for kids of all genders and sexualities to have at their disposal. Check it out [here](https://www.scarleteen.com/article/relationships/ready_or_not_the_scarleteen_sex_readiness_checklist).\n\nAnother book recommendation- *S.E.X.: The All-You-Need-To-Know Sexuality Guide to Get You Through Your Teens and Twenties* is also an awesome, science-based resource that I think all high schoolers should read. It's written by the founder of Scarleteen (a sex educator) and it has information like risk evaluation (e.g. I want to hook up with this person, what are the least risky activities STI-wise that I can do?) and some information on queer sexuality as well. It's still important that she know about protection in the context of straight sex as well (just like straight kids should know about queer sex), just in case she decides at some point in the future that she might not be exclusively gay.\n\nIf your daughter is a teenager, you should also look for recommendations for queer-friendly gynecologists in your community and set up an appointment for her. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists actually recommends that girls have their first gyno appointment at some point between the ages of 13-15, before they're sexually active so that they can establish a relationship, ask any questions they might have about sex/sexuality/their bodies, etc. before it's actually needed. And that way she won't have to announce to you that she's sexually active and needs to start getting tested, because she already goes to the gynecologist regularly. They can also help with heavy or painful periods, show her how to do a breast self-exam, all of those important things. Just a good thing for every girl of any sexuality to get positive associations with a gynecologist early.\n\nWhen she goes off to college/moves out, make sure you send her with a pack of condoms and ideally a Plan B, even if she rolls her eyes and tells you you're being crazy because she's a lesbian. Again, trans lesbians exist, experimentation with your sexuality happens (as well as SA, unfortunately), and you never want her to be unprepared.",

Her grandmother, my mother, is certainly a bit holier than though meaning she fasts, doesn\u2019t drink doesn\u2019t believe in premarital sex etc, actively decries homosexuality (but doesn\u2019t trash anyone, just thinks it\u2019s wrong).\n\n I personally believe that Jesus is the who he purports to be but that\u2019s as far as I go. The God I know is light and acceptance (and ok if I\u2019m honest just a bit of brimstone which makes me uncomfortable). I believe that many people distort the Bible for no good, bad, and terrible reasons. I do not wish to be associated with the fire and brimstone crew condemning everyone they hate to hell. We all have our things and I\u2019m not fit to judge anybody. I have no problem with anyone, bring on the drag queens and the martinis! \n\nAt any rate, my daughter has started watching religious influencers and attending her  public school\u2019s bible study. I have taken the position that I will neither encourage nor bemoan how my daughter chooses to practice her religion, though I have told her that many people use the Bible for their own means and that the if you look hard enough it can be used to support anything. The example I gave her was mixed synthetic clothing which is prohibited by the Old Testament. Well, that shot down her teenage fashion.\n\nAnyway, some days ago, she\u2019s crying on the couch and is sad. She thinks I\u2019m going to hell because I don\u2019t read the Bible and aren\u2019t as devout as my mother. She thinks her friends who are gay are going to hell. And now I\u2019m like oh hell naw! How do I allow my daughter her right to choose her own religion without allowing her to become a judgy holier than thou weirdo?  I also don\u2019t want her to be in pain at the thought of me going to hell. (Note, I respect atheist and other religious or non religious views but I will ignore calls to suggest introducing her to santanism or other things as not made in good faith for my family) love and light to all.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "You're not generally going to convince somebody to not be religious (and will be met with a lot of resistance if you try) but there's a pretty wide diversity of religious views (including different flavors of christianity -- which sounds like what she's practicing) out there that she likely hasn't been exposed to. Do you have more welcoming churches or clergy/people in religious life nearby that she might visit or be open to talking to? Hearing from people who share her fundamental beliefs but see the role of faith in the world dramatically differently could do a lot to moderate her beliefs. \n\nIf all her influences are grandma and other teens (who tend to be strident in whatever beliefs they hold) she's likely to end up mimicking what they believe.",

        "content": "Hello,\n\nI am asking for some parental advice in regards to my 17 year old son.\n\nSo, previously he has gotten into some trouble with a certain group of friends, two friends in particular. He\u2019s been best friends with these two his entire life.\nThe trouble he has gotten into include lying, sneaking out, smoking weed and having sex with girls. You know\u2026the typical teenage stuff..I am NOT excusing this behavior, or brushing it off, I understand the severity of this, I\u2019m just saying, it hasn\u2019t been anything super extreme. \n\nThe two friends honestly are your stereotypical  douchy teen boy \u201cbros\u201d. \nAfter the last time my son got into trouble with them, my wife and I told him he\u2019s not allowed to talk to or hang out with them anymore. He\u2019s 17, when he\u2019s 18, if that\u2019s the people he wants to be associated with, that\u2019s not something we can stop him from doing.\n\nMy son is heartbroken. He misses his friends and just stays home every weekend and doesn\u2019t do anything. All of his friends are in the same circle and the friends in question are almost always around. \n\nMy son just got a car and a job. His grades have significantly improved and I gave him a few drug tests which he has passed.\nHe is always honest about where he is going and keeps us in the loop on what he\u2019s doing. \n\nHe swears he\u2019s changed and knows the risk of getting his car taken away if he gets into anymore trouble and is begging to hang out with his friends again.\n\nI feel for him. I want him to have a fun teenage life, but not be put into dangerous situations or be put in a position that\u2019s going to leave him tempted to make bad decisions. \n\nThe last time we gave him a second chance, he blew it immediately. This was only three months ago.\nNow he\u2019s asking for a third chance. \nHe said he would do weekly drug tests and let me go through his phone to make sure he\u2019s not getting into any trouble.\n\nAlso, we do have Life360 and can see where he is at all times. \n\nHalf of me thinks he\u2019s better off without these kids, but the other half wants to give him another chance. I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nI have a bad tendency of just giving my kids the benefit of the doubt because I feel bad.\nI do trust him, but there is still a part of me that is weary about him being with this group of friends again.\n\nDo I let him hang with his friend and be super cautious?\nOr do I let him resent me and my wife and just continue to keep him from being with friends and stay at home?",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "He can deal with being unhappy and missing his friends.\n\nCan he deal with legal troubles?

It\u2019s so expensive that we give it away because it is so hard to earn it back once that gift has been broken.\n\nThis is what we told our teen son. We did not give him the third chance to break our trust. He was required to earn it back, and that took a very long time by design. He needed to know just how expensive that free gift had been.\n\nHowever, he did learn. He\u2019s an adult now, and he has thanked us for our actions during that time.

We talk about sex, drugs, friendships, you name it, and I\u2019ve worked very hard to not shame her when we discuss these things, even if I don\u2019t agree with her opinion. She has older step siblings that are now all adults and have at one point in time been addicted to nicotine. Their mother smoked around them growing up and smokes with them now. My daughter doesn\u2019t see her dad extremely frequently, but knows that he vapes. \n\nTons of kids at her school vape, and she tells me about her friends vaping in the bathroom at school and getting in trouble for it. She insists that she\u2019s against it and thinks they\u2019re stupid for risking their health for a little watermelon-cotton-candy vapor, but I know peer pressure and wanting to fit in can turn a rational mind into thinking it\u2019s no big deal if so many people do it. \n\nShe asked me for $20 last week to pay back someone for several trips to a vending machine, insisting that it was over several weeks when I questions such a large amount for snacks. She hasn\u2019t given me any reason not to trust her, but I do remember when her older step siblings were teens and used the trick of asking for cash for something innocuous and then purchasing vapes at school from friends. \n\nMaintaining open communication with her is extremely important, and I don\u2019t want to do anything that jeopardizes that, but I\u2019m also stressed about her starting to head down the path of nic addiction and want to cut it off before it starts.

Over the holiday break the child came to my home to do a gift exchange with my child. I\u2019ve never met her mother but she\u2019s over once in a while, did trick or treat with us, etc. Well, while she was here she told my daughter she was grounded and couldn\u2019t stay long because she was accused of \u201cseducing\u201d one of her younger female siblings (ages 7 and 3). My child asked her if the accusations were true. She said she denied it to her mother but did engage in what sounded like potential sexual abuse with one of them.

She told him how it wasn\u2019t good for him. He claims he only smokes weed to relieve stress.\n\nWe spoke this morning and I expressed my concern over his \u201crisky\u201d behavior.

        "content": "I'm 43 and my wife is 44. We have two children, a fifteen-year-old boy and a twelve-year-old girl. We have been married for 18 years and we both have good careers that are not very demanding. By all accounts, we are a happy, stable, well-adjusted family. We are religious and attend church twice a week. We are not what you might think of as \u201ccrazy evangelicals\u201d but we believe in God and the Bible and we do our best to live our lives as such. We love to entertain at our home, and we have lots of friends and family that we are close to. We are a multicultural household in that my wife is originally from India and I am just your average white guy.\n\nOur son (let\u2019s call him Ben) started high school last year and at the same time finished puberty very quickly. To us it seemed like he changed overnight from a chubby, reliable, studious, responsible and respectful boy into a young man with an altogether different set of personality traits, many of which were new to us.\n\nThings changed for us in our family dynamic pretty quickly. Ben plays lacrosse for his high school and has gotten very entrenched with a new friend group. Many of these boys are nice and their parents are very nice as well. Lacrosse practice is five days a week, which leaves not much time for schoolwork, although he still tries very hard to maintain straight As. Lacrosse is great because Ben loves it and it gives him that physical outlet that all growing boys need. Ben is still doing very good in school, he is nice to his sister, and is involved in church in healthy ways.\n\nThe problem we are having with Ben is his attitude towards us and the use of his phone. If we were going to do it all over again, we probably would not have given him a phone until he was 16 or 17. But as it was, we gave him a smartphone in fifth grade so that we could contact him wherever, whenever. But as he has gotten older, we have relaxed time and app restrictions and he has only started to abuse it (adults are guilty of this too, of course). Looking at his screen time report, 5 hours per day is normal. This just really gets under our skin because we have talked and talked to him about healthy limits. We want him to exercise the healthy limits himself without us having to put restrictions back on the phone, but he resents that greatly and it seems to damage the relationship (he says, I am 15, I am old enough!). It does not help the fact that his friends\u2019 parents seem to care little or not at all about their children\u2019s time on their phones so Ben compares his lack of freedom to their total freedom. We also are fully aware of the algorithms of apps like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and how they suck your attention and brain away for hours if you let them. Of course his TikTok feed is full of pretty girls showing off their bodies, which is normal for a fifteen-year-old boy, but also not in line with the values we teach about not objectifying women and cultivating relationships over living in constant lust, ogling women all the time. We did remove Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok to help him reorient his focus and bring down his screen time, but we are not putting other time or app limits on the phone.\n\nThe bigger problem we have is his lack of respect for us. Ben has gone from a sweet boy that we can count on to a rude and disdainful teen that resents us. Ben will cut us off and snap at us when we are talking to him. My wife and I both have short tempers and we have played our part in escalating the situation when we should have been a more calming adult presence. We are working on this and we talk together about how we can improve. Incidentally, my wife and I have a very healthy marriage and we communicate and strategize on how best to work with Ben as his parents to get the best possible outcome.\n\nI understand that our punishments play a part in this, but now we are in this sad and dramatic standoff where we remove privileges from him (phone, sleepovers, etc.) until his attitude improves. His attitude will improve until we give him his phone back, and everyone relaxes and he sinks back into his phone, and things seem okay. But then something will come up and he will speak disrespectfully to his mom and we will address it, and he does not listen and the cycle starts all over again. He ignores us, rolls his eyes, and seems to always need to get that last spiteful word in. Ben has been in trouble at school for sharing a racist meme and we also found pictures on his Instagram where he trespassed, got onto a school bus, and took pictures of himself and a friend on top of the school bus and posted to Instagram. I caught him in his room viewing porn last year through his Xbox. These are 15-year-old hijinks for sure, but they also are alarming in the sense of race sensitivity as well as respect for others\u2019 property and healthy relationships with the opposite sex. We have talked through these mistakes with him and he seems to have learned from them.\n\nRegarding the attitude and disrespect, we have spoken to other parents whose advice is to just keep taking things away until he behaves. This sounds good I guess, but also does not sound healthy. He is 15 after all and he will have to grow up eventually. Things have gotten so ugly around here lately that I actually worry whether or not we will have a good relationship with him when he is a grown man and that scares me. \n\nMy wife can be very forward and direct. When Ben is explaining something about his behavior and it is obviously a thin excuse, my wife will often reply sarcastically or laugh and this of course really gets under Ben\u2019s skin. He is thinking, why should I respect you when you clearly do not respect me? I often find myself as a peacemaker, trying to calm things down and settle everyone. Ben will often come to me alone and ask my advice and confide in me about why he thinks his mom is unfair and how it hurts him the way she treats him. I give him strategies to help communicate with her and I work with her to try and improve the way she communicates. But things just do not seem to be getting any better. And I have also lost my temper more than once, yelling and animatedly angry at him. \n\nThis is going on close to a year and our once very happy family is being pulled apart by this constant tug of war. Ben will use things against us that we have said in previous conversations and he is openly belligerent. It used to be, we would ask him to rake the leaves or cut the grass and he would just do it, no questions asked, with a smile on his face. Now, when we ask him anything like this, he asks why and pushes back until we get into a discussion on who the authority figure is in the house and it just ruins everything.  I worry about my twelve-year-old daughter who is in the room during some of these fights and I know it is not healthy for her to be exposed to all of this back-and-forth.\n\nPart of me wants to keep up with the punishments and force compliance, but the other part of me seems to know that he needs his freedom. He is a very lovable and handsome young man with a lot of friends, but that means he is also not humble at all and can be very conceited. Maybe let him act like this outside and let him learn some of the lessons on kindness and humility that we have been trying to teach him.\n\nHelp!",

They are now thirteen and fifteen. \n\nI wasn't sure if it was normal or not, the comments expressed that it wasn't, and advised me to put a stop to it. \n\nI got pretty spooked with the realisation that he can be put down as a sex offender. I had a conversation with my husband and then our son promptly. \n\nWe were both concerned although our son wasn't. He has a rose coloured view, I guess, and thinks we can simply explain to the police that he isn't doing anything wrong. We've explained that that won't work and, his then natural conclusion was, \"We just won't tell anyone.\"\n\nWe tried to explain that it would still pose risks, but he's sure it'll be fine.\n\nSo then we moved into more hands on territory - we started trying to limit contact, but it hasn't been going well. All its done is force them into having sex in other places.\n\nWe haven't cut him off from the condom supply because we don't want them to be having unsafe sex.\n\nI'm at a loss. They're unsupervised a bit because they're teens and I have three younger children. I don't know how to sort this out? Just let them go as they please and hope for the best?\n\nAnd, yes, I've spoken to his girlfriends parents and they aren't bothered.

I starting doing the friends only camp outs around her age when I was a 15 year old high school freshman, but I'm pretty hesitant to allow her to go. \n\nShe's really responsible and has a good head on her shoulders.  She talks openly with us about pressures of sex, alcohol, fitting in, etc.  So it's less of a trust thing and more of an age and lack of safety support thing.  None of her friends are driving age yet, so in an emergency they're stuck.  \n\nThey're all a pretty responsible group, though.  No cliff jumping guys or pyromaniacs.  I've taken them camping as a group before earlier this summer and they mostly just like to swim, sunbathe, make s'mores over the fire, laugh about stupid adolescent jokes, etc.  I've been there to supervise but mostly I just hang back and let them do their thing while I read a book.\n\nAfter talking it over as parents we're considering proposing the compromise of me dropping her and her friends off at a camping spot and driving to the next spot down the road ~1/2 mile away in the area I used to go as a teen.  That way we're giving some independence to prove they can be responsible on their own but I'm solo camping in walking distance if they need help.  Unsupervised, but in reach. \n\nShe'd likely be somewhat disgruntled with the proposal but accept it.  Other parents might put the kibosh on it in any case though.  My daughter really wants it to happen, and her friends would enjoy it, but other parents might be less indulging than us even with myself sleeping a half mile away.  Maybe, in that case,  we could do an adult site and teen site separated by the half mile so other parents were also \"not supervising\" nearby? \n\nAny thoughts or input?",

We just assumed maybe someone had a partner or something and dropped it.\n\nWe've always been very open to sexual discussions and things with our teen, and four days ago, asked his dad a question about a sexual desire he has.

We had our son when we were twelve (he isnt my husbands son biologically, but husband has been involved hos entire life).\n\nHis girlfriends parents have the same age gap and have been together since they were ten and twelve and don't see anything wrong with it.

We found out that out teen has been on social media catfishing another teen, identifying themselves as the opposite sex, using their half siblings name. This has been going on for over the past year. They have displayed negative behavior online in the past and within this home social media was taken away. However, while having visitation every other weekend with the other bio parent social media was allowed and the negative behaviors ignored. As time has passed the co parenting relationship got worse and a device was provided we didn\u2019t know about. Every video made, viewed by 130,000 followers + on TikTok, contains suicide idealization, wanting to harm others, or wanting to self harm such as cut. The direct messages include detailed lies of physical abuse that grow worse and worse in the past three months and a strong fixation of wanting to kill me, the step mom, as I am home 24/7 and very much a part of  enforcing rules that are tested often. This has been so surreal and very hard. When picking up the teen this past Sunday they began to hit themselves so we felt we had no choice but to take them to the emergency room and not wait until our court date in July for a hearing on modifying the parenting plan and requesting assistance. After providing the social worker during the evaluation with the teens phone and explaining the details of the concerns, actions and how we have been having to live our teen was admitted into a behavioral facility for treatment. This is one of the scariest situations I have ever faced in my life. I have no idea if the confusion of no consequences at the non custodian parents home vs consequences at the custodian parents home is causing this, but it just can\u2019t be with as serious as the lies get.as well as how the teen mimics personalities immediately. I feel just horrible. I know this is better for our teen than continuing to hurt others, and taking a risk of actually hurting herself or hurting us, possibly trying to kill me. It is really hard with the bio mom and others stating to us that this is an effect of our teen being BORED FROM NOT HAVING SOCAIL MEDIA. All the while they did have without our knowledge.

        "content": "A little bit of background:\n\nIn 2020, ex-husband and I were still married. We opened our relationship, came out as polyamorous. We'd been together for 10 years, but would have this constant cycle of being good, then things go wrong, then we'd break up, spend some time apart and then get back together until cycle repeats. \n\nWhen we came out, I also had a secondary partner. I had dated him for about 4 months before my husband and I ended up going through our cycle again. (It was nothing to do with polyamory) We ended up deciding on a divorce. Split up for two years.\n\nThe reason behind it was I struggled with mental health and identity issues because of trauma as a child, teen and young adult and because I was a teen mom I never fully got the opportunity to face my trauma and heal and explore who I am as a person. \n\nFast forward end of 2021, We have 5 kids together. One of my cousins cousins moves in to help watch the kids as a baby sitter. she seemed cool. I had never met her before. Apparently her and exhusband slept together but he told her it was supposed to be sex, she caught feelings and wanted more. We were on the verge of getting back together but because I am pursuing my degree, i live on campus so we planned on taking things slow...(I wouldnt move back in immediately) He doesnt have much support and he works full time and she basically put him in the position of she wanted to date or shed leave and if she left he would have nobody for the kids and lose his job. Daycare is expensive for how much he makes and we tried applying for govt help with it but because of covid it was incredibly delayed. \n\nShe was very friendly and would hang out with me but as soon as they started dating she became distant from me. she didnt want to be around me. she told him that she didnt want me at their house(My name is on that lease), when shes around she hangs on him in front of me and the kids and if he so much as says anything to me (could be just a normal thing) she wants him and her to take the kids home. \n\nShe has the kids on a schedule and I have saturdays with them but she keeps planning stuff for them on saturdays \n\nMy oldest child especially is taking the divorce very hard and even blaming her. He doesnt see his father and I together unless she is present and she wont let him speak to me even in a friendly manner. \n\nI had suggested to exhusband that along with family therapy every so often we take the kids to go do something, just him and I so they can see us coparent civilly and other times with her involved. He agreed, and I even told the plan to my ex-MIL. MIL talked to the gf about it in attempt to help her understand that the kids needs are important and something triggered her and now she is telling exhusband that anywhere he goes with me she goes too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS. He said he doesn't want to be with her and he doesnt want to use her either, he feels terrible and stuck. He wants to work things out with me and I feel the same way, but were trying to figure out how to navigate without everything crumbling underneath. \n\nAlso pretty sure that gf knows her relationship isnt going to be long term because everyone told her not to date him because we were planning on getting back together and because not even 2 months into their relationship she mentioned marriage and wanting kids of her own and he doesnt want to remarry or have more kids(he has a vasectomy and even upset her by going to the dr to check and see if its still working)\n\nRight I am keeping the peace, being respectful, Ive tried just having a common conversation with her, and invited her out to do things, she feels like wall. Im not sure what else I can do. My biggest worry though is how to navigate this for the best interest of the kids. I feel they need to see their mom and dad be able to be around each other civilly without someone else in the mix hanging all over him.",

We've had some issues in our family, she's went through many major changes at home plus puberty is a confusing time. She started off with telling me she was gay and I told her if she was I love and accept her etc. Well, now she likes a boy and decided she was trans. That's fine if she is. I sort of thought it was a phase and maybe it is or isn't but she started going by a masculine name at school. We just picked out swimsuits and since she was acting very serious about it I thought she might want to wear swim trunks or something. Nope 2 piece bikini. She wore a skirt the other day and picked a dress up today at the store (which she hates now but if you have kids you know how that goes sometimes). I asked her if she still felt like she was trans (just checking in) and she said that boys can wear dresses to. Which I suppose is true I said but she got mad at me for asking. I told her I don't know much about it and basically I wasn't questioning who she is or anything, I love her no matter what. \n\nThat's all a bit confusing but I figure if I love and support her she will figure out who she is and as long as she's happy great. \n\nHere's the part I don't know how to handle whatsoever. Her cycle is due so right now so the attitude is at its worst. Having pms is not an excuse to get away with treating people poorly but I think its part of the reason why she is in a worse mood. She keeps saying things that I'm sure most kids in my era would have got smacked for and she's very dramatic. She would rather die then eat or wear certain clothes (I almost have to laugh at that such a typical tween/teen comment). She says \"Whatever\" to me more times then I can count. She complains so, so much. And she tells me no sometimes. I very much wanted to raise her to be a strong person but wow. She takes things I've taught her and tries to turn them around on me like how it's ok to say no. I did not mean to me about cleaning her room lol.\n\nNormally I might do loss of privileges but I just took away her devices. I had downloaded a parenting app but couldn't get it to work and decided to make sure she was being safe online. I sort of trusted she was following safety rules. She got on a muslim dating site (we are not muslim not that it matters) and started a freaking profile (never talked to anyone). She blamed her friend that stayed the night. For reference she is generally a good kid, behaves at school, no drugs alcohol or sex. She said her and her friend created it as a joke/bored and then she started crying. I stayed calm but maybe I shouldn't have? I told her no more internet for the foreseeable future and then she got mad at me. \n\nI'm just at a loss. Is this testing boundaries? Acting out for attention? Something else? I feel the need to tread carefully on the identity thing but the rest of it? We are getting into therapy but there is a wait list, I've tried calling several places.\n\nPart of me thinks maybe more quality time would help the other part of me thinks maybe I need to come down harder maybe both but I don't know how exactly. I don't want to damage our relationship, stress her out but I need to help her know these behaviors are out of line. She should know they are she didn't act like this before. \n\nIn the past I've used rewards, loss of privileges and just guiding her but she feels like I know absolutely nothing about anything and \"whatevers\" me when I try to talk to her.",

He has, however, had to endure several cringy conversations including how pornography is entertainment for adults and is just as unrealistic as horror or action movies and can negatively affect how he feels about women and sex in general at his age. \n\nI have no problem with him going through the same growing pains and experiences that we all went through, and I want to offer him more of an explanation than, \u201cbecause I said so\u201d when he questions his parents. On the other hand, I want to thump him in the eyeball and tell him that he\u2019s being a creepy fucker. \n\nWhen we explained the difference between flirting and sexual harassment, he didn\u2019t seem convinced. When we explained the possible consequences, he seemed unfazed. \nI don\u2019t want to go so far as to add a spy app to his phone, but I know that if I do simple spot checks now, I will be looking at heavily edited material. \n\nSo\u2026 is it reasonable for me to disallow him to delete content from his phone and hand out consequences if/when he does? Or is that overstepping boundaries for his age? What is your opinion? I appreciate all feedback.",

        "content": "I'm looking for advice from other parents in similar circumstances with their teenage kids. \n\nI'm a stepfather to a 15 year old son. While I haven't had a large part in raising him into the human he is today, I have tried my best to be a positive influence in his life. He does not know his dad and he never will. \n\nI've known his mother for about ten years and after several years of dating, we decided it was time to make serious commitments in our relationship. We recently moved in together, bought a house, and we had my first biological child, an amazing baby girl (5 months). \n\nHe did go through some serious trauma as a child at the hands of his mother's family, although we barely found out a year ago. We've distanced ourselves from their side of the family since and he's been in therapy since we found out. \n\nThat said, as a 6th grader he'd already discovered porn. And his vices grew exponentially ever since. \n\nHe's been having sex since 13/14 as far as we know. Unfortunately, he views sex as a mere transaction for pleasure, nothing more. 3 of the first girls he had sex with he didn't even know prior to finding them on Snapchat and organizing a hookup. \n\nHe's also a serial liar and manipulator. He drinks and smokes. He self harms and he has anger management issues. \n\nWe've tried all sorts of approaches from understanding and conversation to accountability and consequences, but we can't seem to break through to him. Regardless of whether we spoil him or not, it seems his only motive in life is to make poor decisions resulting from his severe selfishness. \n\nLately, he's been skipping school to smoke with his gf and have sex in a sewer. I doubt he's using protection. \n\nHe recently acted out via self harming and after his mother and I attempted to talk to him about how things escalated for him so quickly, he ended up threatening me physically and it all ended in the police searching for him for an hour before he was transported to the ER and a one week stay in a mental facility. This is in fact the second time he's been admitted for at least a week in the last 3 months. \n\nThat said, he's not your typical troublemaking teen. He's extremely smart and takes all advanced courses. He's normally a straight A student without much effort and he's extremely talented artistically. \n\nHe simply hates any sort of control and structure. He hates authority and he thinks as parents, our purpose is not to help and guide him, but rather to accept his poor choices and provide him the means to make more poor choices regardless of what that means for him, us, or anyone else. \n\nI'm having an extremely hard time relating to him in this respect because I was the exact opposite at his age under far worse circumstances. My parents struggled to make ends meet. My father worked two jobs and my mom worked equally hard for us to still be lower class living in a very dangerous neighborhood. We probably had about 5 serious drug dealers on our block of about 20 houses. I had a ton of freedom because my parents had to work so much, yet I rarely abused it. I was a straight A kid and I kept out of trouble and respected my parents and loved them dearly even when they disciplined me. \n\nIt seems our teen son and all his friends mirror each other in terms of their problems and poor decisions, even though most of not all come from upper middle class families now. Parenting today is definitely not what it was back in the 80s and 90s. It feels like the kids dictate the parents these days and it feels completely wrong. \n\nGranted, I know a lot of this is related to him being raised by a single mother who had him when she was 15. That'd be tough for anyone but truth be told. She's a wonderful mother. She's loving, caring, dedicated, driven and provided for her son well given the circumstances. Did she make some major mistakes. Sure. But no one is perfect and some of what's been dealt their way could never have been predicted. \n\nThis post has gotten pretty long but I'm trying to give as much background and detail as possible in hopes of getting good advice. \n\nAt this stage, we're in survival mode. We're hoping he graduates a year early so he can gain the freedom he says he craves. Until then, we're doing our best to balance keeping him safe vs keeping him happy without completely dismissing our family values and morals in the process of doing so. \n\nIt's simply difficult to care at all about his happiness when he stages conversations for us to see with his friends about \"helping each other be better,\" all as a front to keep doing illegal things.  At this time, he doesn't know we can see all his text conversations regardless of whether he deletes them. Everyday, he lies about very serious things and he's deleting the majority of his conversations or actions via text, then comes home and puts on a show expecting us to spoil him or pat him on the back. \n\nIs this normal teen behavior these days? I've been ready to throw down the hammer, take away his phone and PS4, and get extremely rigid with rules, etc until we see actual change, but my wife lives in a constant state of fear that any rules or consequences will result in self harm. He obviously has manipulated his way into this position of power with her. \n\nThoughts? Advice?",

I tried to get custody of her but the courts decided that she was a danger to others (I had a new partner and we had a baby) I stayed in contact trying to build a relationship with her via letters but she got jealous of a photo of our cat. Contact was lost until she turned 18 recently. Her now Foster mother called me and told me she is in a psychiatric unit being treated for sadistic narcissistic psychopathy.

Last year she was caught smoking a vape on the school bus. She lied straight to our faces about it. My wife and I talked to her and disciplined her. She\u2019s a liar, so we\u2019ve been helping her work on that. She thought about suicide, so we talked to a therapist.

I would suggest you continue with counseling for her and for yourself/family counseling.\n\nA 12 year old having sex is pretty serious IMO. She\u2019s not in any position to handle becoming pregnant, and emotionally she could be setting up some bad coping mechanisms.\n\nI agree with the other poster who mentioned that you should separate the 2 issues. One, sneaking around and 2 having sex at such a young age.\n\nThe sneaking around is a trust issue and you need to find a way to build trust with her and she with you. I think this why therapy is really important. \n\nThe sex issue is something you need to discuss on all sorts of levels. First, how old is her boyfriend and perhaps you need to involve his parents. 2nd you absolutely need to have her talk with a pediatrician/gynecologist, you do not want her getting pregnant, so a birth control discussion is very important along with STD talks. 3rd, the emotional part of sex, again I think this is where a therapist would be helpful. \n\nForbidding things as parent only works to an extent and can cause huge issue as time goes on, but establishing healthy parent/child boundaries is essential. So I guess my biggest suggestion is therapy, therapy, therapy.",

        "content": "I need some advice and perspective please.  I discovered that my(43 F) teen daughter (15 F) cut herself.  She doesn't want me to tell her dad (47 M).  He and I co-parent 50/50, but it's a little rocky at times.  I need perspective and advice on both, PLEASE!  Details below.\n\nShe had come to me the night before talking about girls at school and how she sees cuts on some girls and it's like no one ever cares.  She asked me if I had ever self harmed.  I told her no, not in that way.  Although sometimes when I'm super upset or angry, that I have reacted with violence, like breaking my phone by throwing it and that I find that to be a version of self harm.  I asked her what she thought about cutting and she seemed like she couldn't understand why someone would do that.  The next day, I had a weird horrible feeling.  She normally wears shorts and she was wearing sweatpants all day.  But I didn't know if I should ask her directly, or just talk to her some more about cutting specifically.  Then later, I was sitting by her, and through a hole in her pants, I saw a perfectly straight scratch on her leg and I asked about it.  Turns out she admitted to scratching her leg with a push pin in a moment of anger over drawing.  She says it the only time she's ever done that.  That she felt stupid and immediately regretted it.  That she immediately looked up healthy and productive ways to express frustration and anger.  She said it was three tiny scratches that she could barely see at the time and that they looked much worse the next day.  She is very embarrassed and it took a while to calm her down.  That night, she told me she knew I would have to tell her dad, but that she would like to tell him first.  I said that I was okay with that.  It was very late and we were both pretty tired and drained, so we agreed on tomorrow.  \n\nThe next day I asked when she was going to talk to her dad.  She said she wanted to text him when he was awake.  I could tell that she was very upset and anxious about telling her dad.  I talked to her to find out why she's afraid and to try to calm her.  On the one hand, she says that it was three small scratches to see if cutting was helpful, because she sees other kids with cut marks, and that she thinks its stupid after trying it, regretted it and that she would rather go for a run to deal with frustration in the future.  \n\nOn the other hand, her dad is sometimes very difficult to deal with and I know what she means when she says to me \"you know how he is.\"  Obviously, he's my ex (split more that 10 years ago), so it's no surprise that there are aspects of his personality that I find difficult to deal with.  But as a father to a teen girl, I have been pretty surprised by him, and not it a good way.  Turns out he has quite a few beliefs, that are rather misogynistic for lack of a better word.  He seems very domineering, and particularly with his children.  I've seen him just run over her with words, berate her and lecture in a long winded manner.  So I understand why she's hesitant, I really do.\n\nMy thoughts on the cutting.  Obviously, I'm super concerned.  I do believe that it's the first time she did that.  I believe her when she says she regretted it immediately, and appreciated that she looked into productive ways to express anger, she talked about exercise, or intentional relaxation, like yoga or a shower.  \n\nI already have her in therapy.  She had started seeing a therapist at the beginning of October.  I felt she needed someone that she could talk to, maybe even talk about her parents.  She had been complaining of being \"anxious\" over the past year - which seemed normal, because its been a crazy couple of years with the pandemic.  She also has been struggling with her dad and I splitting time 50/50 now, rather than before, where I had her during the week and he had weekends.  My secret hope was that she would find her voice and be able to have some assertiveness when it came stating her position on things in life.  She says she told her counselor in the last couple minutes of their session and so he said they would talk about it next time.    \n\nIdeally, I think her dad should know.  I would want to know, if the tables were turned and this is something he dealt with at his home.  It's tough to say though from her perspective, because her dad and I are not equal parents.  He has never, and still doesn't, handle many details of her life.  He has never taken her to the doctor, dentist.  He has never bought her school clothes.  He doesn't meet her friends, or their parents.  He doesn't talk to her, about peer pressure, sex, drugs, friends, success, ambition.  I could go on.  But suffice to say, that when our daughter has a problem, she comes to me.  \n\nWhat do I do??",

        "content": "Hi all. Posting here because not really sure who else to talk to or where else to get advice from. Not very keen on telling people in the family as of right now but feeling overwhelmed. \n\nI'm a single mum to my eldest daughter (16), and two younger girls (5 & 4) and, as the title says, my oldest daughter has just told me she's pregnant after being sent home from school for feeling unwell. I'm fortunate enough that we have a close enough relationship for her to come to me with this. I had her myself when I was 17 so we're somewhat close in age and we do have a really good relationship. Her father isn't around and has been completely out of the picture since she was three years old. He has no contact and don't pay towards anything. I've raised her alone (with the help of my parents, of course). \n\nIn the middle of summer, she had told me that she had been experimenting with sexual activity (we are in the UK and she is of the age of consent) and was thinking about having sex with her boyfriend. So we had a conversation about it and I took her to the doctors for the contraceptive pill so that she was prepared for when she did decide to have sex. I also bought her some condoms for protection against STI's. I've met the boyfriend on a number of occasions, however, I haven't allowed any overnight sleepovers under my roof. Whether she has at his house I don't know; if she has, she hasn't been open about that with me. To my knowledge, she hasn't and I would like to trust her on that. I am also very aware that teenagers will seek out places and opportunities to have sex as I was one myself. \n\nI've had the conversation with her about how she got pregnant. I made sure that it was all consensual, that the father is her boyfriend, and asked how this has happened. She says she has been taking the contraceptive pill daily as she was told to by the doctor, but I suspect she's either missed some, or not been taking them at the same time everyday. \n\nNow, my real issue is that I don't know how to support her in this. I'm quite heartbroken for her to be very honest; I know that this is ultimately her choice, and one of the first things that she told me was that she wanted to keep this baby. The father doesn't and has said he wants nothing to do with either of them but I wanted so much more for her, especially after I had been in this situation. I know the struggle of being a teen parent, I know the struggle of having to make the decision between a termination and becoming a teen parent, I know just how difficult this is. I definitely paid the price for my choices as I work a minimum wage dead end job, I didn't get to go off to university with all my friends and progress. I truly did want the world to be her oyster. I know for a fact that the responsibility to pay for this child is going to fall on me and I just can't logistically do it. Taking on more hours means that I won't be able to be there and support her as she will need me to, and also means I miss out on more time with my other two daughters. I struggle as it is; I am a single mum to three children, running a house on minimum wage whilst also paying off some debts which I accrued whilst younger. \n\nI'm honestly just lost at what to do here. I want to support her, I'm unsure of how to or how I realistically can.",

If not, I recommend doing so, and sharing it with her. Put together a list of pregnancy and baby expenses (short term and long term) you can think of. Compare these expenses to your budget now. Maybe even estimate what kind of an income she would likely be looking at for herself, if she were to try and get a job. She will see that the numbers don\u2019t add up.\n\nWhat the two of you decide to do at that point is between the two of you. But she needs to have all the information to understand the situation.",

He claimed he told HER he wasn\u2019t ready to have sex until he was \u2018like a senior or something\u2019 but we\u2019re going to the drug store anyway so he\u2019ll be used to condom shopping by the time he\u2019s ready to use one. That made sense to him. Dad always tells him \u2018Noah didn\u2019t build the ark after it started to rain, Son\u2019 to which he always replies \u2018Who\u2019s Noah, Dad?\u2019 since we aren\u2019t much into religion.  He also told me he talked to her a lot about what she was comfortable with and checked in with her about what she enjoyed and what she didn\u2019t.  His awareness of consent has definitely improved. We talked about what Dad and I want for him - which is to give him a safe space to make healthy, smart, safe, respectful decisions. Not just respectful to his partner of choice but also respectful to the other people in this house. He was NOT happy with the thought of walking in on parents doing what he\u2019d been doing!  Oh and his GFs dad found out they were dating when he overheard her on the phone with a friend so that solves that issue!\n\n\nAll in all, so far, so good. Thank you everyone for your advice! It helps so much to have a sounding board.  Who knows what he\u2019ll end up doing but I feel better knowing I\u2019m giving him some tools to help make decisions - even if he chooses not to use them lol.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "I think your son's autism makes this a more complicated answer than it would be with a normal kid. How severe, what are his triggered behaviors, etc. \n\nBut the most important question here is, can you trust him? If you set boundaries or make an agreement, does he stick to it? Because if the answer is yes, and if he's relatively uninhibited (which it sounds like he is), then you can have a transparent conversation that lets you create a plan you can live with, and that lets him grow and have fun and learn and explore. \n\nIs the girl autistic? Would her family know that he's autistic? These may also be important considerations to protect your son from a misunderstanding, or to protect her.  At this age it *may* still be appropriate for to call the girl's parents... but talk to your son about it first.\n\nIs he in a special ed program? Is there a social worker or psychologist keeping track of him? Talk to them as well. \n\nIf he's not trustworthy, you have a much more difficult path ahead of you, and it will *definitely* involve communicating with the girl's parents.",

        "content": "My 14 (almost 15) year old daughter is a freshman in high school this year. She has always been very mature for her age and we have always had very open communication. We talk on a daily basis about her life, the lives of the kids around her and the things they do drugs, sex (makes me want to scream, but I let her talk about them as it seems like she frowns on their activities). She has always been comfortable coming to me with the most sensitive of subjects. \n\nLast night, she said she was invited to a party and wanted to go. The girls she knows are on her volleyball team but are a little older than her - they are sophomores. Without me asking a thing, she spouted off details. She said the parents will be there and flay out told me there will be alcohol at the party. She said boys are staying the night so I want you to pick me up. I stared off into space for a moment trying to let this all process.\n\nI have always told her that I know she is going to do things I don't approve of but please just always call me to get you - no questions asked. \n\nI have considered ground rules. No drinking, no drugs, stay with a buddy the entire night, open your own drinks, do not leave with anyone, etc.\n\n I would really appreciate any advice.\n\nI am so grateful for all of the responses! \n\nI guess my biggest concern is her never letting me in on anything else and doing it anyway. She has told me how her friends are jealous and tell her how lucky she is because she doesn't have to lie and sneak like they do. I'm sure she still does occasionally, but she really does tell me a lot - even things that make make want want claw my own eyes out. She even had me set up a Life 360 so I always know where she is! Her friends wanted to sneak out one night to walk a mile up the road from her friend's house. She texted me immediately asked me to download it but didn't say why. I did and the next day she told me they wanted to sneak out but she wasn't comfortable so she said I was watching her location on life 360 and showed them her app. I was so impressed... I don't want all of that to go down the drain and have to worry about where she is or who she is with and if she is safe. I am so thankful that she shares everything and I do not think she has any bad intentions. She's a real smart kid and she's really smart about weird people and being aware of her surroundings. To Catch a Predator is one of her favorite shows she watches on YouTube and she is always telling me how her friends need to be more careful on social media and such. I just feel like she has a lot of common sense and she could have just gone and said she was going with a friend for the night after the dance and I would have never known. I do not want this to be the beginning of that because that's exactly what I did and my mother would not have known where to start searching for my body!\n\nUpdate: The party is this coming Saturday and I have agreed to let her go with conditions:\n\n1. She received a long lecture on alcohol (and drugs) as well as reminders of how it effects your judgment and might impact her participation in sports. She was also reminded that being cool is being confident in yourself and you do not need to do anything to prove your worth to anyone. We discussed the horror stories I read about high school/college kids and the accidental deaths from alcohol poisoning. \n\n2. She is not to leave the house until I am in the driveway to pick her up. \n\n3. She is to have a buddy with her at all times and not be anywhere alone.\n\n4. She must open any and all of her drinks. If she opens a coke and sets it down and turns her back on it, she's to throw it out and get a new one. \n\n5. She is to check in with me every hour or I will crash the party. \n\n6. She has to keep her phone fully charged so I can see her location on Life 360.\n\n7. If for any reason she feels uncomfortable, she is to use me as an excuse and say I'm making her go home early and I'll go get her. \n\nI am always open to other ideas as well. I appreciate everyone's comments and concerns. I will update after the party and let everyone know how it goes! Thank you all again so much!\n\nUpdate: \n\nSo after the dance a lot of the kids were on a party bus that was transporting all of them to and from. They went to a local restaurant afterward - one of the parents reserved a room for them to have dinner. Some insane woman who also had a party there offered the kids to go finish what was left over at her party and offered to buy the kids alcohol - most of the kids ran to this back room and began drinking the pitchers of margaritas. My daughter called me from the bathroom in disbelief and told me this. I asked if she had a drink. She said \"mom I would never drink in public are you insane. If I want a drink, I'll wait until we get to the party\".  Smart decision - and not following the crowd - happy mama for that! \n\nShe they then went from there to the girl's house for the party and had an amazing time. She fessed up to having a few drinks. I spoke to her a few times through the night because she  kept calling me to tell me stupid things other kids were doing and I would not have known if she had not told me. No one did anything dangerous they were just loud and annoying. She sounded completely sober and completely appropriate. I frowned at her because I do not necessarily approve of her drinking, but she said proudly \"I paced myself and I never actually felt drunk mom. There were kids acting like complete idiots and the one was throwing up everywhere. I just sipped my drink and talked with my friends while they were all on the other side of the room taking a bunch of shots and acting stupid.\" \n\nSo my assessment - I hate hate hate that my daughter drank and I wish I could prevent it altogether. Based on my experience as a teen with my mom and step-dad and how strict they were, I can assure you she will find her way as I did if she really wants to do something. I cannot recall one thing they forbid me to do that I didn't actually do. I was rebellious and I found a way to do what I wanted. I am being realistic and I could not ask for a better scenario. \n\nI am proud of her. 1. I am proud that she had the courage to fess up. 2. I am proud of the way she handled herself at the party. 3. I feel like she definitely learned some lessons from watching the kids that were getting smashed and being obnoxious. 4. I feel she is confident enough in herself that she does not need to be a follower or easily give in to peer pressure. \n\nShe said she had a great time and would go to a party again but maybe not with as many people. She really didn't care for people being loud and obnoxious. \n\nWhile I was a nervous wreck the entire night, practically sitting on my hands so I didn't call over and over, I am so glad I let her go. It was a great experience for her and it sort of broke the ice for me as well. My daughter is a very social person and she is also stubbornly independent, as she has been since could walk and talk. I think she has a sense of freedom, respect and trust from me. So much that she asked again, as she had asked for 6 months, can she go to the tanning bed -  I smiled and said \"No fucking way\" (BTW we are now spray tanning but she was testing the waters lol). See, I still say no when needed.... Thank you so much to everyone!",

Please take a look into state laws of your country. they differ quite a lot and can get both you and your son into serious trouble. Here in Germany the age of consent is 16, but is tolerated for 14+ if both partners are of similar age.\n\nother countries and states have stricter laws with the age of consent being 16 or even 18. That means, no matter how nice and caring your son is, the partner's parents can sue your son for sexual asault even if the intercourse was consentual. You would be sued too, because allowing it to happen under your roof will make you equally guilty.\n\nThat is the law part. But apart from that, you are right. If he is allowed sex in a peaceful, safe environment, it would be much safer. \"Quick, my parents will be home soon\" has probably caused a lot of babies.",

        "content": "My SO and I have always tried to be laid back parents. Our 13 yo has had very few expectations from us, probably too few as we've giving him unlimited screen time and enjoy his life as he pleases; we've merely asked him to do his best in school (he's always been an A student although he has an ADD diagnosis that he has chosen himself to not treat medically) and to not lie to us, but instead talk to us about whatever is bothering him. We've encouraged him to ask questions about pretty much everything in life, including sex and relations, and we'll answer truthfully, not about personal stuff, but generally speaking.\n\nIt's been going well up to around this past Xmas. But the past months, something has felt off about him. We figured it was raging teen hormones, but he just didn't feel like our old kid anymore. Something was off and we couldn't figure out what was off. He pretty much shut us down when we asked if something was wrong. He duped us for months until everything came to a head last week.\n\nOkay, first a needed backstory: The deal we've had since he got his own phone two tears ago, was that he can't have his phone in his room when he goes to bed. Several nights, he said he didn't know where it was when we asked to have it to charge it in the living room. We accepted it, because he lever lies. But one night last week, my husband got a weird feeling (I'd already been getting a weird feeling about the missing phone but couldn't figure it out) and caught our son red handed hiding the phone under his pillow after telling my husband to look in the bathroom. This was the first time ever we caught him lying and our son just went quiet and couldn't come up with an explanation.\n\nTurns out, he and one of his female friends started a \"secret relationship\" and I put that in quotes because he's been in distance learning since March last year and hasn't seen any of his friends irl since then. She made him promise not to tell anyone, including us, because of a self harming ex of hers. So we knew nothing.\n\nThe relationship has changed him, to say the least. He repeatedly stopped handing in his assignments and doing his hw. Suddenly, F after F popped up in his grades. He'd \"forgotten\" to turn them in. He'd handed them in but somehow, they got lost or \"unturned in\". When asked, he always said he'd done his hw. When the Fs started to show up, he always assured us he'd fix it, he'd email his teacher and take care of it. We accepted it, because he never lies.\n\nThe morning after, he finally told us about the secret relationship and how she wouldn't text him first and kept playing mind games, how he was feeling sad all the time, how he gets panic attacks and constantly feels stressed (but mind you, he has lots of time to actually work, he just...doesn't) how nothing about school felt important and that nothing felt meaningful anymore. We promised him to get him the help he needs (we have an appointment with his pediatrician this week) and asked him to strongly reconsider the relationship with his gf. We also explained how important it is to be honest and truthful, how hard it is to regain trust once you've lost it and how hard he will have to work to make us trust him again.\n\nWe sat up with him two nights until midnight in a row to help him with all the missing assignments before the trimester deadline, we took him for long walks to talk through stuff he was worried about, we really thought we had a breakthrough.  He was of course grounded and we took away both his phone and computer. However, we let him keep his school Chromebook, because he needs it to do his work. We also emailed his teachers to explain that he is going through some stuff right now, but that we are working on it and that we're keeping a close eye on him.\n\nAnd then we caught him lying about having done his hw again last night. See, now we're suspicious and had checked his google classroom and his Securly (something we've NEVER done before because we trusted him and wanted to respect his privacy) and found that he'd been mostly looking at pointless shit on youtube while \"working\" is his room. When we saw the empty documents and the \"turn in\" button still lit, we asked him where his hw was. He kept up the lying; the document he'd worked on was \"somewhere else\" but, he couldn't show us where. Finally, he admitted that he hadn't done it because there where so many words he didn't understand (Industrial Revolution in Social Studies) and he didn't want to ask us for help and he figured he'd just do it tomorrow instead. We were so incredibly disappointed in him for lying again. He KNOWS we have his back if he just asks us for help, why does he still pull this shit? And yeah, he still seems to feel bad when getting caught, but it's just a question of time before lying becomes normalized to him and he won't feel bad about lying, just about being caught and that's easily fixed by becoming an even better liar.\n\nSo this is where we are today. He's not allowed to sit in his room for distance learning but is instead placed in the dining room where we can keep an eye on him. We are considering removing the door to his room because he can obviously not be trusted to do his work in there with the door shut. (He's had his door shut since December, whe he started acting all sneaky.) And to me, it feels like I have an  acquaintance's son visiting that I'm not very comfortable around. He just doesn't feel like my old, great kid anymore. It's killing me.\n\nSo, if you've made it this far, what the hell do I do to fix this? How can we get through to him? Can a depression show this way? I've had depressions on and off since I was 15 and always knew there's a possibility he'd inherit my shitty gene, but apart from the anxiety attacks, he's not behaving that way I was, because we're all different. He's never been an easy going kid, but we've always been able to talk and communicate with him and I feel I just don't know him anymore and it has kicked in my own anxiety gear. Is my husband and I exaggerating the problem? Do all teenagers lie and is it normal for a teenager to just stop caring about school and the future? And how will we ever be able to trust him again?",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "While I don't have a teenager, thinking back to his age and what I went through, it could be depression. I think the pediatrician visit is going to be a good thing. \n\nI'm going to go out on a limb here and also say he could be possessive of his GF and he just doesn't realize it. I struggled with that when I was 14. I would ask him if he is constantly worried about what his GF is doing, and I'd that lack of knowing what she is doing at all times is constantly on his mind. If so, start conversations about relationships, possessiveness, trusting others, etc. This is something I struggled with and didn't have any support for.\n\nI wouldn't take the door off either. He does need his space, and his privacy. If you remove his door he has no place to vent privately and that could lead to bottling up emotions.",

The information pertains less to pre-teens just on the outside edges of puberty, and I would love to dig into some psychology/science-based information in addition to anecdotal stories. \n\nThere are lots of thoughts swirling through my head: what does this mean? will he be trans? is this a phase? how will we handle the world? should we move to a bigger town? why do I feel so weird about this when I've always wanted him to be his wonderful self, including gender non-conformity if that was what he felt was right? \n\nLike, I know there aren't answers to these questions, but .... this is just a really big surprise I guess. \n\nHe's never been super masculine - not into competitive sports, for example - but he's always always wanted his hair short, preferred dark basic clothes (jeans/black t-shirts even when he was a toddler), etc. He did go to school with black nail polish a couple of times in the early elementary years, and stopped when he got some light teasing. Most of his friends are boys. Some of them have recently started talking about sex, and that has bothered my son and he has gravitated toward the boys who aren't really into that yet. He also has always liked soft fabrics - he asked for a velvet duvet cover this Christmas (but in super dark blue not like pink). \n\nAnd why am I talking about colors with gender in mind? I have never pushed \"boy\" colors or \"boy\" toys, always gave him the option for toys across the spectrum and whatever colors he wanted. Now I'm analyzing everything. \n\nThanks for reading and commenting.

        "content": "I have to laugh at times at the look on my husband\u2019s face when he hears me explaining things to my 11yo son. \n\nI have always tried to treat my son like the future adult he is. So when it came to things like our miscarriage, I told him the truth. He asked about how babies are made - we watched \u201cThe Great Sperm Race\u201d on YouTube and he got plenty of explanation about how it all works, with help from an anatomy manual.\n\nHis aunt died when he was 8, so I explained how the cancer developed and why her body stopped working. I showed him what we know and don\u2019t know about cancer. We talked about different belief systems around what happens after death, and held him when he went through his clingy stage when kids start realizing that everything dies in order for new life to begin. \n\nWhen he\u2019s being disciplined, he knows exactly why. It\u2019s no secret. For me, his compliance has to be about understanding and developing empathy for others, not about fearing retribution.\n\nHe asked about why his bio dad and I broke up, and what happened when my current husband and I parted ways for about 6 months early on, and I\u2019ve always taken an open and balanced approach with him, like his dad is a great person but sometimes people just grow apart and fit better with someone else. That we were both really sad when the other breakup happened but ultimately it needed to so we could grow up and figure out what we really wanted.\n\nMy husband now gets a little bug-eyed when I share some -privacy-protected- hypotheticals about relationships that I pick up from my counselling practice, because he feels like it\u2019s too adult for a kid. He protests a little, but generally lets me do my thing because he is the step parent, so he\u2019s still finding his role. \n\nI do it because I want our son to have a good perspective on what\u2019s healthy, what\u2019s fair. When I don\u2019t know something, my go-to is to say \u201cI don\u2019t know, but let\u2019s find out.\u201d \n\nMy parents were remarkably tight lipped about things they felt were too adult. I asked them how much money they made when I was 16 and they told me it was none of my business, and then in the next breath told me not to bother getting out of bed for less than 60k/year, therefore setting me up for some really skewed expectations about finance. They spent years trying to convince us about the existence of Santa and then around 9 it was just a switch flip like \u201coh you still believe that\u2019s real?\u201d I found out wrong info about sex at 12, had to get my info on birth control from teen magazines (which honestly was so valuable because I used that info to teach ALL my friends about them early on and who to talk to to get them - and we had no teen pregnancies among us). \n\nI did hear a lot about relationships from my mom, but not in the guided way you\u2019d expect where the parent gives perspective on right and wrong, but rather i heard all about how people in my family mistreated each other and I had to figure out through years of counselling and reflection how messed up that was.\n\nI guess the point of this post is that now we have a baby girl on the way, and I want to treat her the same way I have with my son. I want her to be able to develop a curious mind and never to be told that things about life that affect her are none of her business. I don\u2019t want her to be sheltered from reality, or spend her 20s trying to unlearn what she\u2019s been taught or feeling like her contribution to society as an individual is meaningless. I didn\u2019t know until I finished my university degree that what you do and what you write can change the world even when you\u2019re a teen. I never felt like I or what we did ever mattered enough.\n\nI\u2019m going to talk to my husband about what I\u2019ve said here because I want us to be on the same page, but at the same time, I\u2019m pretty certain nothing he can say will change my mind about this approach. \n\nTL;DR I am extremely open with information I share with my son. I\u2019ve never not answered a question or told him something is too adult for him to understand. Husband (his stepdad) struggles with feeling like kids should be a little more sheltered.

Fast forward to today. We\u2019ve allowed her to have a lot of control with her phone. She has Instagram, Reddit, etc. She hasn\u2019t been deleting texts. Or so I thought. I had a peek in her IG messages and found a ton of stuff, where she was talking to her boyfriend about wanting to \u2018cuddle without pants on\u2019 but in the next sentence telling him not to interpret that as wanting to have sex because she\u2019s not ready; indicating that she couldn\u2019t wait to \u2018walk down the aisle\u2019 with him one day and have his children, etc. I didn\u2019t mention it because I feel like this is the kind of stuff a lot of teens talk about and I realize she will eventually have sex and all I can do is make sure she\u2019s protected with BC and has safe sex. So she comes home from school today and I have her put her phone on my desk since she has a big paper to write and the phone is a complete distraction for her.

I\u2019ve always been open and honest with him about sex bc I wanna make sure he\u2019s not learning wrong information elsewhere. I remind him constantly to let me know when he\u2019s *considering* sex so I can make sure he has protection. I want him to be able to communicate w me, so he\u2019s not sneaking off and accidentally getting someone pregnant. My brother was a teen dad at 16 and he knows I don\u2019t want him in the same boat. \nProblem is: teenagers are teenagers. \nKid invited his gf over 2 weeks ago. Before her arrival I had a migraine and decided to take a nap w my toddler. I told him to make sure I\u2019m up when girl gets here. Never been an issue before. I wake up, she\u2019s already here and they\u2019re making out in his room w the lights off. As soon as I realize this, I remind them of the \u201clights on and keep the door open rule\u201d again. (You know, the usual) I sit in the living room and play w the toddler until girl leaves eventually. Living room and his bedroom are within eyeshot of each other. It\u2019s a very small house, I can see 99% of his room from the couch. Nothing seemed out of sorts. \nHop to yesterday, where girls mom contacts me and informs me they weren\u2019t just making out. She told me they were safe ab it (I guess he stole a condom from my husband god knows when, which I\u2019m happy he was smart ab it but uugghhh) but she wanted me to be aware. I did ask teenager ab it just to make sure it was true. He confirmed it and my heart was crushed. \nIdk y\u2019all, my kid is growing up too fast. 14 to me is too young to be sexually active. I was older than that for my first time and being a girl I had diff standards (religious family.) placed on me than my brother.\nI haven\u2019t told his dad yet bc kid said he\u2019d tell him himself.

To a mom who wasn\u2019t mentally ready for this leap yet, and/or to the teen? \n-What\u2019s the best knowledge y\u2019all can give me to pass on? \n-What do you wish someone would have told you when you first dove into the \u201cactive\u201d realm? \n\nI could give a girl advice all day, but for boys? I\u2019m so lost.

        "title": "Internet arms race with a 15 year old, what's reasonable?",
        "content": "(using an anonymous account as my son would easily find this otherwise)\n\nBackground: divorced family, 50/50 parenting time between houses, completely different rules and boundaries at each house. Our house is strong rules with accountability, a lot of coddling/enabling at the other house. My 15 year old (let's call him \"Fifteen\") is GT and exceptionally smart, while also extremely socially anxious. He has extremely compulsive behavior around using the internet and especially his phone, as I know most parents are seeing with their teens. We've been in essentially an internet arms race since he was about 12-13 and stumbled across violent, hardcore illustrated anthropomorphic (read: furry) porn while at his other parent's home (despite me begging them to enforce common sense device usage rules there, like not letting him use a phone past bedtime or alone in his room, which is how this started). I am pretty technically savvy as I've worked in networking and internet fields since the mid 1990s, so I know \"how it all works\" and just how much damaging garbage is out on the net and how easy it is to get to vs. the average parent. I've seen the darkest corners of the internet over decades, and the stuff I see him consuming today shocks me.\n\nI should note we are also very sex-positive and accepting and in our house. We believe consenting adults can do whatever they want as long as it doesn't hurt someone. I have no problems with furries, or kink of any kind, between adults. However, as a single example problem and to be blunt, consuming gangbang rape porn as a teenager is not just inappropriate but damaging his healthy sexuality, and quite possibly could destroy his future career options if any of this consumption is linked back to his actual identity (which is HIGHLY likely given that he's using free VPN software that is known to harvest personal identity info along with ALL device usage, among other malicious features). We also have several younger children that are probably catching exposure to some of this and finding too much age-inappropriate content from watching him.\n\nSo I've got router level filtering specific to devices at the hardware mac address, disable internet to those devices during night hours, installed monitoring filtering software (e.g. Qustodio) on devices, had him sign contracts, discussed it many many times, brought it up with his therapist, require his phone to be charged in a public space at night (i.e. not allowed his bedroom).\n\nHe will factory reset his device to remove the monitoring software, he is now using VPNs to tunnel through the router filtering, and at night turns his mobile phone (which his other parent promptly supplied and paid for after we took away his first phone for previous rule breaking, thanks #ParentOfTheYear) into a wi-fi hotspot so he can use his school laptop to connect to the internet after the parents go to sleep. I've caught him saving media to his computer that, if for example was discovered while he had it at school, would cause his immediate expulsion.\n\nHe thought he was getting away with all of this, but I've just been watching him to see what he does, and just confronted him about the most recent actions two days ago. I've tried to stay rational and explain the potential consequences for his own life of these choices, and also explain how he is destroying any trust in our relationship by his constant and proactive disrespect of the rules. Still, as of last night, I am catching him trying to end around with a new VPN on his phone.\n\nWhile my kneejerk reaction is to simply ban use of his own phone and only use his laptop for school work, I also recognize that his main bridge to social connection with peers is through his device and chat apps like Discord. He does also look for and find a lot of positive, valuable content that his natural curiosity and intellect would be starved of if I did this. Especially during this pandemic situation, if I cut him off from elective tech use, I'm essentially cutting him off from the last shred of socialization he has available. So I don't know what to do at this point, as he has no ability to self regulate and make better choices, and no matter what I do he's going to keep finding ways around it.\n\nI'll certainly be talking to his therapist about this. How are other parents balancing this generation's socialization need via tech against unhealthy consumption patterns, especially if you know they are getting into content that is extremely damaging? Any recommendations of content or media he or we could watch that would help him see for himself the need to be more responsible for himself and not just because parents say so?",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "I\u2019m also fifteen, so be my guest at not considering what I say, but...\n\nI appreciate your before last paragraph, where you consider what a lot of parents would forget here. Since this post is mainly about technology, right off the start I want to say, that \u201ca phone\u201d isn\u2019t a devil\u2019s device where the disturbing social media and porn lives. A phone (for you a tech savvy person OS or a platform) has a lot of \u201cplaces\u201d. It\u2019s where you learn, do schoolwork, chat with friends, play video games, check your reddit or instagram feed and yes, even look at (furry) porn. It seemed as you understand this, but I just wanted to make it clear for everyone.\n\nIt looks like there is more than one problem to this. The first, your son looks at disturbing things and you think that it might damage his future and mental health. Than, he goes to sleep too late. And mainly, he has problems that required a therapist in the first place, I\u2019m guessing a consequence of the divorce. \n\nAfter reading this two times, and let it be said from your perspective, the more rainbow-y one, I would feel many things in his position. \n\nStarting with the sleep problem, how late is he going to sleep? Because if it\u2019s at worst before midnight on quarantine days, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a problem, let alone requiring your intervention. \n\nIf it\u2019s something like 1, 2am everyday, no matter what he says I can guarantee you he knows he has a problem or at least has a voice telling him. Every other night he goes to sleep late again thinking how he disappointed you again and how you don\u2019t understand that he is trying and that you don\u2019t help him at all. All this thinking is making him sleep even later. He won\u2019t tell it to you, you would say your bullsh*t again and maybe yell at him. He sees you don\u2019t trust him to not go to sleep with all your router settings and spy apps, so what\u2019s the point of trying anyways? Maybe you are going to not trust him again when he tells you when he fell asleep or he\u2019s going to lie, because you are going to tell him the same unhelpful thing over an over.\n\nThat\u2019s what he is probably feeling, speaking from experience. What to do to help it? Give all the shit up and speak to him. Ask him when he wants to go to sleep, why he hasn\u2019t been doing that and trust in him that he can do it. And it\u2019s probably not gonna take one night, but someday, you are gonna see him putting that phone to charge in the living room at 11 voluntarily. You said it\u2019s an arms race. You should be at cold war with your son, you should be together.\n\nI don\u2019t know what he did to not have his phone, but the other parent was probably right to give one to him. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right to have a phone nowadays, but not having a phone especially now is social deprivation. \n\nNow, I will tell you how masturbating to porn works (I don\u2019t like to talk about this subject either, but if it\u2019s what it\u2019s gonna take). You open the stuff you like somewhere on a site, watch the thing, jerk off and close it, delete it from history and at the same time delete it from your life. What kinks you have only takes effect this time (I suppose he is not sexually active with a partner) and then never until the time comes up again. What I\u2019m trying to say (I know, not very comprehensively) is that essentially banning him from porn isn\u2019t the way to go, even if he watches whatever he does. I think it\u2019s not damaging and if he feels if is, he will try to get rid off it, but he should rather focus on accepting it. You said you feared that it would damage him, but when he is actively searching for it, even a teenage gangbang rape isn\u2019t gonna damage him. These porn blocks don\u2019t exist to punish/ annoy teenagers, but to protect actual kids, that don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing and find these things disgusting. You said that it was leaked the his siblings or something similar and that is an issue, that I believe can completely disappear after one talk. What you said about it hurting his carrier, I think is absolutely not true. How could someone ever search up what porn he watched ~10 years age and frankly who will ever care what you watched when you were a teen. And with the school laptop thing, he knows he crossed a line, but he only did it because you pushed him in to the corner and he wasn\u2019t thinking straight. Who would be thinking straight if they are at war with their own father. I think it\u2019s as much your fault as his.\n\nSo the bottom line? You are living (at least half the time) with a smart thinking person, he\u2019s not an extension of your consciousness anymore. You have to both make compromises and respect each other which isn\u2019t controlling his internet access nor leaking his sexual stuff to the house (as I understood that). And remember, you are the older one here and you should be the reasonable one and solve (not brute-force) issues.\n\nI\u2019ve seen here comments, saying that he is untrustworthy and abused the privilege. There is a bunch of people on this sub, who think that the sole purpose of being a teenager is to hate your parents and throw sticks between their legs or at least they completely lack empathy. They can\u2019t even look past surface behaviour and only use monkey logic. You could translate it to: Dog, I can\u2019t trust you to not jump the table when we eat, so you loose the privilege of left overs. But people really aren\u2019t animals, especially emotional teenagers and the problems almost always go past the surface logic.\n\nSince you haven\u2019t seen this yet, OP, one edit. Why did you make (written?) contracts with your son?\n\nFeel free to ask, answer or debate what I said.",

        "content": "Hi parenting community. I'm looking for much needed advice \n\nBACKGROUND\nI'm a teen father as you can see by the username. I met my sons mother when I was 16 and she became pregnant at 17. When she was pregnant she found out day one and I told her to get an abortion. She did not want to get one and insisted that we would not need to worry because she was commited to me and loved me and said she would work as i went to school but I thought it was bullshit because no way this young attractive teen was commited to me and I was raised by a single mother and had no hope for the future. After constantly asking her to get an abortion she kept telling me no and after a while I moved in with her. When I moved in she quit her job after she kept missing work. Due to her being pregnant I didnt care and told her it was fine. Throughout the pregnancy I constantly asked her is this what she wanted and she told me constantly yes and if she loved me and she said yes(I felt like the scared one and i wasn't pregnant lol) so things just continued and she seemed happy taking pictures and everything and we still had sex through the pregnancy so attraction was still there oddly even with her having a huge belly because I loved her a lot. I would work a lot while also going to college and hang out with her take her places but I didnt tell anyone and got angry when she did because I knew it wasnt right and our peers would hate us which they did but its not normal anyway. Other than that I supported her. Eventually our son was born and he was 9 pounds and 7 oz and was very pretty and it made me love him even more and he had very nice curls and everything and looked just like me and his mother. When he was born something in me changed and i loved her and him even more I couldnt even look at other women it was just about her and him and I really liked them but i told her if it got to overwhelming we could do adoption and she said okay. As the months went on she watched him while i went to work and school and I noticed she would just sit in bed all day And she was losing Huge amounts of weight she was 104 at 5'7 but she seemed to still watch him and want to watch movies with me but I was constantly scared and wondering if she was going to leave me and would ask but she constantly told me no. I noticed when her mom came to watch him when she wanted she would get happy but what parent doesn't so its okay and I would feel relief to but i still loved them both. She didn't really wanna have sex with me much but I always wanted to with her and (this time I was also responsible like my dumb ass should have been in the first place so I wouldn't have had a child)but she constantly rejected me but i got a little fat so I thought makes sense so after the months I lost weight and went from 179 to 158 to get reallly skinny because I know thats who she was attracted to initially....but It didn't work. After a while we broke up after she was texting someone else. And she went back home to her mom and I went to my own place.\n\nFAMILY\nI wanted to give a little quick background on my family and hers.\nHer mother is an alcoholic and she doesn't work but she was dating a guy who owned the house they all currently live in and pays nothing\n\n\nMy mom is mentally ill however and is a felon and was a single mom. In her early 20s because my father chose a different family so she is broke and lives paycheck to paycheck and my sister lives with her.\n\n\nPRESENT TIME\n\nI still love my son and see him every weekend. The mother says she spends her time hanging out with friends while I still go to school and live with a roommate right now. I tried to get back with her and told Her i love her and him but she says she doesn't want to take care of him and once abandoned him at my place and i lost my job. And she wants to do adoption and it doesn't seem like post partum because it seems as though she just wants to party and be wild and im losing hope because she is very cold hearted and doesn't give a fuck about me or our son that she wanted SOOO badly in the beginning and I've been trying to hold on but Even im leaning towards it and this is the first time in my life where i have felt suicidal and depressed because I just want my family to be together and it hurts she doesn't love me or care I was even talking to an agency and she told me she doesn't care who the family is but yet I've been looking and trying to make sure he is with someone that will love him and doesnt just treat him as a pet and plus he is a light skinned black child with curly hair so on one hand he won't be bullied badly because of skintone but on the other hand what are the odds even for black kids in adoption and i know i want to parent but im so fucking scared and don't want to struggle alone with him and we both suffer. He is 1 years old and now the mother wants nothing to do with him but I don't know what to do.\n\nFINANCES:\nCurrently im out of work but the mom makes 15 an hour working at amazon. And I have some capital. I dont want to disclose this but i do have 10,000 in the stock market half of it in the S&P 500 and I have 12'000 in savings and 10,000 in my checking so i have some money. The mother knows this and still doesnt care so her attitude isn't because im broke\n\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n I know you guys are parents yourself and would be able to give me the best advice needed.\n\nand sorry its my first post ever on reddit",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "You can take care of your son on your own. Adoption is a permanent solution to a temporary issue - and yours definitely seem temporary. You\u2019re scared and that\u2019s okay but you can be the child\u2019s primary caregiver. You can get help from public programs for food, insurance, etc. especially until you\u2019re back on your feet. You can do this - it\u2019ll just be hard and it\u2019ll be a lot of sacrifice and probably a lot of swallowing your pride to reach out for help. But there is help out there. And if she\u2019s working and doesn\u2019t want to take care of him - fine. She still is obligated to pay child support. I\u2019m talking from the perspective of a foster (and adoptive) parent, here. Keeping families together where they can be kept together is always the main goal. You love your son and he loves you and if you really went to parent and are otherwise capable beyond your currently unstable finances then don\u2019t let that issue make you give up your son forever.",

        "content": "I have 3 boys, my oldest is getting ready to turn 14. He has a \"girlfriend\" who is a family friend that lives his away so I don't have to worry about them getting into trouble. Yet. But I do think he needs to hear the sex talk, as I never got it and it would've made a big impact if it came from someone who cared. But it's not just about anatomy and abstinence and simple things like that, i need him to understand that women (especially ones his age) deserve respect in this field. I don't want him to err towards being a creeper just because I didn't cover all this. My husband (all the boys' dad) is an 80s baby and doesn't see the changes of today, he doesn't fully get that equality and kindness and fairness are absolute requirements, so I'm taking the reins in this talk. But I need to know what all I should cover. Thanks in advance for any guidance!",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "First of all, please discuss safe sex. Talk about condoms, other kinds of contraceptives, STDs, and so on.\n\nWhen it comes to the social aspects you have mentioned: Explain that consent is key. Both need to be comfortable with sex and happy to have it, otherwise your son can't. He should never pressure the girl into sex, and the girl should never pressure him into it. Talk about porn and how it can set up unrealistic expectations. It's not like real sex. \n\nTalk about how communication is important and both should talk about what they like and what they don't like. Not every girl is the same. Not everyone wants to be touched in the same way.\n\nI don't know how old your other boys are, but 14 is actually a bit on the late side when it comes to \"the talk\". If your other kids are a couple years younger, you can start talking about it already, as long as you talk about it in age-appropriate ways. Of course, if the others are like 4 and 2, please wait a little, but if they're pre-teens, go for it. An open communication basis is key, and if you talk about it before it's relevant, they will feel less awkward talking to you about this topic once it becomes relevant.",

        "title": "My son told us he was gay",
        "content": "This posting is a way for me to try to understand how I feel I\u2019m this. My 15 YO son was brave enough this tell me and his mother he was gay last night. This was not a surprise to me and my wife that he was so much as surprised that he articulated it out loud. I do not love him any differently and I am proud that he trusts us enough to be open. I also am not worried about him being gay. \n\nSo why has this been heavy on my heart for the last 12 hours? Here are some thoughts; \n\n1. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s gay, it\u2019s that he has come to an age where the idea of sexuality has started to emerge. If he would have sat down and wanted to talk about sex with a woman I would have felt just as uncomfortable for my 15 year old. Sexuality for a teen is a rocky road at best and as a parent I don\u2019t want to think about my kids desiring sex. \n\n2. We live in a firmly right leaning conservative town (not city) in the center of the Bible Belt. I worry about how this community will treat him. I stand up for and defend him, but I can\u2019t fix a bad day where his classmates decide to pick on him for being something that they don\u2019t understand. I worry about the hurt he will experience. Further, when he turns 18 and can move out of this town, I worry that I will rarely see my son because he doesn\u2019t want to come back. (Not because if us but because of the citizens).\n\n3. Relationship advice now feels a little more daunting. To be honest, the dynamics of a gay relationship introduce factors that I cannot connect with and I worry that my son will reject my advice by saying \u201cyou don\u2019t understand.\u201d This will cause hurt for me. \n\n4. What the hell am I going to do about my racists and bigoted in-laws. I think my side of the family will be just fine, but I might have to slap my FIL upside his head if he insults my son. \n\n5. Will he have kids? Will he get married? Am I clinging onto ideas of \u201cnormal\u201d that aren\u2019t practical anymore? This is a journey for me as a parent to navigate what adult life for him will look like. \n\n6. Let me just say this out loud: did I do something wrong? Again, I don\u2019t care that he is gay and I will continue to teach him to be confident in who he is and what he loves. But will there be a day where he says \u201cif you had taken me camping or been tougher on me I wouldn\u2019t be this way.\u201d I strongly believe that people largely don\u2019t choose to be gay, but I don\u2019t want my son to blame me if he feels conflicted about his sexuality. \n\nThere are a lot of emotions here. Mostly to see my son grow into a man. Would love to hear how others have felt and moved ahead in life.",

Of course you did nothing \"wrong\". You can't discipline, re-dress, re-diect,  camp, sport or train the gay out of someone. Being supportive of your child has meant that at 15, he TRUSTS you.

        "content": "I really need help with this. My older son is almost 13 now and I've had issues with his phone usage. It's been hard to manage overall since my wife is a phone addict herself. I've had problems with his online activities for over a year now and I have done what most teens don't want: I unlocked his phone, reviewed his apps, browsing history, and chats.\n\nI get the lure of porn at his age but I have an issue with him accessing it, especially feeling like giving him a phone is the primary way he is doing it. He's also having conversations that involve sex. Fortunately he has not been sexting and it's been all talk so far.\n\nHowever I am very concerned and I really want to go the route of taking away the phone, because I don't believe he can self-moderate at his age. This will be perceived as heavy-handed, including by my wife. I have not shared with her what I found, mainly since she tends not to take parenting as seriously as I do. \n\nAny parents have similar experiences? I know it's not going to go smoothly at all, but I would love to know how to do this without totally alienating my son.",

One time he wanted to know how he pees, and it ended up with us doing a science experiment with old coffee grounds and a coffee filter simulating the glomerulus and nephron of the kidneys. Kids sharp, hope he does well with his brain one day.\n\nLast week I was on my period. Son was in my room, sitting on my bed reading about transformers. I mumble under my breath, \"I need another tampon.\" And like a fuckin' bat with sonar he picks it up. He asks what a tampon is, and very carefully I tell him that I and other people can bleed once a month or so. He looked concerned and asked if I was okay, and why do I bleed. Obviously I'm not about to have the sex talk with my child, so I tell him he is too young but when he gets older I promise I will tell him why.

        "most_upvoted_comment": "It sounds like your daughter really trusts you, to be telling you so many of the things that bother her and confides in you. She is hardly a child anymore, and will be considered an adult within a year, so you have to think of your long term relationship with her over your short term fears of her being in this environment that she may be uncomfortable in but not so uncomfortable that she wants to leave. \n\nCPS isn\u2019t going to bust down the door because consenting adults are having sex in a house with a teenager, or that they\u2019re getting drunk at home, or for allowing a 17 year old to have her boyfriend over. \n\nIf your daughter was so upset by this stuff that she wanted to leave, then she can leave and be with you. Court ordered visitation isn\u2019t treated the same way for older teens than it is for small children. You can reassure her that you are there for her any time night or day if things get too uncomfortable for her and she feels like she\u2019s in danger or just doesn\u2019t want to stay there anymore. I would encourage you to empower her to make these choices for herself rather than having you swoop in and declaring these choices for her.",

Fortunately, her mother and I have a fairly good parenting relationship or this situation would be even more challenging to deal with.\n\nIt all started approximately one year ago, our daughter sneaked out of her mom's house and stole her car. She then proceeded to pick up several other teens for a late night joy ride that included drinking and drugs. The cops noticed the odd driving patterns of the vehicle and pulled them over. She was arrested and received a six month probation term. Up until this point we were very trusting of her but we were forced to do some investigating and it revealed that drugs, alcohol and unprotected sex had been ongoing for sometime. As a result we were forced to take very restrictive measures, seek out counseling for her and help ensure she completed her probation successfully.\n\nOver the course of the last year she had completed all her requirements and had made great strides in earning our trust back. We moved forward with trusting her and giving her back those privileges that she had lost. Sadly, we recently noticed some inconsistencies in her behavior and decided to do some investigating. We found out that she's been engaging in similar destructive behavior once again (alcohol, drugs, unprotected sex, distributing nude photos, etc...). We are back to square one after an entire year of this process. I feel very gullible and deceived by all of this. It's also very disheartening that her biggest concern is her loss of access to phone, friends, etc... with no concern for the people she's hurt or her own health and well being. After reviewing the content on her phone I found that she seems to have this infatuation with the gangster lifestyle that is often depicted in rap/hip-hop culture and so she is trying to emulate that lifestyle.\n\nI am unsure of how I should handle this situation going forward. I feel like I let her down and the past year of progress was just washed away. I love my daughter but I do not like the person that she currently is.

At the end of the day I want to protect him, make sure he's happy, supported.\n\nI know its 2020 and all that, but he's still a boy who doesn't play football, not your classic guys guy, and while he isn't obviously outwardly gay either, I still worry he might be an easy target for older guys.\n\nI was the second oldest in my family, but my older brother was pretty much not there as support so I grew a thick skin myself, \n\nI also was more of a jock from an early age, got on the football team so that meant I was never bullied or scared, but thats not my sons path, so yup, I'm just a worried dad. \n\nIf there are any gay parents on here, or parents with gay kids, can you offer me any advice?",

        "content": "I am the mom of 3 girls who live with their dad and his partner in a big house in a great area. I live in the same city but in a small apartment in an area where the schools are not as good. The girls have always lived with their dad ever since we separated 3 years ago. Before that we all lived in the house together.\n\nRight after the divorce there were some disagreements between me and their dad, but those are forgotten now and we get along just fine with each other. His new partner is kind to the girls and the girls excel in school. Of course I miss them a lot, but I see them on a weekly basis and once a month they come over for a full weekend at my apartment. I feel very close to all 3 of them.\n\nSo to the reason I'm writing. My oldest daughter who is 13 is a year ahead in school which means she is in her freshman year of high school. She's in a gifted program and also in the math club and in the chess club. A few months ago she made friends with a guy who is 16 at a chess meet. They started chatting and playing chess online, but as of recently they have started going over to each others houses. This weekend she asked if he could join us at my apartment and I said of course. I was really happy that she asked because unlike the other 2 kids, my oldest daughter almost never brings anyone over and has difficulties relating to other kids, despite being well-liked among her classmates.\n\nSo while he was over I couldn't help but notice that they seemed very comfortable touching each other. They spooned under a blanket while we were watching a movie and my daughter sat in his lap for a few minutes during breakfast. He also did her hair-do in the morning. I decided to call up their dad to discuss their friendship. Their dad had already noticed the same things and had 'a talk' with my daughter about birds and bees (not the first one but perhaps the most concrete one).  Apparently he told her that if she is mature enough to have sex, then she is mature enough to pay for it. He won't be paying for any form of birth control or condoms, because it is his firm belief that no one should be having sex unless they are able to pay for their own protection. I offered to pay for the birth control or condoms, but he asked me not to, because she needs to learn that with sex comes responsibility. I tried to reason with him that we don't want to risk a pregnancy, but he told me to have a little more faith in my daughter, saying she won't have sex without protection just because we aren't paying for it, she's already started tutoring some other kids to save up some money. \n\nI decided to talk to my daughter about all of this. She said she is fine with the way her dad is handling it and that it makes sense that she covers her expenses if she wants to have sex. I tried to find out a bit more on how close they are to actually having sex, but I didn't get many answers on that front. She told me not to worry because she is making some money and they have a plan should it come to sex. When she saw that I looked worried anyway she assured me again she won't have sex without protection. I know she always keeps her promises, but she hasn't felt how powerful the force of teen love is yet. \n\nI guess I have 3 options:\n\n1. Leave it up to her to buy her own birth control or condoms\n2. Tell her dad that I will be providing birth control or condoms despite what he thinks\n3. Give her birth control and condoms without letting her dad know\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhich one would you do? Has anyone been in a similar situation? What do you make of her dads attitude towards it?",

        "content": "Over the Christmas holidays we moved to another state. Back at my 13 year old son's old school, he had a solid group of responsible, mature, good-influence friends. However, now that we've moved away and he's started at a new school, his new friend group is less than spectacular. I especially dislike the ringleader of this group, a rebellious 14 year old. The blatant disrespect and lack of discipline in this teen is obvious. He is one of those stereotypical punk skateboarder teens. He swears like a sailor, is ill-mannered, doesn't place school as a top priority, and promotes negative views about sex and girls that our family disapproves of. This teen's values obviously don't line up with our values that we want our son to uphold. I've been thinking about talking to my son about this, but obviously, he's growing up and he's still going to see him at school. Is intervention necessary, or is this just something that I should stay out of?",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "I had some friends who I'm sure my parents thought were a bad influence.  The reason I wanted friends who didn't place school as a top priority is that I felt like how I was doing in school was all that my parents cared about.  It was important for me to have friends who liked me for something other than how I was doing in school.  Maybe your son is looking for something like this by being friends with this kid.\n\nOr it could be that the good-influence people are not letting your son into their friend group.  Kids who look like they're well-behaved and mature aren't always what they seem.  They're not always kind to people who aren't successful (according to their definition of success) or who don't fit in.  I generally was friends with the misfits at school, because the more popular kids didn't want anything to do with me, or outright harassed me.  \n\nI have high functioning autism, and have trouble fitting in socially.  This got worse around age 12 or 13- the social rules for kids change then.  I had been able to sort of fake it to get along as a kid, but the teenage social standards were more than I could figure out.",

I've figured she's just a teenager being a teenager and haven't thought much of it beyond the usual issues like curfew and talking to her about sex. She assured me she wasn't going to have sex with boys.\n\nI found out just what she meant by that last night. I'd expected to be out of town for a couple of days for work (Jill has a key to the apartment), but plans were changed at the last second and I came home late at night. Because I was stupid, my phone was dead and I'd forgotten the car charger so I couldn't call ahead.\n\nSuffice it to say, my daughter was having sex with a friend of hers from the swim team and had left the bedroom door open and things are now extremely awkward between us.\n\nI have basically no experience with LGBT issues, but I've told her that I love her unconditionally and that I don't mind if she brings her girlfriend over as long as they lock the door (I don't really want to encourage her to be having sex, but I figure teenagers are gonna teenager and might as well give them a safe place to do it). Jill just said \"Thanks\" and has been avoiding speaking to me.\n\nI can't say Jill being into girls surprises me, it makes a number of things ever since she was little suddenly make sense, but I'm not sure if \"Relax, I've suspected you were gay since you were little\" would be the best approach.\n\nAnyone who has experience with this, as a parent or the teen, do you have any advice about what I can do to be a supportive parent to Jill?\n\ntldr: single mom came home to teenage daughter having sex with another girl, things now super awkward, how do I be a supportive parent to her?",

        "content": "My daughter just turned 14 a couple weeks ago. I have always been very involved in what she does online, and check her phone and computer regularly. I recently allowed her to get discord to talk to her friends from school and keep in touch as we just moved.\n\nRecently she got into some pretty cringey role play on some minecraft servers and has since added those people to her discord and has been keeping in touch with them. I was a teen once too, so I left the cringey role play thing alone as it didn't seem sexual.\n\nToday I checked through her history and a guy previously named \"hentai lover\" (I commented on the inappropriate name but didn't check into their chat that day) has changed his name to something more innocuous. There is a ton of texting back and forth, she is lying about her home life (expected teen attention stuff) and amplifing her problems (also expected, yay attention). She has told this guy she is 17. There is sexual flirting.\n\nShe has been pouring her heart out to him as if she has no support at home, and the guy, admittedly, has responded very kindly.\n\nHowever, there are references to him thinking her very innocent and obviously a virgin, and how she is into such dirty role play. She is not allowed internet connected devices in her room, the chat from a couple nights ago shows her talking about how she was sneaking the phone into her room and talking to him at 11 pm.\n\nI just... I have no barometer or mom friends with kids this age to ask. She is clearly exploring her sexuality and relationships, but I feel like its way too early for this kind of heavy shit. She is lying about her age! My first instinct is to remove all devices, ban discord, and re-enable the monitoring software.\n\nI was once a teen. I did a lot of this same stuff, so ... at what point do I back off and leave her to it? At what point do I allow her to have unrestricted access to devices? Should I message this guy and let him know she's only just turned 14? How can I support her without going nuclear?\n\nHelp.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: We don't allow devices in her room. She snuck it in after we had gone to bed and had told the guy as much. After much ruminating and internal freaking out we had another talk about internet safety. About what I found, etc. \n\nHentaiLover is an older teen or young adult. They have video chatted, but have not sent any sexy photos. I explained that those could land her and him in jail. I told her I expected her to have a talk with him very soon and let him know that she lied about her age. She offered to \"set the record straight\" with her friends about some of the attention seeking parent hating lies she told. (We don't listen to her, no one knows she has Autism not even us, etc.) She has aspergers. We talk often about sex, boys, the internet, life, etc.\n\nI told her she didn't need to do that, that I remember being a young teen and lying for attention. That it wasn't healthy but I wouldn't embarrass her by making her come clean because I don't need her teen friend's approval.\n\nFor now, all devices are coming to our room to be charged when we go to bed. I told her that I dont mind so much the sexual role play, but the other stuff like lying about her age and video chatting were crossing a line, and that we needed to make sure she was safe first and foremost. \n\nI told her I would continue to check her chats and that she was not to delete anything else (she had deleted the sexual role play bits from her conversation) or I would be forced to remove discord alltogether and reinstate the monitoring software.\n\nThank you everyone for your thoughts. I dont have any mum friends to go to with this stuff, and I'm out of my depth!",

        "content": "Just a fair warning, this will be long. I apologize if I didn\u2019t really explain all that well and it may be confusing) \nAdvice needed please. This is a tough one for me to talk about. I feel like a failure as a parent. A bit of background- \n\nMy husband and I have been married for 19 years. We have 2 girls, ages 23 and 17, and 2 boys, ages 13 and 15. Husband is military and has been for over 20 years now. \n\nThe issue we\u2019re having is with our 15 year old son. We have caught him sneaking out twice now. He\u2019s gone over to a girls house about \u00be mile away and sneaking into her window where they have decided to have sex. \n\nThe first time he was caught was in Dec. (our oldest is living in another state for college) We had plane tickets to go spend Christmas with family. My mother passed last year and we wanted to be together to get through this first big holiday without her. My kids were very close to her and her death was very unexpected. \n\nAnyway, we had tickets to leave the 18th very early. Our ride to the airport was coming at 4:00 am. My husband and I had stayed up all night packing and getting things in order. At 3:30 we went to gather the kids and notice the 15 year old gone. My husband tracks his phone, sees approx where he is and calls him. He of course tries to lie but quickly learns that\u2019s not going to work. I\u2019m having a panic attack thinking something terrible happened to him. \n\nHe walks in and his phone is taken from him and we get to the airport. He knows he\u2019s in trouble. \nThe next day I sat down with him and we had a heart to heart talk. I had my oldest daughter when I was 18. My younger 3 never knew as my husband legally adopted her when she was young. He\u2019s her dad and no one would ever know unless told. I told him of my experience growing up and going down the path he seems to want to go on. (My 17 year old was told when she was about 16) We had what I thought was a pivotal moment in our relationship. Let him know I understand more than he thinks. It was good. \n\nFast forward to us getting home on the 6th of this month. He has his phone back. (Stupid of us) I wake up at about 1:30 that morning with a bad feeling. Go check on the kids to find him missing. Again. His phone goes right to voicemail. Can\u2019t trace it. We know the neighborhood he\u2019s in. So, my husband and I go driving around that neighborhood in seperate cars (looking creepy I\u2019m sure) trying to spot him. We don\u2019t know where this girl lives. (She has a boyfriend BTW. And, I have already had my daughter tell her to leave my son alone. He doesn\u2019t need to be in her mess) Was about to give up when I see him trying to quietly close a window on this house. \n\nI park and he practically craps himself. He knows he\u2019s in deep trouble. I march up to the door and proceed to wake this girls mom up. Her Dad is currently in another country. (We live on Military post) She is upset and says this isn\u2019t the only boy that\u2019s been caught crawling into her window. Her mother is embarrassed and apologetic. I lecture (yell) at both teens as I feel it\u2019s both their faults. We trade phone numbers in case we need to communicate. They are both told to never speak or contact each other ever again, I\u2019m mortified that my son would think it\u2019s okay to sneak into a girls room and have sex with her. That\u2019s so cowardly. I\u2019m not raising my children to act this way. \n\nAnyway, we\u2019re putting him into counseling and have taken his phone and pretty much all of anything away. \nI need advice and just thoughts as what to do from here and if I\u2019m doing something wrong. \nWe try to be open about things and the counseling is just in case he has something he\u2019s not comfortable telling his Dad or I. \nMy husband leaves next month for the whole month and I don\u2019t want to have to sleep with my eyes open. Lead me in the right direction please!\n\nWe have not shamed him. Have only let him know how disappointed we are and angry for lying and being a sneaky little ass. Our girls tried to lie and be sneaky once or twice but not like this. And it didn\u2019t last long. They learned quick that mom and dad aren\u2019t dumb., \nNeedless to say he no longer has privileges of his phone PlayStation Kindle\u2019s iPod iPad whatever else is in this house.

I was just so focused on seeing the girl I liked, and I wasn't even getting any sex! It wasn't till I was a parent that I saw how serious it was and realized how much I must have worried them. \n\nIt sounds like you are doing the right things. I'd just add that you should be clear - while it is normal to be interested in sex it is unacceptable to sneak around and be disrespectful to all parents involved and possibly put himself in danger walking the neighborhood late night when no one expects him to be. At a basic but perhaps humorous level, if he is not mature enough to have sex at a time and place when he is not even free to use a door to get in and out of the room he's not mature enough to be having sex\n\nI'd try to get him interested in some new activities, and meeting some different girls. A lot of what he is doing is normal, but that doesn't mean he should be redirected or that his actions couldn't have serious consequences. Also no phones and computers at all at night. All locked up in your room. Ideally that girls mom needs some window alarms, but that's out of your control. She REALLY shouldn't have different guys coming in at night. Something is up over there that they need to deal with. I'm glad you did address it with that mom.  \n\nAlso make sure he knows about condoms, birth control, the morning after pill. If he is going to have sex he best be sure he is fully informed about how to keep from getting anyone pregnant.",

School just got started back up; she's in her junior year with really good grades so far, and she's also in an EMT explorers program, so I'll give her that.. I don't suspect she's using drugs and she she hasn't seemed depressed, so whats left, other than sex? Her and I were the only two awake, so I decided to hit the heavy topics while she was in a decent mood and her younger sisters weren't around to hear or interrupt. I started with asking if she felt depressed. She said other than a little stress, she's ok. (Both my 13F and I are in individual therapy and we all go to a family session once a month, so she knows she has resources.) I then asked about any drugs, including nicotine and alcohol. She denied any usage, while making a face that made me believe that was the most ridiculous question. She's never been a good liar, so I do trust her. On to the next topic, sex.. I bluntly asked if she was having sex. She said no; she's not ready yet. I explained that I am not naive, she is human and I know it will happen eventually. So when it does, she needs to be smart about it. I told her most teen pregnancies happen because nobody wants to talk to their parents about it, so here I am. I promised not to flip out or treat her like crap, but for her to let me know so I can make her an appointment before she does anything, in order to get her a gynecologist, birth control, condoms, whatever she needs to be safe and smart. I had a pretty decent relationship with my mom but still didn't tell her I was having sex because I didn't want to disappoint her, then ended up having a kid at 18. So, I told my kid while I (and probably every other parent in history) won't ever be ready for her to have sex, I will support her in every way that I can. She then leaned in for a long hug.\n\n\nEdit: Apparently I should've added more context. I didn't automatically assume that she's tired because she's having sex. That's absurd. I pay attention. There's been a few changes in her. I thought to myself, \"It's probably nothing, but there's a chance something is going on so I should have a conversation with her. Now that she's getting a little older, I should remind her that she can come to me with anything, and I'll be a little more specific when we talk.\" \n\nThanks for all of the positive reinforcement, it's greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you generous stranger for the gold!

        "content": "My son is 14. He is a smart, funny kid. However, he does have a few issues. They are as follows:\n\n* He has a hard time talking to strangers. For example, he doesn't look at people in the eye when they talk to him, nor does he want to have social interactions with other kids. This isn't just introversion, it is way more severe. It's at the point where, for example, if someone says hi to him or tries to talk to him, he will try to run away. He has ALWAYS been like this since he was 4. It's at the point where people who haven't known him for a while think he has some sort of disability (he doesn't, he was tested). However, he doesn't have this problem with me and his dad. We are going to pursue therapy for this, but I'm also open to non-therapeutic suggestions.\n* He lies about when he is doing his homework. For example, he will go to his room to do homework, but I will instead find him playing video games when he is supposed to be working. The only thing that works is to make him do his homework under our supervision. He says he enjoys school, and when he works hard, he sure does well. To stop this, we just gave him a computer without wifi and told him \"If you want to waste time on video games, go ahead, but you'll be in trouble\". So far, it's been working because he doesn't want to be in trouble and have low grades!\n\nOut of all this, what I am wondering most is if he is a troubled teen. I'm not asking for an internet diagnosis, I'm just wondering if these things I said above are signs of trouble ahead. He hasn't rebelled with respect to his clothes or fashion, and isn't blatantly wearing things we disapprove of. He also hasn't experimented with drugs, sex, or alcohol (I know he's honest about this, I would know if he was doing those things) nor has he skipped school. Thoughts?",

        "content": "My kids are 4.5 and 2. My husband is a man-child. He's not as bad as some of the man-children I read about on this sub (and others). He holds a good job, he loves and is engaged with our kids. He doesn't sit on his ass and play video games all day/night. He's a \"good man\" on the surface. He has no nefarious intentions, that's for damn sure.\n\nHowever, he has inattentive type ADHD and EXTREME follow-through problems. The ADHD was only diagnosed earlier this year. They're still \"trying\" to find the right medication for him. I say \"trying\" because our couples counselor recommended he find a different prescriber due to various red-flags with his current one and he's made no effort to do so. There are so many times in my day that I wish I could just shake him and scream JUST FUCKING DO IT into his face (regarding the psych and pretty much everything).\n\n.. which gets back to my gigantic frustration in this relationship and family dynamic. He shows no initiative in anything. If I don't tell him to do something, it doesn't get done. If I don't do it myself, it doesn't get done. If I don't put it on our shared calendars (one hard copy and one digital because maybe one will work for him?!) that I created, it won't get on there. If I don't research something about our children's complicated medical conditions (congenital heart defect, HIE), it won't get followed up on. He doesn't know the name of our child's cardiologist, let alone make a damn appointment himself. He doesn't even know the name of our child's neurologist, let alone make the damn appointment himself. I do all of the doctors' appointments. I do all of the physical and occupational therapy appointments. I do all of the paperwork and appointments with early intervention.\n\nI do all of the meetings with the school. He let down our 4.5 year old by not going to any of the parent events this past year. I did them all.\n\nI book nearly all of the couples' counseling appointments. The counselor asks him to book and we've both waited 2+ weeks on his stupid ass to actually do anything-- and he doesn't. The lack fo initiative he shows is akin to someone who is purposefully avoiding responsibilities but the counselor and I both do not think he's doing that.. he's just extremely daft, somehow. It is TRULY baffling.\n\nHe has major issues with age-appropriate discipline and limits/consequences. I held myself over with \"Maybe he's better with older kids\" for the last couple years but the more I think about it, the more I realize the parenting problems he showcases will not lend themselves well to late childhood/early teen years. Our 4.5 year old rebels against him constantly already. Even our sweet, gentle soul 2 year old is beginning to do the same.\n\nI do all of the financial planning. I do all of the major decision making. When I ask his input on something, like a partnership, he states the extreme obvious. For example, I asked him if he thought we should list the house and move. His answer was, \"Well, this house is really far away from the kids' school.\" REALLY. NO SHIT, SHERLOCK.\n\nHIs communication is shit. He gets laser focused on a single task and then can't get it done because he has to take care of the kids. For example, he told me he has no time to mow the lawn. Well, you would have time to mow the lawn if you told me the day/time you wanted to do it and I could get my work schedule around that. Instead, you're silent and now the grass is a foot long. Or do I need to manage that, as well.\n\nI am aware of the \"emotional labor\" thing-- I do all of it and I know I do it all. I tried to set him up for success in becoming an equal partner-- encouraging him to get on medication, treatment, etc. I tried to back off to let him pick up the slack. \"Women do too much.\" Well, ok, let me not do it then. For 6 months, the house fell into disrepair.\n\nAll our couples counselor says is, essentially, that we should stay together for the kids at this point but he's not one to tell me when enough is enough, only I know that. I am dedicated to this couples counselor, he really knows his shit and has been doing it for over 30 years. Well, I'm hitting my wall. What's too much tension and shit emotional development for a child? I can't imagine that this is really any healthier than separating. They have no model for a good relationship-- not even close.\n\nI am fed the fuck up with being the only adult in this family. Our marriage has been shit/nonexistent for nearly 3 years now. We haven't had sex since our 2 year old was conceived. We haven't even kissed. I find myself actively hating and/or being disgusted him and his behavior (lack of action and communication) on a near daily basis and the kids can clearly pick up on such a tense emotional atmosphere. Our 4.5 year old even tells me twice or so a week, \"We should go to a different house and leave daddy at this house.\"\n\nThe only saving grace is that we're rarely near each other and work opposite shifts to cut down on child care expenses so they don't have to witness the in-room tension very often. However, it is still too often and I have little hope for this marriage. He says he's trying but I can't see how. I feel like I should be a single mom so at least I don't even have that flicker of hope that someone will meet me halfway on stuff.\n\ntl;dr husband is strange man-child, I do nearly everything; how much longer should I try to keep this together; I feel like I'm dragging him along in our lives",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "So, I have a unique perspective on this, because I have inattentive ADHD, I was diagnosed at age 10.\n\nFirst off, I COMPLETELY understand why you\u2019re frustrated. The thing is, he probably really is trying. I know that it doesn\u2019t appear that way to you, and I understand why, but the fact that he has lived with undiagnosed ADHD and has held a stable job is actually pretty impressive. The problem is, he likely uses a lot of energy and focus to function at work, and when he gets home, there\u2019s none left, which isn\u2019t fair to you.\n\nSecondly, if possible, I would try to wait it out until he finds the right medication. I feel like freakin superwoman when I\u2019ve taken my meds. I\u2019m motivated, and I actually get things done around the house. When I\u2019m not medicated, doing the dishes is almost painful and I have to exert a lot of energy forcing myself to do it. It\u2019s not great, and I hate myself when I\u2019m not on meds. Most of the issues you\u2019ve posed here are related to his ADHD symptoms, and I really think that if he found the right medication, you\u2019d see some very drastic improvement in a very short amount of time. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d tell him that if he doesn\u2019t book an appoint within the next week, you\u2019re leaving. I don\u2019t normally recommend ultimatums in marriage, but a lot of ADHD people NEED some sort of external pressure in order to get things done, because we lack the motivation to do it for ourselves. But, also don\u2019t be surprised if he doesn\u2019t book the Appt until the last possible day because if there\u2019s anything we do well, it\u2019s procrastination.\n\nLastly, I am really sorry you\u2019re going through this. I hate dealing with my ADHD symptoms, I can only imagine how much more frustrating it is for others. Please understand that I only recommended waiting to see how things are when he\u2019s on the right medication because it seemed like part of you wanted to save your marriage. If you\u2019re truly done and you decide to leave, I understand. I wish you the best of luck either way!",

        "content": "**tldr:** 15F living through a divorce between her mom and stepfather of 10 years seems to be engaging in irresponsible behavior. Her mom is unable to keep an eye on her yet will freak out at the thought of my daughter moving to live with me. Recommendations on how to proceed?\n\n\\------------\n\nThere's a lot to unpack here, so please bear with me as I set the stage. I am a 40M.\n\nMy daughter's mother (38F, \"M\") and I split amicably when my daughter was about 4 years old. We just went in different life directions and I moved across the country. M subsequently met Stepdad (38M, \"SD\") and they've been married for the last 10 years, having another child together. Their marriage started falling apart about a year ago and it's been messy. They are now going through a messy divorce, with M working multiple jobs (not home much) to replace SD's income and pay for legal assistance. I have remained impartial through all of this. SD sent me a message a few months ago, requesting a phone call. I did not reply as there was no reason I could think of that we needed to talk, and I happened to know that M and SD had gotten in to an argument that day.\n\nFast forward to this summer - my daughter (15F, \"Z\") has been with me for the summer and has been learning how to drive. We are preparing for a road-trip across the country where I will be leaving her with M and a new car. A few days ago, I get a message from SD stating \"You need to have Z drug tested. She's been doing drugs and M knows about it.\" I pressed him for more information and he sends over a flood of chat screenshots from several months ago between Z and various friends. I asked him how he got them, and it turns out that Z had logged in to his computer and forgot to log out.\n\nMoving beyond that fact that SD never provided this information to M (although now I know that's why he had attempted to reach out a few months ago...), I want to set the stage with a couple more items: for the most part, M and I are \"sex positive parents\", and believe that our kids should have some room to grow up/make mistakes/explore life with appropriate boundaries. We'd rather be able to have open conversations about things and the conversations have been had around coming to us if she needs protection. Additionally, M has created an environment at home where occasional, responsible marijuana use is acceptable (I'm mostly okay with this) as long as it doesn't leave the house. To our knowledge, Z is a virgin. With all that out of the way...\n\nThe contents of the messages contain the following content:\n\n* Sexts between her and her boyfriend alluding to acts that have already occurred\n* Messages bragging that she tricked someone in to driving her to a \"dick appointment\"\n* Messages discussing cocaine usage, and that she snorted her antidepressant medication, and bragging about how she smokes several times a day\n* Messages between her and someone setting up an arrangement to buy weed and vape cartridges\n* Hurtful commentary related to M\n\nAll that said, my daughter is a highly intelligent, articulate kid who also unfortunately inherited ADHD and depression (and she is taking prescribed medications for each), and in general seems to crave attention and validation. I believe that while a lot of what she wrote was exaggeration, I also believe a lot of it is based on real events.\n\nM is devastated and wanted me to immediately ground her and take away all electronics. I am the logical one and have refused to react until we've had a few days to discuss our next steps, especially since Z is with me for a few more weeks, doesn't know anyone locally and doesn't leave the house. M is very emotionally reactive and during our last conversation, immediately jumped to \"Please don't take Z away from me.\" - which wasn't even part of the conversation. Every time we've had a conversation about Z potentially moving across the country to be with me for a year or two, it has gone extremely poorly.\n\nI am here to seek some impartial advice on the situation as a whole. What I feel like I'd like to do is the following:\n\n1. I want to sit down with Z with a printout of all the screenshots and ask her to explain every bit of it, followed by a conversation that she will NOT be getting a car until she demonstrates some maturity and responsibility. I do believe that teens deserve privacy and the ability to be themselves with their friends, so I am struggling on how to balance her privacy and freedom vs verifying that her behavior has improved.\n2. I want to try and convince M to allow Z to stay with me for this school year so that I can put her in therapy and allow M to have fewer responsibilities while she gets her affairs in order. This is going to be a very difficult conversation because this would mean both I AND SD are keeping our respective kids somewhat away from her. I'm hoping to soften this by agreeing to fly Z out to visit her one weekend a month. Alternatively, Z can go back with the agreement that M has to make it a priority to take and keep Z in therapy, but if I feel it is not working that Z will move with me. (We have no legal arrangement since our split was amicable.) I feel this would be best as I earn a significant income, have a regular 9-5 job, and can be there for my daughter (and keep an eye on her).\n\nI'm looking forward to any advice you may have, as well as any other subreddits that this post may be more appropriate for.",

The teens each had 1 roommate who was the same gender, and the orchestra didn't really supervise the teens, since they the town was small and safe.

Well I guess my doctor didn't inform me properly and you're actually suppose to wait a month and I guess 7 days only count before/after(?) your period. Now i'm here, crying while typing out this email. I'm so frustrated as I took precaution but that I should've looked more into things rather than put trust in what my doctor said or maybe my body is just foolish 9% that fail.\u00a0\n\nI didn't realize I was pregnant earlier because with the Birth\u00a0Control i'm taking, I was informed that I wouldn't have a period, the most would be spotting. so when i spotted, i thought it was okay. I only really realize, \"OH SHI\" because I notice my stomach was starting to feel bloated/hard and never went down. even looking in the mirror i noticed a new bulge. Like everything of me is the same except for my stomach. also a lot of the symptoms with birth control surprisingly matched with pregnancy symptoms so when I started to feel sick, i thought it was because of the pill. I started googling about this and even made a post about this weird thing i'm experiencing in this girl talk app I use and that when someone comment that I should take a test just in case and sad boom, i learn that i'm pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI don't know how to tell anyone and just truly terrified. I'm scared to tell my parents because of disappointing them and truly terrified to tell my boyfriend. I know that if I tell my parents they'll be there for me but with my boyfriend, who knows. I believe things will be okay but at the same time, who knows and that scares me. My boyfriend and I relationship is very loving and I feel extremely safe with him, we're very open with each other. it just we're both in uni and he's graduating this May and he's so excited about it but now I feel like the bummer here with this situation. im terrified as how will he react because he been planning things out for when he graduate and all this things and now here's me. I know this is a both of us thing . He has mention that if he was to every have a kid unexpectedly he would do whatever, but that's talk not action.we had talked about wanting kids but obviously way later in life, not now.\n\nI thought of abortion so I don't have to tell anyone but the thought of going through something like that and holding onto the guilt is horrifying/depressing. I believe in pro-choice but i don't think I can go through such thing. Also I feel like 3 months is kind of far for abortions. I was really thinking of going through this as I even bought an abortion pill over the internet but later learn that I can't take it as the latest to take it is 9 weeks. I could take it but the site informed me that I should take it in the ER bathroom because most likely complications will occur, no thanks (it was shipped from Australia to India which I thought was sketch but at the time, i thought \"gotta do what I gotta do\". Such a sad thing to do/think but I was scared. My options were running low.\u00a0\n\nThis has all kept me up at night that I cry myself to sleep or just cry when I overthink of the situation. I feel so stuck and just lost\n\nObviously I have to tell my parents/him but i'm just terrified. If you can please give advice on this or at least help brighten things. I know being able to have a child is a god blessing and I should be happy that my body is capable of producing life but i'm not sure if i'm ready.\u00a0\n\nfrom a parent perspective or maybe if you were in my same feet, please help :(\n\nside note: I do know that if I have a child, I will be able to care for it as my mom made me watch my siblings growing up like change there diaper, feeding, cleaning, and such since I was 11 ( I have 4 siblings that I helped raised) . So i'm not worried about like \"oh I don't know how to watch a kid\" but rather, am I mentally ready and questioning if i'm really capable.\n\nI also know 21 is old enough and no longer a kid/teen but still, having a child wasn't a plan and I dont know what to do other than to feel shame/guilt for everything\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*I post this in the relationship catagory too but want to post here to get actual parents help :(",

        "content": "Our 16 year old son (only child) is fiercely independent. He likes to be alone as much as  possible. He's not depressed. He's not going through anything. It's just  who he is. It's who he has always been (couldn't even get him excited for Chuck E Cheese when he was little. He loves home.). He stays home when we go out  most of the time, he prefers it that way. He doesn't spend his time  sleeping or playing video games, he plays instruments and works on  schoolwork.I am like this as well. If I do not have enough time alone, I get very anxious and overwhelmed. I value my time with my pets, crafts,  chick flicks, shopping and snacks. I love long drives alone. I like to  vacation alone. I truly enjoy me time more than I enjoy being around  people.As a child, I spent a LOT of time alone. I was often  grounded (months on end) to my room with no phone or tv, allowed out for  meals and to use the bathroom. I learned to love books and knew the  words to every song on the radio. However, when the holidays came and  people were around, I'd find myself making a plate of food and heading  back into my bedroom to be alone again, overwhelmed by the people around  me.I wonder if I am screwing up as a parent? He WANTS to be alone.  Should I be forcing him to come out to places he has no interest in  being? We have a good relationship at home. We talk about things and  laugh a lot. We all have a similar sense of humor, a similar sense of  right and wrong and a similar love for the same things. We have a very  open line of communication when it comes to sex and drugs and right and  wrong. We regularly talk about school and his future plans.When he has a girlfriend he loves to go out with her. He's not going to be a bump of a husband. He's a really good boyfriend.Am I messing up by allowing him to spend so much time alone or am I  allowing him to be who he is? The kid is not depressed. Trust me, I'd be  ALL over that. I just feel weird about it because we are so different  from everybody else. But when I look at it, I think we also have a way  better relationship than some teens/parents.",

        "content": "I was dragged pretty hard by this subreddit. Regardless, if anyone cares, heres an update.  \nFirstly, I have two daughters. I know this site is popular and my daughters frequent this site (which is how I found it), so I wanted to change it up a bit so it didn't scream to them that this post was about youngest daughter if it blew up.   \n\n\n  \nWhen it came to birth control, I have always been open to it. My eldest daughter came to me when she was 16, told me she was having a sexual relationship and wanted to get on birth control. I complied, we got ice cream afterwards. I was not disappointed in her, I never gave any indication to my younger daughter that sex is taboo. My own mother gave me the same promise and threw me out of the house when I took up her offer. Sex and abortion has never been demonized with my house. She was irresponsible and failed me by not coming to me. She's 6-7 weeks pregnant. I have an appointment with a doctor for her on Monday.\n\n  \nMy husband agrees with me but he's not as vocal as I am. He spoke with her at the beginning, and told her he needed time to think. We have discussed it. He's treading carefully. His twin brother was a teen dad. It destroyed a lot of opportunities in his life, whereas he went off to college and is content with his life, his brother had a lot of hardships. He agrees to speak with her with a clear mind.   \nI called the therapist that I saw during my PPD. I made an appointment with her for Tuesday. I haven\u2019t felt this degree of anxiety in years. I had a panic attack yesterday night and I felt like I was going to die. I also called the local planned parenthood and made an appointment for my daughter to receive some counseling. If she doesn't want to listen to me maybe she'll listen to a professional. \n\n  \nI am not planning to throw my daughter on the street. I never was. I was just venting. I now understand that I must take her and if she decides to proceed with the pregnancy, I will have to deal with the kid too. I just think she's being a dumbass kid that's not grounded enough to raise another child. This a girl who KNOWS how to cook but is too lazy to cook, so she'll wait until my husband or I cook to eat. Now onto the update. \n\n  \nMy daughter refuses to give me the name of kid who knocked her up. Said he doesn't his parents to find out. Tough luck. Made an appointment with the principal tomorrow to see if I can track him down. They were having casual sex, and apparently were never \"official\" and people \"don't know about them\".\n\n  \nI sat my daughter down today. I made her stay home from school, and read her a list of things. I told her that one, if she decided to have a child. It will be her sole responsibility. I will not be helping her. I will not change a diaper, I will not babysit. I will help her get government assistance. She is responsible for finding a job and providing for said child. I would feed and house her until she turns 18, then she's getting an eviction notice posted on her door. I told her that there's was gonna be no nursery. Nursery is her room. Any money that was going to be used on her will be given to her, will be used to care for the child. She is disinvited to the yearly family trips that we take, and we snowboard and ski, and that isn't very baby friendly. I will not buy her baby clothes. I will not throw her a baby shower. When it comes down to it, she is to care for this child fully, as I am not it's Mom. \n\n  \nShe freaked out. It turned into a screaming match. Apparently she thought I was going to play Mommy to the child while she got to off to college. It sounded like she wanted a real life doll to play with, not a child. She yelled at me that I was a \"bad mother\" and that I should be willing to help just like (friend of hers who's 17 with a 1 year old)'s mom does. She called me selfish. I snapped. I told her that to me, \"you having a child and ruining everything your father and I have worked for to provide for you is selfish, we worked so hard to set you up for success.\" She started to cry. I started to cry. She told me she's scared of the pain of an abortion. I was baffled. I told her than the pain of birth will kill you. My husband came in and defused the situation, and drove her to best friend's house. Her best friends mom (an old friend of mine) gave me a call and asked me if she could stay over tonight to let her calm down. I agreed. As of my right now, I can't say everything is a breeze.",

Good facilities will precribe you adequate painkillers for the cramping, and if you can, its best to just sleep it off. You need the rest anyway. Please tell her its not as bad as people make it out to be.\n\nAnd i appreciate you as a mother trying to get your daughter to make the right decision. Its not going to be easy for you and its not going to be easy for her, but life will go on, and everything will be okay. Just try to stay calm and make sure you tell her you love her, too.",

        "content": "Hello, I\u2019m a father of three kids. Two girls and one boy, ages 14, 12, and 8. \n\nMy wife is 36years old and I am as well. \n\nAnyways, I have a 14 year old daughter that likes a boy at her school (who is also 14), a lot, and I think the boy likes her too. But anyways, we were at my sons (8yrs) baseball game and my wife and I were sitting down on a bench and watching the game. My other daughter (12yrs) was sitting next to me. And my other daughter was all the way on the left side of the baseball field sitting (where I could see her) next to a boy she likes. They were talking and laughing while eating hot dogs. And five minutes later, I can\u2019t see my daughter anymore. So I got up and went looking for her and as I was walking by the trash can, I see my daughter behind a tree (with the boy) and I noticed she had her hand down the front of this boys pants while they were dry humping each other IN PUBLIC!. I immediately ran back to the bleachers and told my wife to follow me back there because I didn\u2019t know what to do. So I showed my wife and we both stood there in shock. My daughter has never done anything like this before so I was definitely shocked. My wife and I didn\u2019t know what to do. We were both very pissed off. As we were standing there, I heard my daughter say \u201cI have to go to back before my parents realize that I\u2019m gone\u201d. The boy said \u201cok baby I had fun and I\u2019ll comeback with you\u201d.  So my wife and I quickly went back to the bleachers before they could. When they got there they continued to sit together. You might be wondering why didn\u2019t we stop them? Well I didn\u2019t want to embarrass them and us in front of the whole ball park. We knew that if we jerked her away from him right then that it would only have made things worse (our opinion). \nI still feel like we didn\u2019t even handle it good at ALL! \n\nBut when we got home that day my wife and I went and told her that we saw what happened and we\u2019re not happy. We told her that we are very upset that she did this in public in front of the whole ballpark. Even though they were behind a tree it was still very visible. We said that it\u2019s unacceptable and we don\u2019t want that to ever happen again understood? She said that she was sorry and it wouldn\u2019t happen again. So I left the room because I think it was time for her mom to give her a little more advanced sex education talk because obviously she\u2019s experimenting and I know teens are going to do that whether is parents like it or not. My wife talked about sex, consent, and safe sex with her. My wife said she said she understands it and she said she won\u2019t do that in public again. This whole situation makes me wonder if she\u2019s sexually active. Her mom asked her and she said she isn\u2019t sexually active yet. I believe her because she never goes anywhere without our permission and there has to be parents there if she does go somewhere. \n\nThis whole situation has made me wonder what if we didn\u2019t handle it well? Any advice or anything please let me know!! And please let me know if we handled it well or not. Thanks!",

        "title": "Our son might be trans. We're not sure what we should do.",
        "content": "We have a 14-year-old son who says he is transgender. (He was born male, but wants to be female.) We have some questions about what we should do.\n\nFirst, some background on me and my wife. We are both rather liberal, and are supportive on LBGTQ issues. We're also both atheists, so we have no religious objections. I have a cousin who is gay, and the couple that we are closest with have one daughter who is bi and another child (born female) who is transgender. In short, we will be supportive if he really is trans.\n\nHowever, we're not yet sure that he is.\n\nNow some background on our son. He was born male, and has always appeared to be happy as he grew up. He does well in school, generally getting straight A's, and he has a close group of friends (which includes the bi girl and the trans boy I mentioned above, as well as a lesbian). They are all around 14-15 years old, so you get the occasional middle school drama, but generally they seem to really enjoy each other's company.\n\nHe spends most of his time playing on the computer, often in chat with his friends. He has a VR headset, so he spends quite a lot of time in VR chat as well. His computer is in the family room, so we can generally hear what he's saying. As a result, we heard stuff that indicated that he might be trans, but at first it was difficult to tell whether he was just joking around, because he tends to use a female avatar. Eventually we began to realize that he wasn't just joking. We didn't say anything, because we figured it was better to wait until he was ready to tell us.\n\nA few weeks ago, he got angry about something (I forget what) and went into his bedroom to cry/sulk. After giving him a few minutes to calm down, I went in to talk to him. During this conversation, he said that part of the problem was stress. I asked him whether it was stress about being transgender, and he said yes. I asked him how long he had felt that way, and he said maybe a couple of years.\n\nThat bit has me confused. My understanding has been that feelings of being born the wrong sex generally start at a very young age. Our friends with the transgender son say that he first told them at age 6. Our son is saying that he first felt that he wanted to be a girl at age 12.\n\nAlso, he didn't indicate that he thinks he **IS** a girl, just in the wrong body. Instead, he apparently wants to **BECOME** a girl. That also seems different than what I understood about transgender feelings.\n\nWe've told him that we love him, of course. We're just not sure what to do next.\n\nI've read several articles about the subject:\n\n* https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/when-a-child-says-shes-trans/561749/\n* https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/young-trans-children-know-who-they-are/580366/\n* https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/06/i-detransitioned-but-not-because-i-wasnt-trans/563396/\n* https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/07/transition-parents/564008/\n\nBut we still don't know what to do.\n\nMany of these articles talk about homes in which gender roles are fairly strictly adhered to. That's not the case in our home.  His friends are about evenly split between boys and girls. He grew up playing with LEGOs, dinosaurs, Polly Pocket, Nintendo, and whatever else he wanted to play with. There was no \"that's a toy for girls\" stuff.\n\nHe also has always had very long hair, getting his only haircut in the 3rd grade. He asked for it to be cut then because he was tired of politely correcting waitresses who would refer to him as a girl.\n\nHe's generally happy, but he has had the occasional moment of moodiness, maybe a couple of times a month, but nothing unexpected for a young teen. He definitely doesn't seem to be overly depressed, although when he does have those moments of moodiness, he complains about being under a lot of stress.\n\nHe's currently trying to change the pitch of his voice to sound more feminine, but frankly it doesn't sound very good. It sounds like, well, someone trying to do a voice. (And I'm afraid it sounds a bit... creepy?)\n\nHe's also asked that we buy him a dress, although the one he wants in particular is an anime dress for cosplay. He hasn't really said anything about wearing a dress to school.\n\nWe're wondering whether it would be helpful to have him talk to someone else, either a school counselor or a therapist. We don't want it to come across as \"if you think you're transgender, then you must be crazy\". Nor do we want a therapist who will attempt to talk him out of -- or into -- being transgender. We just want someone to help him work through what he's feeling, and help us figure out what we should do.\n\nI'm thinking it might be best for him to remain socially male until the end of this school year. He could then have the summer to work on making the social transition, starting high school as a female.\n\nThen there is the whole question of hormones, legal name change, surgery, etc. We're... confused.\n\nBut I guess the first thing we need to decide is whether it would be helpful for him to talk with a counselor or therapist.\n\nAny advice you can give would be greatly appreciated.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Both my kids went through periods where they felt they may be transgender.  What I did, was I let them make adjustments to their wardrobe and appearance, and respected their pronouns.  I let them guide when/who they would 'come out' to (school, grandparents etc) I talked with the school who were very supportive.  Most of all, I let them know that no matter what, I loved them and would do right by them.  \n\nUltimately, both came to re-embrace their gender as assigned at birth, but to me, the most important thing was that they felt supported no matter their ultimate decision.\n\nI'll add another voice to the chorus suggesting counselling.  If your child does transition, there is going to be a lot for them to navigate and having an unrelated third party available in a professional capacity will help them copy with some of the feelings and situations they might face.",

So we doted on her. She always got whatever she wanted. But we didn't know that we were spoiling her. She turned into this very lazy person, who only parties with her friends, smokes, and I'm sure she does drugs. My sister used to do drugs and I can see the same symptoms in my daughter. Short temper, anxiety issues, those eyes etc. But my husband is in denial and refuses to believe that his beloved daughter is capable of doing such things. She's also promiscuous and openly says that she isn't interested in boyfriend's but is ok with fwb relationships. She even snaps on her 7yo sister who is now afraid to talk to her.(they used to be super close). \n\nI and my husband take full responsibility. We thought it was love but it never crossed us that setting healthy boundaries was a part of good parenting. Being abuse victims ourselves we never set any boundaries because we thought that it was tantamount to abuse. So here we are. She's pregnant now. She agreed to abort the child. \n\nBut what do we do to turn her into a responsible adult. We are clueless. My mother is furious with me and accusing me for not disciplining her. She's suggesting some strict lifestyle changes to her like taking her to the church, and she's suggesting chastity belts so that she learns self control( Yeah she's insane and extremely conservative, so I had to run away when we had our daughter), but I dont want to do anything drastic along those lines. We want to make her feel loved and help her become responsible. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice?",

Set some limits. but remember that she's almost 18, and you aren't going to be able to legally control her for much longer. What you can do, is use the one thing you will have control over, your presence and your money. Set hard boundaries for what she can and cannot do if she wants to continue to live in your home, and then stand by them. Sometimes people have to fall... hard. Being hard on her doesn't make you abusive, it makes you parent.\n\nAlso, cut your mother out of your life. She isn't helping and she sounds like a total bitch.",

If it makes a difference, she\u2019s also told us that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t do that stuff\u201d and we know that she presently also identifies as asexual. \n\nWhat do you think? Also, when is it appropriate to romantically involved teens of any gender sleepover?  \n\nTl;dr: my 15 year old daughter is gay and wants to sleepover with her partner. When is this appropriate?",

The girlfriend sleeps over on the weekends (has a difficult home life) but they are not allowed to sleep in the same bed even though they say they aren\u2019t doing anything sexual. I think it\u2019s a good rule because setting boundaries is important and should apply whether or not pregnancy is a possible consequence to their actions. If they were 18 or older still living at home I think sleeping in the same bed is appropriate but as long as they are still school age, I do not think so.",

I do my best to only play when I'm alone, or my wife and I make an agreement on the length I play while she's home (I'm not currently employed). My wife is currently 15 weeks pregnant.\n\nA few nights ago, I had a dream about our baby (it was a girl in the dream, but we don't know the sex yet) being here, and it was nice to have her finally here. I set the baby down and started playing video games. The dream quickly transitioned from that point to the baby girl being a preteen/teen. I was so taken away that I didn't even realize she'd grown up.\n\nThis brings me to now. Thinking about this dream over the past few days, I'm concerned about myself. I want to be the best father I can, and I'm concerned gaming will get in the way. On the other side, gaming is something I truly love, and don't want to give up that part of my life.\n\nAre there any gamer parents who can share their experiences about how they find balance? Does gaming with children as they grow older harbor a sort of bond, or is it something that should be kept separate from your relationship with them?",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "I had these concerns as well but I think you're already ahead of the game by checking in with your wife on the amount of time you play, etc.\n\nWith a newborn you're probably gonna find that your time is pretty limited, when the baby naps, you'll probably want to nap, your wife will need more time, etc. But, if you can get in some time when everything's taken care of, go for it.\n\nAlso, once the baby is old enough set up a solid schedule for naps, bedtime, dinner, etc. Then you'll know what time your chores and stuff need to be finished by, so like if the laundry is done and he's still napping you can play or do whatever without feeling guilty.\n\nMy son is 2 now and I feel like I get plenty of gaming time either during his naps or after bedtime. Don't fret! There's still room for fun stuff even with a kid",

        "content": "Hello, I am going through a very rough time in my life. I am a 30 year old mother to a 16 y/o teen. We live in Compton, Ca. I had her at 14. I had to grow up at a very fast pace. To give some insight on how I grew up, I had a very verbally abusive crazy Christian mother. I had been molested and was told that I was lying , so this distanced me from my mother. I began messing around with a older man who I thought loved me. Once I told him I was pregnant he left me. Soon I realized that I would start showing and I didn't even bother telling my mom I was pregnant because I knew she would kick me out. So I just packed my things and when she came home from work I told her I was pregnant and that I already know I have to go. She still went on to degrade me and scream and shout. I was staying at some of my friends house and would sleep in the park for about a month and then I met another guy who seemed nice and told me he would take care of me. He accepted my situation. To fastforward, he took care of me but he was abusive. We were together for about 8 years. During the relationship , he introduced me to cocaine. I was addicted. He left me with a broken heart and an addiction. I was super depressed. I continued to use drugs up until about 3 years ago. I know I put my daughter through a lot of pain and abondonment. She saw me be beaten, use drugs and have breakdowns. I wasn't alway kind to her, I would yell at her and call her names when I was mad at other people or wanted to get high. I know that I was a bad mother. I feel like I don\u2019t know her at all. So once I got clean I tried to build a bond with her but all she does is be rude and mean to me. We have our cordial days but I know she still hates me. I noticed strange behavior from her around May. Me and my sister was sitting in my apartment talking in the living room and my daughter rushes out of her room to go downstairs. She was dressed in short shorts and a crop top. I didn't really say anything because it was hot. I thought she was just going outside to talk to one of her friends but once she was gone for more than like 10 minutes, my sister looks outside the window and sees her talking in the driver window of this mans car. A very nice truck. I believe a black escalade. I know that he had to be someone older but I didn't say anything, me and my sister just looked at each other strange. My daughter ended up getting in the car for like 10 min and came back up to the apartment. She is kind of smiling and rushes to her room. Other strange things she does is comes home late from school and on the weekends she comes home like at 2 am. She also has been popping up with chains, Jordans, make up, etc,. I try to not argue with her because I know I have messed up severely in the past so I don\u2019t want to over step my boundaries. So recently , about 2 weeks ago she does the same thing she did when my sister was over, except this was at like 9 pm, but this time when she came in I followed her. She put something in her drawer and rushed into the bathroom, when I opened the bathroom door and she was brushing her teeth and she slammed the door. When I checked the drawer it was a wad of money. I just began to cry because all I could assume was that she gave him oral sex for money. We began arguing and when I asked her was she having sex with him and she tells me that its not my business. I took her phone but she won't unlock it. She left about 3 days ago and have not came home. I texted her that I just want to talk and will not judge her. She told me she hates me. I am lost right now, I am financially stable but not where I can spoil her. I wish I could give her more and let her know I love her. If anyone has any advice, please help me. Im sorry if this is long or all over the place. I am desperate, so I will be posting this on different forums. I don\u2019t know if this is the correct forum for this but I would appreciate any advice .",

Talk to her school.  They may have resources to help her, particularly with whatever is going on at school.\n\n2. Go back to seeing your therapist or get a new one.  A good therapist can help you navigate this.\n\n3. If at all possible, get her in therapy too.\n\n4. Let her know that you love her no matter what, even if you disapprove of her choices.  Tell her that you will always be there if she needs you.  Tell her she can call you any time and you will pick her up, no questions asked.  Ask her questions about her opinions on things and about how things are going; really listen to her answers if she replies without criticizing.  Keep telling her these things over and over even if you don't think she is listening.\n\n5. Remember she is not an adult and you are still the parent.

        "content": "How do I deal with this hell? I will try to make this as short and clear as possible, considered my mental state and my bad knowledge of english\u2026This summer I hacked with my pc into the whatsapp account of my daughter (almost 17) because I wanted to know what was into her mind, she is always so sad and and apathetic, uninterested in life. Beside this, she had experienced weed and she was always mad at us (me and my wife) and never talked to us, although we made every possible effort to start a dialogue with her and giving her all the love and care we could.  I know these behaviors are common to most teens but I KNEW there was more than adolescence in all this\u2026.Reading backward the chat with her best female friend I had one of the most horrible experience  that a father could have\u2026she was revealing to her friend that some years ago, when my daughter was 12/13, she was raped by a boy (she only remember his first name), in our neighborhood. She was hanging out with her friends in late afternoon and on her way back home (100 mt from home) this guy ,a friend of a girl that was a friend of her at the time, but now not anymore, and that she had seen 4/5 time until that day ( she said that he was older than she and her friends, maybe even 18), came out of nowhere suddenly and brought her with force between the trees and brutally abused sexually of my daughter. She wrote that this animal chocked her not to make her scream and at the end he ran away leaving my baby crying in the cold, bleeding. In pain. Alone. Then, after 20 mins she came back home, ran to the bathroom and after, pretend that nothing had never happened. Her friend (the one she was chatting with) was astonished\u2026 she asked who was this guy, and why she didn\u2019t say anything to us. She only answered that she didn\u2019t just want to, only wanted to forget. And, asked why she didn\u2019t want to report to the police, my daughter said that would be useless  after 4 years and given the lack of witness and Italian laws that tends always to protect the offender instead of the victim ( that would be a very LONG and complex topic in itself but i won\u2019t go into that). She said to her friend that in these years she had read on internet many stories and experiences similar to hers and that she had learned how to live with this\u2026I won\u2019t go into describing what happened into me when I finished reading this, also because is impossible to describe it with words\u2026I only say that this is an experience no father should bear. Then i called my wife to make her read the chat\u2026we looked at each other confused then we cried. We didn\u2019t know absolutely what to do\u2026It was dining time and we had to behave normally ( we have another daughter, younger). That night went sleepless\u2026The morning after we called the psychologist my daughter has been seen in the last months and made her read what we had read. she told us to pretend that we didn\u2019t know anything with her, to let her spent the summer quiet and nice, and we would then reprise the therapy in September when, we all together would \u201cbring out\u201d this thing, and then work to try to heal the wounds and live with what happened not by herself alone. We are now at this point. The \u201cthing\u201d has been revealed, my daughter was sitting near the doctor staring at the floor, we didn\u2019t know what to say or do, the doctor asked us how we felt, but I only went to hug my daughter\u2026the doctor (female) told us (me and my wife) to respect the will of my daughter to not talk of this\u2026 for now at least, and that she also doesn\u2019t want any action against the beast that abused her. Every Tuesday we take our daughter to the psychologyst and after 1 hour we take her home. I have to say that she seems more happy and serene\u2026 more so than I seen her in the last years and this is great\u2026I also enrolled her in a painting course and she really enjoy it, breaking away her usual apathy. But me, I am living in hell\u2026trying with the skin of my teeth to cling on to my life\u2026xanax is my best friend and yes, I am seeing a Psychologyst myself but he really cannot relieve my pain. I am in anger with my wife because she seems to have almost forget everything and she almost seems so happy now that we have decided to move from here\u2026all day on the internet to search houses\u2026and I am in anger with her for having let my daughter go out in the evening with her friends and for not watching over her enough (I am always out for work) and for not notice that something serious had happened. And I am in anger with myself because I think I should do something to punish the man that did what he did to my daughter\u2026I don\u2019t even know who he is and where he lives, but even if I did? When we all think at situations like these, when someone hurts the one we love we all think that we would kill him\u2026 but know I think, cold blood, what would I do\u2026if my daughter doesn\u2019t want to report what happened and take legal actions of uncertain results (and that would be stressful and humiliating for her, with countless interrogations digging in the most dirty and gross details). too often in Italy sex abuse is not or poorly condemned and that is like being raped for a second time, not to mention that these guys, once come out of prison (if they ever go there) or even their family could search revenge and do harm to the victim again or to her family\u2026and this is why neither my wife does not want to take action\u2026and this is another reason why I am in anger with her\u2026 returning to the criminal, what would you do yourself? Personally, I have never dealt with violence, and I don\u2019t know what I should do in a situation like this. Go to him and fight and beat him? (would I be able at 51 and never come to  blows with anyone in my life, with a 20 year guy? And even if I could what benefits could bring me? Would I feel better?) Or take a gun and kill him? Rape him? Torture him to death? When I think what he did to my daughter, the pain that caused to her\u2026I think all these things and I KNOW that he has to pay but I don\u2019t know how, is like a ping-pong ball going into my head restlessly\u2026then I think that maybe I should just forget and let all this go\u2026and then at once I blame myself for being a coward, and that I should be a man and go and punish him\u2026I don\u2019t know if I will ever get out of this hell\u2026I am not interested in anything that I did and was before\u2026I am only a man full of rage, anger and sadness, and because I cannot talk of this with anybody I decided to leave this message to read what others would do, because I don\u2019t know anymore what is the right thing to do.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "\\[not a parent\\]\n\nI'm so sorry to hear that someone did that to your daughter.\n\nI'm glad to hear she's seeing a psychologist, and starting to get better. Talking about it with a psychologist, who's equipped and prepared to help people deal with those experiences, can be very helpful.\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong. Someone did something bad to your daughter, but that's unfortunately the world we live in. Restricting girls and women out of fear isn't great for them, either, and as scary as it is, you can't protect her from the world.\n\nI'm not surprised she didn't tell you. My experiences weren't so clear and violent as your daughter's, but someone ~~sexually assaulted~~   ~~raped~~ didn't take no for an answer with me when I was in high school. I felt ashamed whenever I thought about it. I just wanted to pretend it never happened, only I couldn't forget it, and I don't trust men when it comes to dating and sex. It took me a few years to even start to talk about it with anyone.\n\nYou're being a good parent. You're daughter is seeing a psychologist. She's opening up about it. It seems like she's starting to do better. You're upset that he did that to your daughter, like any good parent would be. But your daughter needs you, and you can't be a good parent from prison.\n\nAs you said, it's infuriating to see someone get away with that, but it's not fair to your daughter to make her trauma worse in the process of trying to punish him if she isn't up for it. I think the best thing you can do is have her see a psychologist, support her in her decision whether she wants to go to the police or not, and make sure she knows you still love her and this was not her fault. It sounds like you're already doing these things.\n\nI can't speak for how your wife is feeling or what your wife is doing, but I'll mention that people deal with awful things in different ways. For some people, coping is avoiding thinking about something awful because they feel like there is nothing they can do, and allowing themself to think about it just makes them feel more helpless. I don't think this means your wife doesn't care.\n\nI'm not a parent, and I'm older than your daughter. I can tell you that if my parent ever found out what happened to me, I'd want them to tell me that they're sorry, that it wasn't my fault, and that they love me.",

Heads up this will be long. \n\nOur 13 y/o boy has been showing his little brother porn. He's with us only on weekends. We've taken away all his device access and what he can use is heavily monitored when he's with us. It hasnt been a problem in a several months. He went to grandmas with the little ones this past weekend and got his hands on a tablet. Started showing my just barely 7 y/o how to search for porn and showed him videos. 7 y/o was very upset and told.\n\nThis has been an ongoing problem. He has done this last year with my now 8 y/o. We've been teaching sex ed since l.o. came up asking about oral sex out of the blue and found out. We cut off all device access and have been building up trust to where the eldest has been allowed to use devices closely monitored. The first chance he got...he rook it and ran with it.\n\nWe had a similar issue when eldest was around 8-10 and got caught looking for stripper and hooker videos on YouTube. At the time he said it made him feel gross. We worked with him and things got better but its become a serious issue now.\n\nI'll put it out there. I am a childhood sexual abuse survivor. I really don't take well to my 13 y/o tainting my innocent babies. I dont know how to get him help. And i want to keep them from this stuff as long as possible. Sex is great...its not a bad thing. But i really dont want their sexual ideations based on porn. Idk what - exactly - hes showing them. \n\nHe also steals and lies impulsively. I'm really worried about his future but I also want to protect the little ones. \n\nHis mom doesn't take it seriously. Shes a therapist and this stuff gets shrugged off. I don't understand. \n\nWhen he recently got caught with porn there it seemed to be a big blow out. She sent him here for a week and he had no phone at her place 2-4 weeks.  Just the other day he left his phone on top of his moms car...good riddance! (He can only use it for emergencies when here). He was bragging about how sad he was aboit it because he just got YouTube and internet back. WTF!! I was shocked when this has been an issue for so long and she has been aware of it. \n\nWe don't have him often and are very poor. I want to get him in for a psych eval and therapy but idk how. With the limited time and funds as well as being a noncustodial parent. Im so worried about how this behavior will affect him growing as a teen and into young adulthood. Also, again, dont want the babes exposed to this.\n\nWe have a small house and the 3 share a room. I sleep in what used to be the living room its an open space and on the flip side of the enormous fireplace that acts as a divider is our game room. I want to take him out of the boys room and put him in the opposite room on his mattress or an air mattress for the time being while we figure out how to go forward.\n\nSo. Do I have a tiny porn addict on my hands; is that possible? How do I get him help for his implusive behaviors? Is it wrong to seperate him from them if it means lack of privacy for a pubescent teen? How can I better protect the little brothers? Ugh.\n\nIm just so frustrated and disgusted. This was not what I expected for raising 3 boys. I love them but I'm not well equipped for this die to my background.

They usually sit and talk and laugh during.\n\nSo the other night I was in our ensuite, and they came in the room. I don\u2019t think either one realized I was there. My daughter asked my wife about getting her a sex toy. I was losing my shit internally hearing this, but much to my wife\u2019s credit, she stayed calm, asked why she thought she needed one, etc., eventually told her no, she is too young and should learn to use her hands before exploring with toys, and she didn\u2019t think toys would be appropriate for a few years. All in all they probably had a 3 minute discussion then my daughter went to bed and my wife went to tuck in our son. \n\nI used that opportunity to leave the bathroom. My wife came to bed, and never mentioned the conversation she had with our daughter. I didn\u2019t either. \n\nI\u2019ll be honest, im a little bothered by it. Nothing inappropriate was said, and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just my discomfort to thinking of my baby girl like that (I know, she\u2019s not just my daughter, but a person and I need to get over it. And I will, it\u2019s just she\u2019s my little girl) but it also seems kind of strange. Never in a million years would I have talked to either of my parents about masturbation as a teen, I don\u2019t even think I could talk to them now.\n\nDo you think it\u2019s possible for our teens to be *too open* with their parents?",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "I don\u2019t think a child should ever feel like they shouldn\u2019t / can\u2019t talk to a trusted adult.  It speaks VOLUMES about your daughters maturity level that she trusts her mother enough to ask her about these things.  That maturity will serve her well throughout life, and will also be great if she ever has kids of her own.  \n\nI can understand your reaction.  Likely I would react the same way.  But step back, think about the bigger picture:  you have a daughter who TRUSTS and listens to you.  That is priceless.  Because the opposite is very very hard, trust me.",

        "content": "I\u2019ve never been so distraught in my entire life, and I feel like an abysmal failure of a mother. What parent allows their 13 year old child to even be seriously dating, let alone having sex? How did it even happen? I\u2019ve always prided myself on staying vigilant and present in my daughters life, and have done my best to keep an open dialogue. My daughter has had several \u201cboyfriends\u201d but never anything serious or more than inviting them to family movie nights, ordering pizza and playing video games or maybe dropping them off at the mall for a few hours. I\u2019ve done my best to make sure she has the proper supervision, without being overly restrictive or helicoptering. We\u2019ve talked about sex many time and I\u2019ve been clear that it is a normal thing to do, but within the confines of a safe, healthy relationship when you\u2019re emotionally mature enough to handle all the intimate complexities and consequences that come with sharing your body with someone. I\u2019ve personally only ever been with my husband, and while I didn\u2019t expect her to wait until marriage, I did expect her not to just give it up to the first boy that asked. \n\nShe came to me a few weeks ago and told me she\u2019d had her first kiss at her schools end of year field day. I was happy she felt that she could trust me and told her I was happy for her, but I did let her know that I felt that while peck kissing was perfectly fine, anything more than that at this age is definitely inappropriate. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m a prude, but I don\u2019t believe 13 year olds should be exploring past 1st base at this point in the emotional development. She assured me that she wasn\u2019t comfortable going any farther than kissing and that she only did it because she was the last of her friends to have their first kiss. Admittedly I should\u2019ve seen that as more of a red flag, but I remembered being 13 and know that peer pressure can be intense. I made sure to tell her that she should never do anything she\u2019s not comfortable with just because other people might be ready before her. \n\nI noticed my daughter seemed much more withdrawn and irritable lately, and I was starting to worry but also figured hey, she\u2019s 13, it\u2019s rough. I opted to give her some space and not really force her to talk to me about it just yet. I assumed her and her best friend were in a fight, since she hadn\u2019t been coming by lately. After a couple days of her locking herself in her room, not eating, and hearing her cry in the bathroom several times a day, her father and I decided to sit her down this morning and ask her what exactly was wrong. She just sat at our table in silence with a blank expression on her face, and wouldn\u2019t even look at us. I asked if she was having problems with her best friend, if we\u2019d done something that\u2019d upset her or if something was going on online that I needed to know about. Nothing. No expression, not even one worded answers. I was starting to get a very bad feeling in my gut and asked to see her phone. She *flipped her sh!t*. My daughter has never even so much as breathed wrong in her father and I\u2019s direction, with the exception of some very normal/mild preteen and teen attitude, so I was very caught off guard. She began screaming at us to leave her alone, to \u201cmind our f***ing business\u201d, that we \u201cdon\u2019t need to know sh!t\u201d and to F off. She got up from the table and tried to walk out our front door and my husband grabbed her and just tried to bear hug her until she calmed down. I\u2019d never seen her so explosive and distraught and to be honest it scared the hell out of me. I actually though she\u2019d had a nervous break down. \n\nAfter awhile, she calmed down. We took her phone, she tried to snatch it away from us one last time but I took her by the arm with me upstairs and sat her down in my bedroom. That\u2019s when the tears just came. She was absolutely inconsolable. I couldn\u2019t understand a word she was saying and she began hyperventilating. At this point I started crying too, just out of pure fear and confusion. My daughter has always been a very happy, excitable girl with bare minimum behavior issues. She\u2019s always smiling and hanging out with her friends, making everyone laugh. This was a side of my daughter I didn\u2019t recognize. \n\nThat\u2019s when she dropped the bomb on me, she\u2019s pregnant. I felt so sick I was dizzy. I didn\u2019t know what else to do so I just hugged her and cried with her. My husband found us upstairs and looked bewildered, so I pulled him into the hallway and told him. He just walked off. Just got in his truck and drove away. He\u2019s been gone since noon and keeps forwarding my calls to voicemail. I feel so scared for my daughter and overwhelmed, and I hate that he just up and left me with this all by myself. I took my daughter to our local health department this afternoon and had them do a test to be sure. She\u2019s definitely pregnant. My 13 year old child is pregnant and life doesn\u2019t even seem real anymore. She\u2019s being sent in for a dating scan next week, but from the day of her last period, she could be nearing 10 weeks along. She just started her period at the beginning of the school year, and she hasn\u2019t been regular. The girl doesn\u2019t even know how to use a tampon and she\u2019s pregnant. How could we have failed her this badly? How does this even happen? I\u2019m just..defeated? I don\u2019t even know what I am to be honest. I can\u2019t find the proper words to express this feeling. \n\nAfter some discussion, I\u2019ve discovered that the father is a 16 year old neighbor kid that I\u2019ve literally only met twice? Maybe 3 times? He does lawn care in our neighborhood during the summers and I\u2019ve had him mow our lawn once. I didn\u2019t even know they knew each other, let alone had been having sex. How did I not know? She told me that under no circumstances will she get an abortion. She told me she won\u2019t kill her baby and that if I try to make her, she\u2019ll just disappear. I would never ask her to do something like that and I certainly wouldn\u2019t force her, but she won\u2019t even hear what I have to say about adoption and she\u2019s made it clear she wants to raise this baby. Any time I\u2019ve brought up adoption or talking to someone at the pregnancy crisis center, she shuts down and stops talking to me. I asked her if she\u2019d told the father, she said that she told him on Tuesday, and that he offered to take her to the clinic for an abortion and when she said she planned on raising the baby, he blocked her number. She said she tried walking down to his house but no one would open the door. \n\nI\u2019m sick, furious, confused and so so scared. What the actual f**k do I do? What even is the next step in this situation? My daughter is barely an 8th grader and she wants to have a baby? I\u2019ve stressed over and over how unbelievably hard her life is going to be. I\u2019ve explained to her that she\u2019ll likely have no choice but to homeschool, she\u2019ll likely have a hard time finding a job and never be able to go to a university. She\u2019s going to live in poverty and be a single mother. I\u2019ve tried telling her that she deserves so much more from her life and that a baby deserves a mother who can provide for it properly, and that she have her whole life to become a mother. What 13 year old wants to have a baby?! I\u2019ve tried to explain the gravity of the situation and the seriousness that is raising a life, but I just don\u2019t think she\u2019s hearing me. We really can\u2019t afford to raise another baby but I don\u2019t know what other choice we have. \n\nI know this is long, but the last 10 hours of my life has been like a dream. I have no idea where my husband is, my barely not baby is having a baby, we can\u2019t afford another child and I don\u2019t think my marriage would survive something like this. It\u2019s been sort of cathartic to get this out there, since I don\u2019t really have anyone to tell right and and honestly, I don\u2019t think I even want to. Reddit, what do I do? Because I just want to lay down in a hole and cry right now. I really just need some direction and support right now because I\u2019m at a completely loss. \n\nEdit: I contacted my local non emergency line and they sent out two officers to my home. I\u2019d looked through my daughters phone and read the messages between her and neighbor kid. They\u2019d apparently been texting since before the school year ended. Before she told me about her first kiss. They\u2019d made plans to have sex at his house while his family was out of town for a long weekend. They both seemed eager. My daughter actually was the initiator, but it\u2019s very clearly obvious that he took advantage of her eagerness and desire to \u201cfinally\u201d lose her virginity. She sent him a few nude pictures as well. That was hard to read. Still not as hard as the half assed police work we have in this town of ours. I went down the street to the boys house with the officers and the parents and the boy walked out onto the lawn. The parents seemed less than concerned about the situation and were hardly helpful. The kid (I\u2019ll call him H) claimed that my daughter sought him out and \u201cpractically begged\u201d him to have sex with her, and that the baby probably wasn\u2019t his because he made sure to \u201cpull out\u201d. Honestly, I could\u2019ve killed him with my bare f***ing hands at that point, but I didn\u2019t need an assault charge on top of this madness. The parents requested to see the text between them and the officers also asked to read them. Essentially, after a heated 30 minutes, the officers declined to arrest this kid since I guess in my state there\u2019s a close in age clause for 14-18 year olds and since my daughter will be 14 in September, they just saw it as two hormonal teens, not a real crime. The officer also politely informed me that my daughter could actually be charged herself for distributing child pornography. They said it\u2019s probably best if we handle this \u201cin house\u201d. The parents then informed me that I could contact them with a lawyer if I wished to discuss this any further and that I should wrangle in my \u201cfast ass daughter\u201d. I\u2019m absolutely seething and I want to fight someone.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "I had a baby when I was 14. I don't know what you should do, but here's what I wish my parents did.\n\nYour husband is causing damage to your daughter by running from this. My father literally shunned me for one month, didn't even look at me, and 20 years later I am still affected by it. He needs to put his emotions aside and so do you, and you both need to buckle down and work through this together. Your previous dreams, desires and plans for her are gone. The fork in the road has passed and for you and your daughter especially, life has been altered dramatically no matter what choice she makes regarding this baby. Some women can easily adapt after birth/abortion/adoption and some just can't. You don't know which one your daughter is, so there is no \"better option\" for her. \n\nWith proper support, she can still succeed if she decides to keep this baby. It can happen as long as you and your husband are willing to adapt with her and support her fully. \n\nTherapy will be necessary no matter the choice she makes. Most people know that having a baby as a teen means work and late nights and no more parties etc, but what most don't realize is how it affects all of your relationships. She may lose friends, she may find it hard to make friends. Other parents may not allow their child to be friends with her. She will no longer be \"girlfriend material\" ...for years. I assure you, the majority of boys willing to date a teen mom are by far not the cream of the crop. This sounds harsh, but in my experience, it just is what it is. She needs to be prepared for this change as well. \n\nIf you want to try to convince her that giving her baby up for adoption is the best option or help prepare her for part of what's to come, (this sounds extreme but I honestly wish my parents did this) I suggest having her babysit full time after school. Preferably a baby or young toddler. Or maybe you \"babysitting\" while she does all the work (since some women might be hesitant leaving their baby with a 13 year old.) I know for me and for many teen moms I knew throughout highschool, if we had the opportunity to really know what we were in store for, some of us would have not only chose a different path but done so more confidently.\n\nAnyway I can go on and on about this. Having been through it, helping teen mother's is my life's passion and I plan to one day soon open a non profit to do so further so believe me when I tell you that you can get through this as long as you all stick together. I know it doesn't feel like it right now but this isn't the end. Just stick together. Sending you positive vibes.",

He does not have a good relationship with our dad so he moved in with me (3 hr from our Mom), changed schools, and seemed to be doing great here.\n\nI take his phone every night-every other night to check messages and make sure he\u2019s not expressing suicidal thoughts to anyone. Last night I found a long message to a new friend at new school and it is almost completely fabricated.\n\nHe starts with his birth. He said he was born one month early (not true he was born the day after his due date) and was messed up when he was born.  He said he was a born with a physical disability and is legally disabled (not true-he was born with some delays but had physical therapy and was doing fine).  He said his whole childhood he was pushed to the back-attention-wise.  He said our uncle killed him self and that caused our dad to become an abusive alcoholic (not true-uncle died from DT\u2019s withdrawing from alcohol and while Dad did drink a lot he was never abusive).  He said he moved out of state with our mom and kids immediately started bullying him, beating him unconscious, shoving his arm into metal on a locker and cutting him until he was faint from blood loss (Mom says while he was bullied it was never physical).  He said he began dating a girl and all they ever did was drop acid, smoke weed, have sex, and he would get drunk every day (Mom says there is no way any of that is true).  \n\nNow the suicide part:  In his message he says that his suicide attempt involved him cutting his arm and drinking a bleach/detergent mixture so he would bleed out while he died, then our mom walked in and found him covered in blood and unconscious and took him to the hospital.  This is NOT true. While he did cut his arm it was a week prior and he drank 1/2 cup of detergent and immediately started throwing up and called 911 himself. My mom was at work and she met them at the hospital.  \n\nWhy is he lying?  If he moved away to get a fresh start then why is he telling this new friend all his skeletons?  He has always been a very VERY quiet kid and I\u2019m trying hard to get him to talk to me and I\u2019ve bought a book on depression and I\u2019m having him do some exercises in it but he does go to counseling bi-weekly.\n\nMy parents are the worst communicators ever (with each other). They hardly speak to each other and instead they will tell me, \u201cwell he\u2019s been raised like this for a long time so now you have to change that\u201d, or ask me if I\u2019ve talked to him about all this.\nI don\u2019t mind to talk to him about things but I am so stressed with trying to raise him, since I have 2 small kids, husband, and full-time job of my own.",

        "content": "I need advice. Obviously we screwed up as parents, but I need help with figuring out how to proceed. This is my wife's account but she asked me to write everything. \n\nMy son is 14, soon to be 15. He has aspergers and sensory processing disorder. He is very high functioning and for the most part lives a typical life for a teen. \n\nAgainst the odds (he's less than smooth, likely due to aspergers) he got a girlfriend in the beginning of 8th grade last year. We'll call his girlfriend \"Ann\". When they started hanging out we spoke to our son about consent, safer sex practices, and we expressed a desire that he wait to get physical with Ann until they are both at least a bit older. My son reacted a bit childishly at the time, seemed a bit grossed out, and brushed off any need to discuss sex further. \n\nWe thought we did the right thing, had the conversation about sex, and after that didn't worry about it.\n\nAnn seemed to be a nice girl. A year older than my son but in terms of maturity they seemed on even terms. Ann has always been kind to my son and patient when he gets over stimulated. They got along well and we even met Ann's parents at a school function. They seemed like nice, average people. \n\nSix months into Ann and my son dating my son came to me and told me he had to tell me something and he didn't want me to be angry. I braced myself for trouble at school, poor grades, something along those lines. Instead he tells me that Ann is pregnant and he is the father. \n\nI could not believe it. I asked him over and over if he was sure. He said he was sure, Ann showed him the pregnancy test, and she is going to tell her parents that night.\n\nA lot of things have happened since then. \n\n- Ann's parents were upset at first but quickly (a little too quickly I think)  they accepted it and began actually acting excited for a grandchild. I cannot relate to those feelings. \n\n- Ann and her parents would not consider abortion or adoption even considering our children's ages (14, and 15).\n\n- Ann decided to keep the baby and had a healthy pregnancy and birth. \n\n- My son talked about how he intended to help Ann and be a father to this child. He did not think it would be very hard. We assured him that newborn children and beyond are very difficult to raise and it would not be easy in any sense.\n\n- My SO and I have been devastated and feel like we have failed as parents and failed to be involved enough to prevent this. I take full responsibility for not preventing this situation. I struggle every day to get up and face the world knowing I've failed in such a serious way. \n\n- My wife insisted once the baby was born that a paternity test be done just to be sure my son was the father. Ann's parents were very offended by this and it led to some tension. My son is the father. \n\nNow on to the real issue. After the paternity test Ann's parents were offended at what such a test implies. They no longer wish to speak to my wife and I. \n\nMy son was present for the (very awkward) birth and he was vocal about not wanting to see it happen and not wanting to be stuck sitting around at the hospital. We told him tough luck and that this was going to be the first of many things he's going to have to do even if he doesn't enjoy it. He said the smells and lights at the hospital bothered him (again, he has  sensory processing disorder). We did not let him leave though. \n\nMy son has not enjoyed holding his daughter or caring for her. Ann and her parents do 99% of the care for the baby but my son goes there after school each day to spend time with Ann and baby. He tells us he hates it. He can't stand the baby screaming and crying. He can't stand the smell of breast milk or poop coming from the baby. He had his first melt down in years while at Ann's house when the baby would not stop crying. He basically had a tantrum in front of Ann and her parents about not liking the baby. \n\nAnn's parents told him not to come back. They expressed that they will seek child support from us but do not want my son around Ann or the baby anymore. My son is thrilled to be let off the hook. We don't know how to feel. \n\n1) Do we as the grandparent's of a minor parent have to supply child support? \n\n2) Should we allow our son to just ignore the fact that he had a baby with someone and just return to normal teenage life? \n\n3) Should we take Ann and her parents to court to fight for at least partial custody of a baby that my son wants nothing to do with? \n\nI have no idea how to handle this situation and we are at the end of our rope. Everyone else involved seems ready to let my son off the hook in terms of responsibly to this child except my wife and I. But we don't know what the right thing to do is. \n\nCan someone, anyone, relate? What can we do? What should we do?

My son went on a date recently and I tried to casually talk to him about dating, sex, and protection, but he shrugged and told me he knew about everything already. \n\nI don't know. I feel like I have failed them in some way. I always dreamed of having an open relationship with them where we can talk about this kind of stuff, but they want nothing to do with it. I have no clue if the oldest has had sex. I have no clue if my daughter has had her first kiss. I'm not really asking for advice. I just needed to get this out.

By bringing this stuff up, you have shown them you are open to talking about it, and that is a world away from it being taboo.\n\nIt's perfectly ok and normal for them to not want to talk to you about these things. My mom was very liberal and always very open about bodies/sex ... and around puberty I acted exactly like your kids. I wanted my privacy and had no interest or need to talk to my mom. However, it did matter that I knew I could talk to her if I needed to.",

Few friends and has only had a couple boy interests in r/l and 2 online (that I would like to hunt down with a baseball bat). Without getting too much into nitti grity that would be identifiable, (she and her friends are all on reddit) I have a couple questions. \n\nDetails first loving home, only child, spoiled to death. We are heavily engaged in helping her through her education process. She has known about sex and relationships for years (learning incorrect bits at school that we later corrected). We have a policy that she can ask anything she wants and not be embarrassed, and from time to time she asks questions that we say, none of your business or its for you to discover when your older. She is on Birth control for \"cramp issues\". We know she has been sexually active though she allegedly hasn't gone all the way. Recently she has started acting odd, for example watching something as simple as tv and if a sex scene starts up (regular cable tv so you know its not graphic) then she gets angry as hell. Says she hates that everything is about sex. \n\nI mentioned it to the wife who blew it off without much explanation. It happened again one day, PG-13 level sex scene on and I could tell she is getting all angry. So I asked. The answer I got was nothing was wrong, nobody was pressuring her or anything, nothing had happened, but she is tired of it being thrown in her face all the time because she now wants to participate and knows she shouldn't be yet. I was kinda taken aback but accepted it. When I mentioned it to my wife she jumped me and said \"You dumb ass I told you it was fine, she is a girl she has raging hormones just like boys and she wants it, now you probably embarrassed the shit out of her for no good reason.\"\n\nI'm not a total idiot, or so I thought I realize girls have desires and needs too but to me this sounds like its off the chart compared to what in my mind I thought of girls going through puberty would be like. Am I just that damn naive or is it the whole things pounded into our heads as kids that boys are the dirty ones who will try to bed everything in site. \n\nAt this point should I just be letting everything go or should I be holding tightly on the reins? Ugh. Anyone think she needs a counselor? I want her to grow up healthy and happy and not have hangups like so many from my generation and before did.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Girls want sex as much as boys. However, boys and girls grow up in different cultures. As a woman, I can only speak to the girls side.\n\nGirls grow up with the world telling them boys only want them for their bodies, and boys who only want them for their bodies is bad. Is telling girls to both stay away from these types of boys all the while saying all boys are like this confusing? Hell yeah. Girls also grow up with the world telling them that their most precious commodity is their body, and they should protect it from everything because it's special (implying sexual activity will taint it, or even ruin it). So basically, people tell girls that their body is the  most important thing about them, but boys who agree their body is the most important thing about them are evil. Geez, this really is confusing! Oh yeah, also, girls who think about sex are WHORES or SLUTS. Boooo on them!\n\nThis is where you, the parents, need to cut the BS. A girl's body is not any more important than any other aspect that makes her....well, her. Her mind, her humor, her interests, her personality, and her body are all equal parts of her. Someone interested in only one of these, and not really the others, shouldn't get her time of day. Well, maybe a casual friendship, but definitely not a dating partner.\n\nAlso, like Tina from Bob's Burgers, it's totally normal for girls think about sex. A LOT. I want to say just like boys, but I can't know that for sure. \n\nI do think it's healthy for you and your wife to talk about what's making her angry. I didn't fully realize the hypocrisy of girls and sex to a later age, so it could be something else. But this is the world she's in, and I hope I've helped you understand it more :)",

        "title": "Why is it frowned upon to make rules about sex?",
        "content": "So, I was scrolling over my parenting groups feed in FB and came across the usual funny picture of a teen daughter wearing a shirt that read \"stay off, boys, this is my dad\" and a picture of said dad all buff like. The usual rabble started in the comments: How dare this man impose his will on his daughter, she's a minor he can do w/e, this is not the dark ages, all boys are rapists, it's her body, not in my house, she's not an object you own. Etc. etc. etc.\n\nso, it made me wonder: Why is making rules about sex such a controversy these days?\n\nSurely, we make rules about other things, things *much* more banal, such as: How late can you stay up on a school night? Can you eat twinkies instead of dinner? Are you allowed to watch TV on school nights? How much video games to play? et cetera.\n\nWhy is it NBD if dad says \"no stacy, you can't go to rhonda's house tonight, we're getting up early tomorrow\".\n\nBut if dad says \"no stacy, you can't have sex with your boyfriend, we can't afford to raise grandkids\", it's a BFD.\n\nKids are ... for a lack of a better term ... dumb. If I let my teen decide what to do after school, they would make some terrible decisions at times, and that's with simple stuff like planning homework, being on time, choosing foods. Obviously there's the \"well they're gonna do it anyway\", but you have that for all things in your kids life. I'm not gonna chaperone my kid every second until they turn 18, some things you *obviously* have to teach your kid, then rely on their judgement. For example: I'll let my 16yo drive, but they're not allowed to drive on the freeway - i'm not with them all the time, and I accept there is a chance they took the freeway to their friends' house and not surface streets, but the rule stands, if they get busted, they get punished.\n\nSo, I'm not going to share my exact views/rules to what my kid can and can't do in terms of sex, because it will probably just turn in to me defending those choices, instead I wanted to see people's thoughts on why it's such a controversy for parents to put up a rules framework around sex these days.\n\nMy opinion, though? Each family should be able to choose their own rules around sex as long as the child doesn't fare ill.",

I realize that this is just my biased opinion, but she's the adult, she pays the rent, and her judgement is the authority.  As long as we're being reasonable, we're not doing anything wrong.

He got involved with a niche Discord group earlier this year and seems to have found several online buddies to talk to on a daily basis (more like hourly!)  \n\nI can see his chats on our home computer although he uses his phone for chatting, since he occasionally uses the PC and it seemingly never logs out.  I only monitor, and while the conversations turn a bit lewd at times it's been nothing shocking...I'm an open, sex positive person who realizes this is normal teen male speak, especially under the guise of anonymity.  I don't feel bad about monitoring this.  He is a minor, and my child, and I'm his parent, not his friend.  I don't ask him about it or even bring it up, but I have to make sure he is being safe and also kept so.\n\nBut then, today, I found a private conversation where he talked about his sexual turn ons, sent \"audio\" material...and this person (a male) also offered to send him a sex toy to our home.  My son, who has always been seemingly Internet savvy, wrote that he will give him our home address when he gets home because he can't remember it (he's at his dad's out of town at the moment.)\n\nHe will be home tomorrow.  I have to say something.  I'm dreading having to reveal that I saw the explicit things he wrote, although I don't judge him for it, but this is entering dangerous and possibly illegal territory.  I'm contemplating blocking his Internet entirely...I'd take his phone but he's home alone sometimes while I'm at work and we don't have a landline.  Anyone have any tips or experiences with this?

I could be wrong, but I highly doubt it. \n\nNumber 2 - he's going to be a legal adult in a year.  Blocking the internet isn't going to solve this issue, which is that he's potentially engaging in unsafe behavior - it's just as dangerous as an adult as when you're a child.  \n\nNumber 3 - In my opinion, a 17 year old should have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  Your constant monitoring and reviewing of his only social outlets is not normal behavior as a parent of a 17 year old.  A 12 year old? Sure.  But it's time to loosen the reins a bit.   \n\nWhat I would recommend is sitting down with him and talking to him about his relationships, how he's doing, try to get him to open up.  Tell him you know most of his relationships are online, and just tell him you want him to be safe - if he's going to meet someone, meet in public, don't give your address out, etc.  I would not tell him you've been monitoring his conversations because that will probably tank your relationship with him in a hurry.",

On the way there, she was reading a book called something like \"The Smart Girl's Guide to Boys\".  It talks about boys and crushes and feelings and dances and parties and appropriate behavior, all aimed at pre-teen girls.\n\nOn the car ride home, we had a \"do you know where babies come from?\" talk.  She knew that dads were somehow involved, but didn't know exactly how.\n\nSo for the next 45 minutes or so, we covered the following topics:\n\n* Female anatomy  (uterus, Fallopian tubes, ovaries)  \n* Menstruation  (already well covered from mom)\n* Male anatomy  (penis, testicles, sperm)\n* Foreplay  (wetness, hardness) \n* PIV  \n* Orgasm  \n* Fertilization  \n* Pregnancy/birth  \n\nFrom there, there were some followup questions.  She said deduced that my wife and I have had sex twice, since we have two kids.  So we talked about recreational sex.  That quickly led to birth control.  We talked about STDs and the emotional aspects of sex, and how important it is to know/trust/be committed to your partner.  We have friends who are a lesbian couple with a child, so we talked about how they got pregnant and had a baby (though I admit some of the finer details of this remain fuzzy to me).  \n\nWhile I feel like I covered a lot of ground, I really didn't go into a whole lot of depth.  For example, birth control was basically \"There is medicine that a woman can take to stop herself from getting pregnant.  Or there is something a man can wear on his penis, kind of like a little sock, that catches the sperm so it doesn't go into the woman.\"  That level of detail.\n\nAll in all, it was a great talk.  Neither of us were embarrassed the slightest.  She asked some questions, but wasn't fascinated or disgusted or particularly moved by any of it.  I told her this was all more useful information for when she was older, but to just stick it in her back pocket for now.  Mostly I'm just hoping it leaves the forefront of her brain by the time winter break is over and she goes back to school so she doesn't go blab it to all her friends.

The problem is that in the last year/few months things have gotten out of control because my husband almost encourages them to this kind of things, for example a few months ago i found out my son was using modafinil and ritalin to catch up on school, which i wasn't happy about at all, my husbands (he uses different kind of pills that he buys online without a script, some stimulants before work and tranquilizers to relax after work) was defending him and saying this pills are prescribed for adhd and that since kids can take them they aren't dangerous and that since my son has started with the pills his grades have improved a lot so it's ok, he had a point and also has used similiar stuff for many years so i didn't worry and decided to ignore it as summer was coming and i hoped that this year he would start to study more from the beginning so he wouldn't have to rely on the pills, anyway i also found out my daughter was taking pills too, ativan and valium, because she said she was stressed from school and was having anxiety and trouble sleeping and my husband totally ignored the situation as if it was most normal thing in the word and told me since school was about to end to ignore it and that it's just a bad time for her and she will get over it. Now school has just started and the situation isn't any better, actually is worst, my son is tired in the morning because he is still getting used to waking up early again, my husband advice: ''drink a coffee, smoke a couple cigs and take an adderall''\nThen my son procedes to tell him he doesn't have any adderall and my husband give him one, also my daughter was telling me she has beeb having serious anxiety and wants to get counseling, and he tells her to take her pills (unprescribed pills) she says she already as so he says he will give her one of her xanax and some of his indica weed and that would resolve everything and counseling is stupid and expensive.\nShe also wants to quit smoking cigarettes (has been smoking for 1 year and also vaping with an e cig we buy when we found out she was smokibg cigs, did the same for our son) and only vapes and has been able to quit down from 5 cigs a day to 3 a day and my husband instead of encouraging her to quit tells her it's ok if she just keeps smoking 3 just for pleasure since she is getting the majority of the nicotine from the e cig and not to stress to much about it. Also during the summer he has taken the kids to the bar and drink with them (it's legal in our state to drink underage with a parent) and to the weed dispensary to pick weed with them and choose strain with them, also he often drinks and smokes weed with them at home, and sometimes get very drunk and high (i do drink some beers/wine or smoke a joint with them, but i don't do it often and i don't get drunk or high with them) and smokes cugarettes with them and they bum them off each other and sometimes he buys them cigarettes when they can't get it from friends (i don't let them smoke cigarettes around me, they have to smoke in their bedroom and i only let them vape around me, also i don't give them my cigarettes) also recently my son has said he would try to have a 2.5 gpa so maybe he can get into college, and my husband tells him to just not go under 2.0 and it's gonna be fine and he can get into comunity college and rent an apartment with friends and that he should have fun since it's his last year of highschool, he also has also has been dating a girl for 8 months and she cames at our house regularly and often sleeps here so that we can make sure they're having safe sex, she is a nice girl and i'm happy they're dating but my husband tells him to play around with other girls and that he won't be findibg the right one at 17 so he should have fun with other girls too, which i don't agree with at all. Anyway  i've been ignoring this stuff to avoid drama but we really hit rock bottom when a few weeks ago we picked up my son from a party because he was high on ecstasy and couldn't came back by himself. I have done ecstasy as a teen and i know it's not the worst drug in the world but it's dangerous and i am definitely not gonna allow my son to do it, so next day i gave him a lecture about the dangers of this stuff and how i know it's his life and i can't control him but this shit can have serious conceques on his health and future. My husband instead rolled him a joint, gave him a coffee and an aspirin to help with the ''ecstasy hangover'' and told him that if he wants to do it again he shouldn't take more than half a gram and to drink water not alcohol with it and buy a test kit then procedes to tell him stories about stupid shits he has done when he was a teen. Honestly i was shocked and i confronted him about it saying that our son could have died from it and he is being irresponsible, his response was that i'm exagerating the situation and that he is normal for kids to experiment with this kind of this and that at his age we were a lot worst and that at his age he was doing multiples drugs together every weekend, drinking and smoking weed and 20 cigs everyday, shoplifting, dealing weed and pills and getting into fights, having sex, often unprocteded with random girls, dropping out of school multiple times and that i wasn't exactly an angel too but if  it worked out for us even tho we were a lot worst than our kids why shouln't everything just go okay for them too? Honestly this is true but just because i didn't end up homeless or dead doesn't mean things couldn't have gone better, and i don't want to be a hypocrite but i don't want my kids to be doing this things, i want them to graduate from college and get good jobs, i don't want them to risk their time doing stupid shit like we did. My husbands instead doesn't agree and still has this ''fuck the system attitude'' and likes to brag about how he ended up doing whatever he wanted (has a tattoo shop) without going to college and that he lived his life 100% without dying or going to prison and stuff like that, he also hates the cops a lot and says that they kill black people, rape women and put drugs in people cars just to arrest them or that they steal your drugs and arrest you but then they do your drugs, calls them pigs and bastarda and even yell 'fuck the police' when he sees them and such things in front of our kids and i notice they repeat these kind of things and i don't want them to get in trouble.\nI'm worried because i want the best for my kids but i also love my husband and i know he loves our family a lot and he isn't doing all of this with bad intentions. How do you think i can make him understand that he is wrong? Also do you think i'm exagerating? Please give me some advices.\n(Sorry for english, i've been living in the usa for a lot of years but i still struggle on how to write some words)",

        "content": "Long story short, my teenage brother in law is about a decade younger than my husband. They are only half siblings, but they care for each other as full blood. Their mother is deceased, and the younger brother (I'll call him A) has been living with his biological father for close to 9 years up until this week. His biological father is a great person, but has an unhealthy obsession with a woman (his now second ex wife). This woman has left the biological father, but shows up for money, occasional sex and everything else under the sun. And she abuses A. A lot. And the father refuses to admit that it's happening. A was just coming over to our house for a few days a week, until this week. When he showed up on Monday, we went swimming at the local pool, and when he took his shirt off to go swimming, his rib cage was covered in bruises. We took him to the doctor, had X-rays taken and his ribs were cracked. A is 17, has never been allowed to play sports (abusive ex step mom), and hardly ever left his room at home. So, we went to his father. Showed his father, and we were told that he must have done it to himself, because ex wife is a goddess. My husband agrees that it had to have been the ex wife, because when he was 12 and A was 2, she gave my husband the same treatment to control him. \n\nSo we moved him out of the home, away from the abuser and into our own home. He started pouring out his whole life about how he's been abused since birth (I knew already, my husband was as well, but we didn't have physical proof till now). I get him calmed down, after about 6 hours of talking. \n\nHe has a hard time accepting things, taking social cues. Says he's bullied at school all the time. He lies about things because he wants to seem better at things than he actually is, he doesn't seem to have any real friends, but seems to have a lot of people his age that take advantage of him and steal stuff from him. He says he wants to be more fit, do better in school and have more friends. Says he's \"too stupid, fat and has a speech impediment, so he'd be better off just giving up forever.\" So he doesn't want to work for any of it, and it seems like that's because he's sure he's gonna fail. \n\nHe's started to have a nervous tick, where he pops his neck when he's anxious. I took him to the gym with me today and he kept trying to \"cheat\" (not timing his runs, or saying he did more weight reps than he actually did). \n\nI did an educational assessment (accelerated reader, 5th, 6th and 7th grade level basic math assessments, 5th, 6th, 7th grade science and reasoning questionnaire and a vocabulary test  for 6th-11th grade) He's averaging a 3rd grade reading level, 5th grade on math, 5th grade on science and 6th grade on vocabulary and spelling. \n\nHe was telling me about his high school career and how he's vandalized lockers and been in ISS and hit kids in his class because he's been bullied. \n\nI just don't know how to help him, where to start or where to go from here. We have financial resources, or we wouldn't have taken him in. But I don't know what resources exist to help, or who to talk to to look for a therapist, or tutoring. Or even how we can enroll him in school near us instead of in the school he was in (it has a graduating class of 14, and no guidance counselor, and I feel that was a huge factor in his bullying situation). \n\nDo any of you have experience with taking in this kind of teen? Or finding resources to help deal with behavioral and educational issues? Have you ever needed to help a teen play catchup to get on level footing with his peers?\n\nI guess I'm just kind of at a loss. He's 17, so he can decide to move without parental consent, but is that the extent of what he can do? Or can he make other decisions? And how do we go about getting that help?\n\nI'll take any advice you have. If there's a better place to put this, please let me know and I'll gladly take it elsewhere. Thank you!!",

(Because hes part of your family now and you want to work on things together, and no just send him to counselling like HES the problem) if hes been abused since birth its no surprise hes mentally/emotionally and socially behind. This will take a lot of love and affection and the right kind of attention to get through. But its worth it. Dont let him go back. Dont let her visit. And if the father continues to deny the abuse, maybe its best for him to be out of the picture too..., there is no way he actually didnt know all along.",

It is not uncommon for them to sit around the dinner table talking about their \"puberty\", as they say. Sex is starting to come up more and more as they get older. I tell them information as it comes up. \n In a few years I intend on buying a box on condoms and just putting them in the bathroom. My sister said I am crazy. She thinks it is giving them permission to have sex. I don't agree and will do what I please. It does make me wonder how this approach has worked for other parents though. Does my sister have a point? I know I would have appreciated some help when I was a teenager. I always had safe sex as a teen but I had to go through a lot of channels to make it possible.

        "content": "My original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/4bzlow/is_it_normal_for_a_14_year_old_girl_to_be/\n\nSo I spoke with my daughter again and I told her I had no problem with her having sex, as long she did it with FULL protection. I gave \"the talk\" about STDs and teen pregnancy, explained about condoms and have arranged for her to start taking the pill.\n\nSomething that really concerned me was that she had mutiple sex partners which the people in my original post alerted me about as being apparently very unusual My daughter has no boyfriend, she told me, only guys from school and guys she meets on her phone. I asked if her if she thought that was healthy and at first she insisted it was normal, but then confessed she didn't think having so many different partners was very good for her at all.\n\nSuddenly, tears and it all came pouring out. I was appalled. She was failing school. She was stupid. Everyone called her a slut. Her English teacher had given her a mean nickname. She was weird. Dad hadn't thought she was even worth hugging since she was 11. \nI didn't talk to her enough. We didn't care about her life. It just went on and on. I gave her the biggest hug I could and I didn't let go. I felt so ashamed. I told her I loved her.\n\nIt just seems like one problem was resolved (safe sex) but like other parents said in my last post's comments (and close friends I've spoken to) the multiple partners is a sign of something deeper. I feel like an awful parent right now, but I can't wallow in self-pity like this. I feel sort of helpless and need advice on how to proceed ASAP.",

        "content": "A long read but I need serious help on how to deal with preventing my sister from running away again.        \n    \nA little background: Our parents work in a different country so my sisters and I live with our grandparents. I\u2019m the guardian of my younger sisters since my grandparents are too old to take care of them 24/7. I work an 8-5 job so I\u2019m usually home at night when she\u2019s about to sleep so I don\u2019t get to spend as much time with her during the weekdays. My sisters are also very busy with school, so they aren\u2019t as home much. Either they\u2019re busy studying or they\u2019re out with friends.  \n\nMy youngest sister has never showed any signs of being a rebellious kid. She has good grades, has extra-curriculars in school, and has a balanced home life despite me being at work most of the day, and her sisters being busy with school.  We were never really sheltered but we know that with freedom, you have a great responsibility. We know normal etiquette such as letting people know where we are when we go out with friends or are stay out late. We always call or text family where we are, we always ask permission when we\u2019re planning a trip with some friends, and we always let them know what time we\u2019re coming home.\n\nThe problem started with her running away to a different city alone which is about 5 hours away from where we live. We\u2019re not exactly in a country where little girls can just go around leisurely at night and use public transportation. One day, she just went missing from our home and told nobody where she was going. She took her phone with her but was unreachable for almost 4 hours. By the 6th hour after we noticed she was missing, she contacted us saying not to worry because she\u2019s on her way home. She said she's on a bus home and she just came from a different city. Apparently, she just hopped on a bus and left. When saw all our messages and calls, she felt guilty and took the next bus home after a 4 hour journey. We got to pick her up a little after midnight from the bus stop and she was alone. We drove home and weren\u2019t angry at her. We just wanted to know why she left without telling any of us. She was slightly aggravated about us worrying about her and said she didn\u2019t want to tell anybody because she knew we wouldn\u2019t have let her go out alone. However, she told me something that scared me. She said, \u201cI just wanted an adventure.\u201d\nShe calculated everything she wanted to do in that city and said she was planning to run way from A WHOLE WEEK. She had a plan of just knocking around people\u2019s houses to see if she could find a family that would take her in for a week and had planned all the activities she wanted to do in that city. Take note, this is not her first time going to this city so it\u2019s not like she never experienced any of these activities before. We explained to her why she shouldn\u2019t just go away without telling anyone, especially since it\u2019s common here for people to take kidnap girls and sell them to sex/drug traffickers. She\u2019s lucky she didn\u2019t encounter any people who wanted to take advantage of her especially since she left just a little bit before nightfall. She apologised and seemed to understand that why that wasn\u2019t such a good idea. She apologised and was remorseful about it. \n\nA week or so later, she has 2 more incidents of running away to have an \u201cadventure\u201d, but this time, she actually sneaked out of school during school hours and even had elaborate plans as how she did it. The second time she ran away, she just left her bag at the entrance of the school and left. She went exploring a few blocks away from her school and came back at during dismissal to retrieve her things and went home as normal. She never told us what she did there for 7 hours. We only heard about this incident after the third time she ran away. The third time, I got a call from the principal informing my sister was missing. We only found her by chance when her school teachers were in line with her at the movie theater she snuck away to. Apparentlt, she convinced a classmate to be an accomplice so that she could sneak past the guards and visit a city 2 hours away from her school. From there she kept going from city to city and just did things she wanted to do like eat and watch movies or play games at the arcade. She was missing for a total of 9 hours that day and didn\u2019t seem to have an intention of turning back until she finished all the things she wanted to do.\n\nFor her, there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything wrong with what she\u2019s doing because she could be doing things that are worse like drinking alcohol, doing drugs etc. Her line of thinking is that her running away isn\u2019t as bad as we think. What\u2019s most worrying is that she doesn\u2019t seem to understand the gravity of her actions. The guard at the school might get fired over her sneaking out, her accomplice might get kicked out of school for lying to the school, but she really insists that the reason for all of this is for the adventure. She says she\u2019s bored by school and she\u2019s wasting her time there when she could be doing other worthwhile things like travelling, etc. She says she wants to experience life at the fullest and wants to savor every minute without any regret. Essentially, things that you would be doing once you have a steady supply of income and little to no responsibilities. We don\u2019t know where this is suddenly coming from because she has never showed any behaviour like this or anything that would make us suspect that she was unhappy or isn\u2019t adjusting well to school. \n\nHer high intelligence and manipulative behaviour is worrying. She really goes out of her way to scheme about how to run away from home including stealing money, lying to people, and involving accomplices to help her cover her tracks. Lately we\u2019ve been involving her with more activities when we go out with friends so she can have a different environment from home and school. We\u2019re also thinking about enrolling her in sports so she can have a different outlet. When we confronted her about her third offence, she seemed genuinely remorseful about her actions, but I can\u2019t help but feel like she might do this again in the future.  What should I do with this?\n\nTL;DR: 12 year old sister repeatedly runs away from home. She shows impulsive behaviour, steals, and lies to manipulate people to get what she wants. Need advice \n\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the replies! I appreciate your responses. I just wanted to address some points being made in the thread that I'm more concerned with:\n\n* We thought about enrolling her in certain activities she might be interested in, but she's not interested in supervision. She wants to do everything alone. We've reached a compromise and said we'd enrol her in a sport activity she likes but if she eventually gets bored with it, she might run away again. I want her to understand the gravity of her actions but talking alone won't help. She won't listen.\n\n* The scary part isn't the running away from home, it's her impulsiveness and behavior towards these situations. She goes to a school that is heavy on teaching correct morals and whatnot, which is why she thinks her actions aren't as bad as doing drugs, drinking alcohol, having sex, etc. She will do ANYTHING just so she gets what she wants. She's using her intelligence for bad things but she doesn't care. Again, talking or trying to involve her isn't helping. \n\n* The things she wants to do are things that we cannot be comfortable with her doing alone. It's like she's having a millenial college teen crisis already and is \"trying to find herself.\" I don't know how to make her understand that she can't get everything she wants at this time. My parents would like her to finish her education first and have her do these things during the weekends but she has other opinions about how she wants to live her life.",

It was an awful thing I did, and while I wish I had not deceived him, I don't regret it because it gave me my daughter, Krista. I met my partner a few months after Krista's birth, and we have been raising her together since. Krista's father has had little contact with her.\n\nDuring her childhood, Krista would get bullied and harassed, along with us. I always encouraged her to try to make friends, and we even joined a LGBT+ support group for families. Krista still never quite made any lasting friendships.\n\nIn her teens, Krista became more rebellious. While she certainly isn't homophobic, we often had a lot of fights because I always tried to encourage her to experiment with both genders and to keep an open mind when it comes to sex. She told me that she always felt a lot of pressure to \"become gay\". I won't lie. I would prefer my daughter be a lesbian like us, although I would still accept her no matter what!\n\nNow she is 18, and preparing to enter her first semester of college in September of this year. Krista has informed my partner and I that she wants nothing to do with us after that. My partner shot back that we would not support her financially if that were the case. Krista got in a huge argument with her, and claims that she doesn't care, and will try to put herself through school. \n\nAfter that, I went to talk to her. Krista told me that she feels alienated and that she feels that we pressure her too much, and \"shove the gay shit in [her] face\". I was very offended by that, and we ended up in a screaming match too....\n\nI have no idea what to do about this. I don't think she meant that, at least not the way she said it.

        "content": "I don't even know if this is the right sub.  But here goes...\n\nI've been going out with a lady I met in July 2015 and I'm absolutely crazy about her.  She has two teen daughters, 13 and 14.  I've known for a few months that I want to marry her and we've talked about marriage.\n\nI'm pretty sure her 13 year old has Aspergers, which isn't a deal breaker.  Her 14 year old however, I think may be too much of a strain.\n\nMy girlfriend has been a single mom for quite a while and makes shit money.  The dad has never held a job for more than a month and just couch surfs so he's completely out of the picture.  She lives in a one bedroom apartment with both of the girls.  She works 40 hrs a week to provide for them, but they both have behavioral issues that make it near impossible to trust them alone.\n\nThe 13 year old is childlike, but can be handled for the most part.  The 14 year old will invite strange men over that she meets in chatrooms and has sex with them.  Her mom has restricted her internet/phone access, but she finds ways around it.  She's stolen my daughter's IPod to access the internet and solicit men over 18, asked people for marijuana, and a bunch of other stuff.\n\nShe's extremely verbally and physically abusive to her mom and sister.  Any little slight can set her off.  She can ask to use the phone, and if mom says no, she comes out swinging.  When she skips school and doesn't come home until midnight, high and partied out, she'll either get in a fist fight with mom or threaten to kill herself.  She took 12 tylenol once so she had to be put in a psych ward for a week.  I don't think she wants to kill herself, but she'll make it look that way to get mom to let her do what she wants.  At my house, she wanted her sister's tablet to get on the internet.  She fought to get it and shoved her sister so hard that she's broken some cabinets.  She says horrible things like she wants to slit her sister's throat.  When I called her out on accessing my computer to seek out men, she had a meltdown.  She tore out her hair and threw herself on the ground.  She went on a tirade saying her mom shouldn't be with me and accused her mom of being a 'bed-hopper' throughout the years.  She was caught bringing a knife to school, which got her two weeks is jail.  Two weeks after she got out, she got in a fight with her mom and punched her in the face and kicked her legs so bad they bruised.  This wasn't the first time either.\n\nA couple of months ago, she was invited to a sleepover.  Early the next morning, the parents called us saying she had bragged to her friends at the sleepover about all her sexual exploits with older men down to the details and all her experiences with drugs.\n\nThere are some state-mandated counseling sessions where they send a counselor to the house and discuss goals and a bunch of other stuff, but it's about as effective as stopping a war by making the aggressor listen to folk music.  She walks out of these sessions half the time and sometimes doesn't even show up.  Now her mom has to deliver her to the counselor, but has to miss work to do it.\n\nI really love her mom.  I want to marry her.  But I also do not want that girl in my house.  I know she'll go through anything unlocked, steal anything she wants, invite strangers into my house and expose the family to all the inherent dangers, and eventually she'll turn violent against me or my daughter (24).  I'm surprised she hasn't gotten violent with me yet.  I'm especially afraid that I'd marry her mom, we'd all move in together, she gets violent with me and then I'd have to knock her hard on her ass.  How could a new marriage survive?\n\nMy question is:  Have any of you seen a child like this turn good?  Should I press my girlfriend to get her put in some group home?  Should I wait 4 years to marry her so I can refuse to house her daughter?",

She is very attention seeking and very non discerning about where the attention comes from. If anyone likes her, she likes them - both female and male friends. She has no real sense of self and no self confidence. \n\nPhysically she has gone through puberty and has a woman's body and she uses her body to get attention. Mentally and emotionally she is very immature and her social skills are limited but she has learned to just stay quiet, bat her eyelids, open her shirt up and smile and she gets lots of attention. Other teens seem to tire of her fairly quickly as I don't think she brings much to the friendship - she doesn't really express any interest in them, it is all very superficial. She makes very impulsive poor decisions all based on getting other people to like her or doing what others want to do. She gets along better with 10-11 yr olds. \n\nThe issue is that she has a new boyfriend, again he expressed interest so she fell for him. He seems like a nice enough kid but I have no doubt if he said - \"do you want to have sex?\" she would say okay without a second thought. Same thing if he said do you want to drink? do drugs? go with a drunk driver? - anything. This is kind of her first \"real\" boyfriend and I am having a hard time figuring out where to draw the line. She is madly in love with this boy and would spend 24/7 with him if she could. Thankfully they don't attend the same school. I don't trust her at all - not because she is a bad kid but because she has no boundaries and makes impulsive poor decisions. However I also can't lock her up. So far they have only been able to spend time together if he comes over so I can keep an eye on what they are doing but I can't control what she does at school and she is pushing to do activities with him as he doesn't want to just come over - they want to go to the movies or go play laser tag or go hang out at his house. \n\nShe is also now asking to go out for Hallowe'en with him and another 2 friends (also a couple). I have no doubt the instant I am out of sight, they will split off and do who knows what. For the record, the boy has not done anything at this point that I can tell that would give me cause for worry but I don't know him and I can't trust her - I wouldn't be surprised if she was the aggressor / pushing him to do things.

        "title": "Almost teenage son is very 'childlike' Worried it may affect him later on.",
        "content": "TL;DR - My son is in highschool and favours teddies over video games. Kids shows over comedy, pajamas over jeans and his books over friends, worried it may be affecting him at school as he has no significant friends and I'm concerned he may be bullied for his interests. Want to know if I'm over-reacting..\n\nToday I'm asking about my son, he's 12 and turns 13 in just a week, he's just started year 8. The thing I'm noticing is he's very... Childlike. \n\nI'm not saying this in a bad or negative way necessarily, I'm just worrying about any potential bullying issues that may arise with him being in highschool. He has had a few teasing issues in year 7 but I feel like year 8 is really when kids start to turn into teenagers/young adults.\n\nHe sleeps with a teddy in patterned pajamas, he moves the food on his plate around into shapes, and he watches 'Pre teen' shows on Disney. While other kids are getting into family guy and big bang theory. \n\nHe likes his bedroom to keep his cartoony space theme. We asked him if he'd like his room redecorated over Christmas as a present but he's adamant on keeping the same planet wallpaper he's had since he was 7. \n\nAnother Christmas thing I noticed. A friend of mine has a son his age too, and when we were discussing what they may want for Christmas (I know I'm Planning early but I find it easier to spread the cost) \nHer son had asked for an xbox and the new fifa game and my son... Asked for yet more lego and a robotic dinosaur he'd seen on TV. \n\nI have nothing against him building with lego, and some of his structures are fairly impressive, in an attempt to possibly get him into more 'grown up' things I listed a few to him, when I brought up maybe buying a ps4 or xbox his younger brother said that he'd love one. I'm thinking about  maybe buying it as a 'Joint gift' to try and get him to play it. \n\nOn regular occasions my far younger son has thrown out something for being 'too babyish' that my older soon gladly accepted. And his room cupboard is filled with more toys than his brothers. \n\nHe comes home and goes to his room and plays on the computer. He doesn't really show any attraction towards social media. He plays on house design software and messes on whatever Microsoft program he's learnt about that week at school. He's actually doing really really well in his maths science and it at school, so I've embraced that side too. \n\nThe other day after getting a letter that he had been having his sex ed lessons expand into more intimate and adult topics I asked him if he liked any of the girls or boys at school and he just shrugged and said he didn't feel anything towards anyone. \n\nHe's embarassed about the 'childish' things he enjoys. Out in the supermarket he was wearing a Tshirt featuring a smiling flower on it and covered it with his coat in a hurry when he saw a girl from his school. \n\nHe doesn't talk about having any friends at school specifically, and I'm worried that maybe he's finding making friends difficult because of his interests. His brother plays football in a small club that my husband takes him to, and he stays home on a Sunday and bakes with me instead. \n\nI'm asking because I'm worried that maybe I'm influencing him by embracing the things he likes. I stopped trying to make him wear \"Grown up\" clothes a while ago, but I'm concerned I may have 'Babied' him a little too much. I'd wrap him and my other son in bubble wrap if I could. He's always been a quiet kid and was never any trouble but I'm worried this may be a sign of something developmental. \n\nTell me if I'm overreacting reddit or if I should step in? Does anyone else have any issues with this? I'm not really complaining and I'd secretly like my little boys to stay my little boys forever, but I can't help feel like I'm doing something wrong...\n\nAdvice?",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Boys mature slower than girls. He hasn't hit puberty yet. While his interests are childish, he has shown being self-conscious by covering up his shirt in front of a girl. I really don't think there's any cause for concern yet. He's not interested in sports, and that's okay. He's not interested in video games, count yourself lucky. He has imagination, he's more hands on it seems, engineering definitely looks like a future path for him! Encourage those interests rather then the sports, video games and typical teenage boy interests. He doesnt need them, and it sounds like you are more concerned with him being 'normal' and 'like his brother'. Pushing him into adulthood and more typical interests is only going to backfire and make him feel isolated and singled out. Embrace that you don't have teenage drama and angst yet and that he's forging his own path. If he continues with the legos, and the house designer and cooking and his programs, he's on path to become a very self-reliant and successful adult.",

Last night he told me something that I really need advise on how to handle.\n\nApparently he had sex for the first time yesterday after school in the school bath room.  He said that a friend gave him some condoms, (which he says he used) a few weeks ago, and him and a girl that he is friends with talked about it and decided to give it a try.  I know that doesn't sound right, but that's how he said it went down.  Not a spur of the moment thing, but something they planned and talked about for a few weeks.  As far as I know they are not even boyfriend and girlfriend, just friends who decided to in his words \"experiment\".  He claims their was actual penetration, that he did use a condom and that it didn't last long.\n\nMy reaction was pretty much one of disappointment and utter shock.  I'm pretty sure he didn't consider any of the possible consequences of what he did before hand, and seemed terrified once I laid out all the ways this could have and still could go wrong.  I made him promise not to do anything like this again any time soon, and especially not at school, and that I had to think about how to respond to this and to give me some time.  I didn't punish him or yell or anything, just sat in stunned silence as he told me what happened, then explained how stupid it was and what could happen.\n\nSo this morning he gets up and tells me it was all a joke, just to see how I would react, but I don't buy that.  Ya there are some holes in his story, but he was genuinely scared last night so SOMETHING happened, and I actually think what he told me last night might be close to the truth.\n\nHe's a pretty good kid, who gets A's and B's in school, plays sports and lives on his computer when at home. He has been 0 trouble before except for the usual teen stuff about being lazy and not wanting to do chores.  He's kinda nerdy and I swear I didn't think I would be dealing with this kind of thing for at least a few more years.  \n\nPlease reddit, help me figure out how to handle this.  I haven't told his mom yet, because she's not nearly as open minded about sex, and would really really blow this up, want to call the school, the girls parents and everything.  I have to keep this under wraps with her at least until I figure out what actually happened and how to handle it.",

        "title": "My Wife and I are in an FLR, and have a surprise pregnancy. Unsure on how our relationship works with child rearing.",
        "content": "First, for the unaware, an FLR is a \"Female Led Relationship.\"  In the context of a my wife and I's relationship, it means that she is the decision maker in all manners and the ultimate authority and head of the house.  For the most part our relationship is pretty typical, we attend events and family functions, we go out on date nights, we stay in and watch Netflix, we have usually vanilla (and sometimes kinky sex).\n\nOur relationship is born out of the concept that women in general, but especially my wife, are better decision makers who see the whole situation and can better take into account the emotional and interpersonal ripple effects that every decision (large and small) may make.  It's not a \"female superiority\" out there fetish thing, where we believe men are insects and women Goddesses... nothing like that, despite what many fetish-oriented people who also have FLR's might lead you to believe.\n\nWhat it means is that when it comes time for decisions, what she says goes and I trust in her to make the right decision in all matters.  I know she values my input and I hold a good deal of sway over the final decision, but that final decision does always rest with her.  This is intentionally done and a conscious decision, we both enjoy her having the final say.  She likes to lead and decide, and I like having someone to trust in to make the decisions; I find it comforting to have higher authority than myself in the relationship.\n\nWe've been together for 4 years and married for one.  I have 6 nieces and 2 nephews on my side and 3 nieces and 3 nephews on her side.  We have a lot of kids in our lives, ranging from a few months old to the mid-teens.  So we decided early on in the relationship we didn't really need nor want to have kids of our own.  We both love kids, but we also love our alone time, couple time, ability to vacation, etc.  \n\nDespite birth control (she was on the pill, and I usually pulled out), my wife is now 3 months pregnant with our \"oops baby\".  After some discussion on whether or not we should abort the pregnancy my wife decided that we would keep the baby and raise a boy or girl of our own.  While all decisions are hers to make, this one was *definitely* hers to make and I would have been happy of accepting of either decision.  In half a year or so I'll be a father, and that's pretty cool.\n\nSo here's where we are and why I'm posting:\n\nMy wife and I haven't had the conversation on how we will raise our child yet.  We don't really share with family and friends our mutual agreement that women are superior leaders and decision makers and that men work better with a woman in a higher position of authority above them.  Most our friends and family are somewhat aware of the fact that I run all decisions through my wife and she calls the shots, but it's not an outspoken thing.  We really don't talk about it in public and it's not like we're political advocates going around making demonstrations or anything.  It's just a belief we both have.\n\nI'm very nervous about raising a child with our beliefs because even though I \"know\" them to be true I want our child to be an individual who makes up his or her own mind on the matter.  I don't want my potential son to feel like he has to submit to the authority of women, and I don't want my potential daughter to feel like she has to command men in her relationships.\n\nYet I also don't want to give up or hide what I love and share with my wife in our own household.  Especially not from our own child.  We are who we are, and we shouldn't have to hide who we are at home.  I love my wife and love her being my leader and the decision maker over me.  I never want to lose that.\n\nI'm unsure of how to balance that.  How do you balance raising your kid to be their own person without sacrificing your own beliefs?\n\nWhat I'm looking for here is general thoughts on raising kids with all of the above in mind before my wife and I have the conversation on how much of our relationship to have revealed and exposed for our child to see.  And just thoughts in general would be great.\n\nSorry if this was a bit long-winded, wanted to fully lay out where I was coming from.  All replies, input, questions, and advice welcomed!",

        "title": "I kind of don't want my son to go to college... (actually kind of a rant I guess)",
        "content": "I would like to preface this with the fact that my son is 2, and this is a decision that won't be made for many years to come. Also, my husband and I basically agree on this, so it isn't like it is a fight or anything.\n\nI recently had a co-worker give me endless hell for this, so I thought I would put it out there and see what other people think.\n\nI did not go to college. In fact, the last grade I completed was 9th (after the second time around) and I got my GED when I was 19. This was due to several outside factors, such as my parents going through a divorce and living in two separate towns, and kind of fighting over me because I was the youngest (of 5) and the only one who was considered a dependent. They also went back and forth on \"homeschooling\" me, so I was in and out of school for a couple of years hence the 9th grade twice. My late teens and early twenties were spent exploring what it meant to be a young adult, experiencing love and loss, doing random weird things, making friends, and just... living. I worked various jobs, visited Canada to see my then BF (now ex), worked on my mom's ranch, and so on.\n\nMy husband went to college but never graduated. He started out strong, but eventually he found that the reasons he wanted to go to college weren't actually what he wanted. He is still several thousand dollars in debt, and we have to file our taxes a special way every year so they only take HIS return to pay it back and not mine. He was going to school for engineering, and then for programming, and then for something else.  He is a math geek, and he loves his computers. (very useful when my stuff breaks, lol).\n\nWe both work at the same company (though not in the same department obviously) and we basically make the same amount of money and it is enough for us to live comfortably. (sometimes  actually I make more than him.)\n\nI see so many jobs that require a degree, and I try to think about what kind of experience do people who went to college have that I don't.  A lot of (but not all!!) of the stories I hear about college involve sex, drugs, TONS of alcohol, partying, barely passing courses, sleeping through lectures, and still making a high enough grade to get that degree. It sounds to me like these people didn't actually want to go to learn anything, they just wanted the piece of paper that might let them get a better job.\n\nBut how many people complain that they just got out of college and can't find work in their field?  How many people get chosen for a job because they have a degree, but the degree has nothing to do with what their job requires?\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I am NOT saying that college isn't worth it, and that people who have degrees didn't earn them.  I know several people who made good grades, learned what they wanted, and are working jobs that makes them happy. And I think that is awesome.\n\nI guess what really bothers me is the mentality that you HAVE to go to college right out of high school. I personally can't imagine the pressure that you would be under to choose what you want for the rest of your life when you aren't even adult enough to own a gun or drink a beer.  I suppose it is easier to get into the learning rhythm right after high school, but so many people who go to college don't even know what they want to do. So they just party and drink. Those who DO actually want to learn and get into the fields that make them happy wind up massively in debt, and probably won't be done paying off their student loans until their OWN kids are in college.\n\nI am more than happy to set money aside for my son so that when he is ready to make that choice, he can.  But I am not going to force him to go to college. I think what I want most for him is to really decide what he wants out of life, and then choose to go to school, if it is necessary. He can use the money to get himself a house, or a car, or go backpacking across Europe if that is what he wants.  I am not going to be disappointed in him if he doesn't go to college.\n\nI just want him to be happy.",

        "content": "We need help. Please read it all.\n\nMy 33-year-old sister passed away this summer. She died very unexpectedly. With no father in the picture, her two girls are now living with their grandma (my mother). Lets call my nieces \"C\" and \"M\". C is 6 years old, and M just turned 14. They moved from an apartment in Minneapolis to a house in a very, very small town in Wisconsin. I go to school in a town about 30 minutes away from them.\n\nI'm worried about M. She's failing nearly all of her classes in her new school, and instead is focused on popularity. My mom tries to stay on top of her about school work, asking her what she has due/what she needs to study for/etc., but M lies to her about it. Her first report card from this year was bad (A few F's, and some C's and D's), but she just received her second report card and it's even worse. She's failing most of her classes. The report card says that she has incomplete work even though she's telling my mom that she's doing everything she needs to do. She lies to my mom, and always wants to go out with her friends. She's going to end up repeating the 8th grade if she keeps things going this way.\n\nOn top of that, my mom's very concerned about her popularity around town, particularly with the boys. According to what my mom is telling me, she is attracting a lot of the small-town boys, and is loving the attention. She has started to dress more provocatively and wearing makeup. When she goes out to her friends' houses, or to the football games, my mom has no control over what she's doing. For all we know, she's lying about where she's going. On top of lying, she has also become very moody and argumentative. (Typical teenager stuff I guess.)\n\nM has had several \"boyfriends\" since she's moved here. My mom is very worried that she's attracting the attention of older boys (16 and 17), and that she'll get pregnant. My mom is hesitant to put M on birth control, because she's worried that it'll encourage her to go out and have sex. For the record, I'm all for getting her on birth control, because if it's going to happen, I'd rather have her protected. The last thing we need is a teen pregnancy.\n\nWe don't know what to do about this. My mom wants to take away M's phone and limit (if not cut off completely) her social activities until she starts to show improvement in school. But I worry that doing that will only push her further in the wrong direction. (Maybe she'll start sneaking out or learn to lie better.) Of course, I understand that she's going through a difficult time in her life. Her mother just died, and she had to move to a completely new place. But I'm worried that she's heading down a bad path. \n\nM really really looks up to me, so I've tried talking to her about her school work. (I try to be approachable and open with her so she feels comfortable talking with me. I try to relate to her and encourage her to work harder. I've given her study advice and offered to help tutor her.) I only recently became aware of her boy trouble, so I haven't had a chance to talk to her about it yet. I think it's important for me to be directly involved in this. She's always looked up to me, and has always wanted to be just like me. I'm young enough to be approachable with these kind of issues (I'm 22), and we've always been close. What should I say to her? What should my mother do about it?",

        "content": "Original post: http://redd.it/2jeiwt\n\nDaughter is finally talking. When I said that she will have to go to the teen center and talk to a doctor she told me she doesn't want to do that. I then said she will have to talk to me if she doesn't do that so she did a few days later. Apparently the boy is her boyfriend but she broke up with him after I caught them. The reason being that she was angry with him for initiating sex in the dance hall where they might get caught. When they did get caught she blamed him. This explains why she said he wasn't her boyfriend and why he wasn't sure when I asked. Now they are back together and she says she does want to have sex with him and he hasn't pressured her. She says that they have used condoms and that she doesn't want any other kind of birth control because condoms work just fine for them. She doesn't want to see a doctor or get checked because they have used condoms besides she says the boy was a virgin which seems likely given their age. She said okay when I asked to buy condoms and said I can put them in her room when she isn't there so she doesn't have to see me do it. I also asked what she would do in case of an accidental pregnancy and she said abortion. She asked me if I was done asking her questions and if I could promise to never bring this up again. I told her she can come to me if she changes her mind and wants more permanent birth control so I can book her an appointment.\n\nI am proud of her for having this talk with me. It was obvious that she was very embarrassed and really putting in effort to do it. I am no longer worried about her getting pregnant and sleep better at night. Does it seem reasonable that I let this go now or is there anything else I should do?

She would be normal nice lady most of the time, but would have these intense rages a couple of times a week - her face goes pale and her eyes go blank and she just starts screaming and hitting and throwing things. I've seen it since. It's like she can't control herself. He would try to calm her down and hold her back or he would run away until it passed. Things were ok in between, so he stuck it out for a while. One night it got really bad and he called the police because she was hurting him and he was having to really hold her back. When the police got there she cried and said he hurt her and showed the bruises on her wrists and they arrested him. He got a couple years probation and during that time her rages turned into this constant taunting - do the dishes or I'll have you arrested. I'll have you put away any time I want. Etc. He managed to get some recordings of this. He tried to leave once and she had him arrested. It was dropped immediately but he was scared to leave. He eventually just started an affair and she kicked him out. He immediately filed for divorce. This was about when Son was 11 months old. She kept Son away from him mostly for the next eight months as the divorce was finalized.\n\nHe was fully screwed in the custody of course, with a progressive schedule that started as supervised visits but has been overnights (three days) in our home every other weekend for the past year or so. Son is 3.5 now.\n\nWe had originally figured we would just comply with the custody schedule perfectly for some time, act as nice to Crazy-face as possible, and then move to try and get some more time, something closer to 50/50 parenting time. It was brutal the whole time - she would call screaming eleven time in one night about a toy left in the truck and stuff like that. She would threaten to not let us see him unless we sent her extra money for the month. She attacked us on custody exchanges and chased us with her car once. The $500 a month we send her has been her only source of income this entire time. She was mean and crazy and would randomly attack us sometimes and just generally hates us and tries to make our lives hell, but we just plugged along. We kept a thorough custody journal and only communicated through text and email.\n\nCrazy face has known that we'd be asking for more parenting time this year. We naively thought we could just try to get along with her and she'd eventually work with us to make things easier and more fair. She acted reasonably more than half the time.\n\nSo, this spring, right as we were ready to file, shit hit the fan. We were looking at pictures of Son on her instagram, as we did from time to time, just to see him, when we found a link to teen-daughter's instagram, which linked us to her twitter, which linked us to her blog. It was INSANE. The kid is messed up and dark. 17 years old, on every drug known to man, anorexic and posting all this \"pro-anorexia\" stuff, and, worst of all, posting on and on about how her mom beats the crap out of her. It seemed to have started right after my husband got out and we found six separate posts about abuse over the course of the last year. It was hard, because the kid posts like 20 times a day, but we spent days weeding through the whole thing. Dozens of pictures of her using drugs and smoking cigs in the house. Talk of her trading ecstasy for chores with her 15 year old brother. Really nasty and graphic pictures of her cutting herself like HUNDREDS of times, covered in blood. Posts where she puts up nude pics of herself and requests that someone come over and \"f*ck\" her because she's bored and horny.\n\nShe also bitches a lot about having to \"watch my bitchy baby brother for three fucking days straight\" and stuff like that.\n\nWe screenshot hundreds of things and then made a little sampling and sent it right off to CPS. A report was opened and they went and interviewed them all and interviewed us and then dismissed it. The blog had ended a few months before, after daughter had complained on it about it \"getting around school,\" and the CPS worker said that teen-daughter said that all of that behavior had ended and that the posts about her mom beating her up had just been because she was mad at her mom. And that was that.\n\nSo, we decided it was time to sue for FULL custody and we got a lawyer, in March. Just after that, in later March (the day before our wedding,) we got a strange and sudden email from Crazy-face, saying \"Son might have autism.\" We called the place that she said told her this - they said that they hadn't given any autism diagnosis and that she must have misunderstood them - they were just going to do a screening and no, it turns out no autism. But they also mentioned that Son was referred there by a counselor.\n\nSo we contacted this counselor, whom we'd never heard of. After quite the series of contacts in order to get them to believe my husband was who he said he was and some really clear reluctance on their part, they sent us Son's file. IT WAS SHOCKING. Crazyface had been taking him there for five months without telling us, which to start off with, was a clear violation of the custody agreement. Secondly, what she was reporting there was SCARY. She said that from the time Son starting visiting us he had \"turned a 180.\" Said he was having violent meltdowns multiple times a day, extreme sexual behaviors including taking off his clothes and saying \"put the penis in your moth, it's ok.\" He had started hurting animals and he was having night terrors every night. Now, we were reading this in March and she had started reporting it in November and we have NEVER seen anything like this from him. We were a little scared that he might be having a miserable time at mom's and maybe someone was hurting him, but we were mostly sure that she was trying to build an abuse case against us and simply false reporting to the therapist, since the therapist wasn't witnessing any of this.\n\nShe also told the therapist that my husband was a super scary abuser. She told the therapist that Son was originally a twin but that husband had beat her and caused her to miscarry twin. We spent the next two months trying to meet with the therapist, emailing the therapist, calling the therapist. She refused to speak with us or meet with us this entire time. We're the monsters.\n\nSo, we had a friend come over that night when we received the file, who is a professional in early childhood stuff and go over the files with us. She was equally shocked, as she knows Son well too and had never seen any of this, but agreed with us that it was likely made up and advised up to call CPS in case it wasn't. So, off again to the child welfare folk, same outcome as before - nothing going on. We weren't surprise. As I said before, Crazy-face just has outbursts once or twice a week. She is a pretty nice and relatively sane lady most of the time, and I really do believe that she loves Son and dotes on him and is attentive when she can be. We have never argued that that's not the fact. We just think she is unstable, can't support him well, and has some seriously questionable judgement about not only who is appropriate to be caring for a 2 year old (drug addled teens?) but some pretty bad morals around manipulating and lying to get by rather than working.\n\nWe wired our entire house with cameras and recorded every second of every visit since, without telling Crazy-face. She continued reporting the same stuff, while we continued recording the peace at our house. We figured we were set.\n\nSo a few months ago we hired the \"best custody evaluator\" we could find. Our case seemed perfect for a custody evaluation. We are two successful professionals with college educations living very happy wholesome healthy lives and we have this HUGE amount of evidence of Crazy-face being crazy and the home life there being dangerous, even beyond the fact that she is a hippy who hasn't worked in twenty years and lives off the system in a pisshole in the middle of nowhere. Custody evaluator seemed to love us and even implied to us that he thought Crazy-face was crazy. Crazy-face told him CRAZY stuff. She told him that my husband secretly has sex with his own mom and that he lives a double life and that husband had this lengthy convoluted plan to steal her land away (which she doesn't own) and had knocked her up on purpose.\n\nWe had it nailed.\n\nBut then we got the evaluator's report last week. He said that both parents are adequate parents and therefore he sees no reason for a change of custody. He found for her. We are SHOCKED and DEVASTATED. He screwed it u. We are positive of that. He said, \"As I prefer to not use computers, I did not watch the surveillance videos. However, I can easily make the assumption that the child behaves reasonably the same in both homes. I believe the mother has proven that she tends to exaggerate and I can presume that father is simply under reporting. The child's negative and unhealthy behaviors are clearly a result of a very high conflict relationship that is continuing, but not the result of either parent's direct action. I believe that neither parent directly harms the child and since the child clearly has a stronger attachment to his mother, I see no cause for him to change homes.\"\n\nHe's wrong. We aren't under reporting shit. The kid has NO night terrors here. NO violent outbursts. He has NEVER stripped naked. These are binary yes/no's. His assumption screwed us. And there is apparently NOTHING we can do about it. The truth is, mother is lying or child is suffering at her home and not ours. One or the other.\n\nHe also agreed that there are \"some concerns\" about Crazy-face's behavior towards us, but that since they don't \"harm the child,\" it really has no standing in this case. It's not illegal for her to be mean to us.\n\nWe are tapped financially. We have sold everything we own to come up with the 30 grand this has cost us so far. We are less than two weeks from court. We are going to lose. We are going to fight and fight. Our lawyer is going to pound on the fact that the evaluator IGNORED the actual evidence, but we're still going to lose. Out of the 13 judges we may be assigned, only one has ANY serious family law experience and the rest are only going to be comfortable going with the expert. Why would they listen to 10 hours of testimony and go against a 30 years expert who's been investigating us for 6 weeks, at our own request?\n\nSo. Does anyone have any ideas? Has anyone ever heard of anything like this?\n\nOh, there's also the fun part where she's let us know that if we go ahead with this and take her to court, then her teenagers will be taking the stand to say that my husband sexually abused them (this has never been reported before.)\n\nIf we just walk away though, she will make our lives a living hell for the next decade. When the evaluator gave his report, she actually started gloating and taunting right there in front of the evaluator and lawyers. Eeeeevil.\n\nAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "/r/legaladvice might be able to help in some way. I think that your lawyer should request that the \"expert\" be required to review all of the footage with a witness present as he is ignoring evidence that directly contradicts his report and will influence his recommendation.

        "title": "I need some advice from fellow parents regarding my daughters dad. Please?",
        "content": "Reddit, I need advice from other parents because I don\u2019t know what choice to make.\nSorry for the wall of text, but I think having the full background will be beneficial. \t\n\n10+ years ago, I got pregnant and gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. I and my boyfriend (at the time) were VERY young. We were teenagers who grew up in semi broken homes. Before the pregnancy both of us were just reckless teens who were trying to live the \u201csex, drugs and roc n roll\u201d dream. However, I got pregnant before we ever did anything too stupid. \nOnce we found out that I was pregnant, my whole world changed. I went back to school and did things the way I thought I was supposed to. We broke up soon after her birth, but I thought he could still handle being a part of her life. I was wrong. I found a part time job and finished high school. He dropped out, stopped returning my calls and wouldn\u2019t visit his daughter. All I wanted was help with paying for stuff and a babysitter, sometimes. He never did that. He would spend an hour here or there with her and then claim he was going to be back the next day. Then he wouldn\u2019t show up until the next week or so. I put up with this for the first 2 years. Eventually, I gave up on trying forcing their relationship. I wouldn\u2019t call him, I just gave him free range to come and go as he pleased. Again, he\u2019s tell her that he would be back the next day (or something similar) and not come around for weeks. I felt terrible for her. A 3 year old knows when daddy hasn\u2019t been around in a while. \nAnyway, eventually he went months without contacting us. I found out through \u201cfriends\u201d that he picked up a nasty **heroin** habit. I knew he was smoking weed; we both did before I got pregnant. Heroin? No way. I thought there was no way i was going to get involved in this, nor let my daughter be around him. He eventually contacted me about seeing her, and I told him no. (Before anyone assumes that I wasn\u2019t \u201csure\u201d of his drug problems, I want to say that I actually knew. It wasn\u2019t gossip. There was a small group of kids doing it at the time, one of our old friends died from it. His parent\u2019s knew. He\u2019d admit to it)\n\nOver the next few years, I graduated high school, started college and found a decent paying job. We live in a nice apartment with my SO, who is currently working on a masters degree. We both have steady jobs and a steady home life. My daughter goes to bed on time, has manners, and cleans up after herself... all that good stuff. \n\nHowever, my ex had many run-ins with the law. Went to jail, prison, did probation and parole. Many times. He got sober and went back to drugs several times. \n\nMy problem now: My kid is 10 years old and her \u201cdad\u201d contacted me via facebook asking to see her. He\u2019s claimed that he\u2019s clean now, got a job and is going to pay child support.\n I\u2019ve been in contact with his family a lot, and I know that he\u2019s been clean for less than a year. I\u2019ve known what he\u2019s been doing all of these years due to his family and social networks. I do believe that he\u2019s clean. I know where he got a job. But should I care?\nI\u2019ve spent my entire youth being the responsible one. In her entire life, he\u2019s spent less than 24 hrs total with her, and maybe $60 in child support. \nSo, Reddit parents, what would you do?\n\nI'm scared that it'll rock her little world. That she'll have issues from it, if he screws up again. \nBut he sends me messages everyday asking if he can see her and saying that he's changed. \n\nWhat do i do?",

        "title": "15 year old daughter won't compromise",
        "content": "I am the mother of four children. Three girls ages 19, 17 and 15. One boy aged 13. The 15 year old is adopted and the other three are my biological children. Let's call the 15 year old Alice. Alice's parents were French and had a wine farm in California. They died in a car crash when Alice was an infant. Alice had no relatives in the states so she came to live with us as we were friends with her parents. \n\nI have raised my children much like the way I was raised and it works well with all my biological children, but not with Alice. Alice has always been very stubborn. Already in kindergarden she refused to go out if she couldnt wear a particular hat and so on. I didnt think much of it then. When she was about 12 I got her an Iphone and laid down the rules which I have with all my children: no naked pics, no sexting, and I can look through their phone to check. Alice then refused to accept the phone. I thought she'd come around but she is now 15 and still doesn't have a cell phone. Same thing happened when I got her a laptop. She wouldn't accept it after I laid down the rules. As a result Alice is the only one of my kids with no phone or laptop. \n\nIt doesn't stop there. My two older girls started going to parties in high school and I gave them a curfew, they complained a little, but accepted. Alice asked me if she could go to a party and I gave her a curfew (midnight) and she said she wouldn't go then. I asked her why and she replied \"I don't like the feeling of being babied.\" I said \"But you will miss out on all the fun with your friends if you don't go.\" She said \"They are only aquantancies and they aren't that fun. Not worth the feeling of being babied.\" \n\nI don't think Alice has (m)any friends. I suppose it is difficult for her when she doesnt have a cell phone or laptop and doesnt go to parties. Usually she will sit in her room and read books or write. She rarely lets me read anything she has written. One time when I was worried about Alice I read something she'd left on her desk. It contained a detailed sex scene so I felt I had to ask Alice about it after apologizing for reading her writing. Alice wasnt too upset and said she shouldnt have left her writing on her desk, but she refused to tell me how she knew anything about sex. The next day she bought a lock which she put on a drawer and now she keeps her writing in that drawer. I went through the books on her shelves and found 50 shades of gray, which I didnt know she had. I assume that's where she learned about sex details and if I had known I wouldnt have let her read it. \n\nBoth my other girls are very open with me and tell me about all the high school drama, but Alice doesn't. This summer she started going to the park a lot (daytime). We live in a small town and everyone knows the park belongs to the outcast kids. I asked Alice what she does in the park and she replied \"Gathering writing material.\" When she came home one day I looked in her pursue (I was looking for a sunblock chapstick I thought she might have) and found an opened condom wrapper. I confronted Alice who said she didnt want to talk about it. I asked Alice if she was having sex and Alice replied \"That is private.\" I am sad and upset that Alice wont talk to me. If she is having sex I wont be mad. My other two girls started having sex with their boyfriends at 14 and 16 respectively which I allowed after meeting the boys. I am worried about Alice because I dont know the kids at the park. When I asked if she has a boyfriend she replied \"no\" and when I asked if she has a crush on someone she replied \"There are no interesting boys in this town.\" I have grounded Alice from the park until she tells me the story behind the condom wrapper. \n\nAll Alice does when grounded from the park is sit in her room and read books. I asked Alice why she is always reading. I told her it would be healthy for her to make some friends. Alice said it is hard to make friends when she is grounded from the park and has no cell phone. I told her she can have a cell phone is she lets me check it and that she can go to the park if she tells me where the condom wrapper came from but she wont. She says things like  \"I make better friends with book characters anyway\" and \"I prefer the characters lifes to my own life.\" I worry about Alice and asked her if she is happy to which she replied a simple \"no.\" When I asked why she replied that she feels stripped of independence and imprisoned.\n\nAlice is interested in wine and I suspect the reason is her parents had a wine farm. She knows more about wine than I do (theoretically). One time at the dinner table Alice poured herself a glass of wine and I said she cant have it but she can have a sip of mine. Alice said she didnt want a sip of mine and when I asked why she said it made her feel babied if she couldnt have her own glass. She told me all her cousins in France get their own glasses. I explained in this family we dont and Alice accepted but refused to try just a sip. I might also add that she no longer has any contact with her cousins in France because she deleted her Facebook account when I demanded to know her password.\n\nI think these examples have demonstrated Alice's unwillingness to compromise. Apart from this Alice is an easy kid. She never yells, always does her chores, always does her homework, offers me a helping hand whenever I need one, and I must say she is non-judgemental. She interacts well with my other kids but she is different. My other kids show a lot of emotions. They get angry and then happy and they laugh and they cry. Everyone in our family does, except Alice. She appears indifferent to most things. When I ask her to take out the trash she doesnt sigh and when I tell her we are going to an amysement park she shows no joy. She never seems happy, but she is always polite and kind. I guess it might be her personality, but I suspect she is unhappy. \n\nI don't know where to go from here. Should I stick to my rules (which arent unreasonble) and limit Alice's freedom (which appears to make her unhappy) when she won't compromise, or should I let her stay out at parties without a curfew and go to the park without telling me where the condom wrapper came from? Alice is an honest girl and obviously doesnt lie to me, which I respect her for, but it wouldnt be fair on my 17 yo if Alice can stay out without a curfew while she cant. The 17 yo has got herself into some normal teen trouble (bit of drinking, coming home too late, nothing major), but Alice has never broken a rule. I need some advice because the parenting style which works on all my biological children doesnt appear to work on Alice, and I dont know why.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Here's what I'm reading:\n\n- I need to know the intimate details of my kids lives, whether they *share* them with me or not.\n\n- My kids must accept my intrusions or they miss out on typical teenage things\n\n- My other/biological kids vs. Alice. Are these not ALL your kids - it sounds like you don't see Alice as your own and she likely feels ostracized.\n\n- I disagree with Alice's lifestyle and choices and so I am pressuring her to be more like my other/biological children.\n\n\nFirst, have you considered that not all children need the same rules and deserve to be treated the same? Yes, fairness is a major issue but you should be making rules on a case-by-case basis - not blanket rules that seemingly don't apply or work!\n\nSecond, teenagers need respect and control - that's essentially the struggle that adolescence is based on. Have you considered how your parenting style and the rules you insist upon leave no room for Alice to feel respected on in control of her own life? Why not sit down with her and ask her what SHE THINKS reasonable rules and restrictions are for having a phone, computer, going to a party. If you don't agree with what she sets forth, THEN you can negotiate or determine if she can have the phone and laptop or go to the party. The dictator/authoritarian style is not working on Alice. You need to come at it from a very different approach if you ever hope to make gains.\n\nThird, it sounds like she identifies with outsiders/outcasts and may possibly be depressed. Has this ever been addressed? Even if she may not directly remember her parents' death, it is still traumatic growing up knowing that you parents died. Perhaps, she needs some professional help and an outside perspective on this.\n\nFourth, I encourage you to use better communication with Alice. As it currently stands, you are FORCING her to share her life with you by snooping in her room, retaining the right to search her phone, grounding her unless she shares stories with you, etc. You are actively building up resentments rather than developing a healthy bond built on open-communication and trust. I don't agree with this strategy,\n\nFinally, by grounding Alice and forcing her to share about the sex scene and condom, you are actively shaming her for her sexuality and the way she may choose to express it. She's 15 years old. By your own admission, one of your daughters was sexually active at 14. Why is Alice not entitled to the same privilege? Why does she have to inform you of all the little details of her sexuality and her sexual experiences? Either there's a double standard OR you've set up a contingency in your home where your daughters are only allowed to engage in sexual activities IF they tell you about them - which honestly, is very odd to me.\n\nAnyhow, I look forward to your responses to the above and I'm happy to clarify any position I have.",

        "title": "15(F) is doing it all - sex, drugs, drinking, acting out. What can be done?",
        "content": "Sorry for this wall of text.\n\nMy brother, is a single dad. His daughter, Dee, is 15. She is super tall, and has always been. He thinks this is why she started acting more \"mature.\" Anyhow, he is having problems with her behavior, and since he has nobody else to ask, he calls me, his little sister. I don't have kids but he thinks I know everything, and frankly we have no other family for him to call. Yesterday he flat out said, \"What should I do?\"\n\nHere is what is going on:  Over the last couple years, she has been headed in this direction. She got caught making out with boys in jr high, then was caught lying and sneaking out at night. He dealt with these things by trying to talk to her about real consequences of risky behavior, which goes in one ear/out the other. She doesn't care, nor does she have any response to reason beyond a snort.  He has tried punishment by taking away things she likes, such as her iphone, ipod, internet access, restricting which friends she spends time with outside of school, grounding her, and more chores.  All of these things are temporary punishments, and eventually she gets all of this stuff back to the way it was prior to getting caught.  \n\nShe was caught having sex this year. She cried and said she did it in order to get back at a boy who she liked but rejected her. So she had sex with a boy who knows him so it would get back to the boy who rejected her.  We can't figure out the reasoning behind this, and he was not only dealing with the shock and sadness from learning about her activities, but he was also worried she would get pregnant. He took her to planned parenthood and got her on the pill.\n\nI should say, he has no health insurance. Well, he has health insurance with a very high deductible, so he avoids going to the doctor if possible. He has ruled out therapy because he doesn't think he can afford it. I've offered to help pay for therapy, but he believes it won't help her because she is so manipulative.\n\nThis year she has also engaged in more risky behavior. She gets in trouble at school for being disrespectful to her teachers. This is normal for her, and she has always been kind of a snot to everyone. It's her personality. Again, he does his usual punishments in addition to trying to talk to her using open ended questions and also tries to motivate her to do better by using positive statements and questions. She is a straight A student, and the only time her grade is a B is due to \"participation.\"  \n\nI gave my brother a car, which he intends to give to her when she gets her license. I realize now, this was probably a mistake. While he was at work on school days she had off, she took the car joyriding with her friends. She did this a few times before he figured it out and thereafter has to keep the key locked up. \n\nLast weekend, he was hit with a LOT of info. It started when he had a sense that something wasn't right. She was supposed to be at a \"sleepover\" with her friend Nell. He tracked her phone, and sure enough, at 2:30AM, the phone was not where she was supposed to be. Come to find out she had been having sex, drinking, and smoking pot that night. A quick check of her texts showed she is a veteran pot purchaser.\n\nSo of course I got a phone call. I suggested therapy, which he said no to. He wants to DO something, but doesn't know what to do. He took all of her stuff away again, but she doesn't care, she exhibits a bravado and confidence that she'll be able to do whatever she wants to do despite whatever he tries.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions aside from therapy? I'm working on that one myself, I talk to him about that every time he calls about this. I am willing to help pay for the therapy.  I'm looking for techniques you might know work in dealing with teens who are having these problems. Surely there are things parents can do themselves.\n\nETA: Thanks everybody for these wonderful ideas and comments. I'm going to show this thread to my brother to consider. I really appreciate everyone's time. Also, sorry for the lack of tl;dr!",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Maybe you should consider spending more time with her. Set aside a day a week to hang or an activity like working out together or some other class. Something that has you too spending regular time together. The female role model will be good for her and hopefully she will start to feel secure enough to talk to you. Spend your time listening to her rather than being a source of lecture (a role her dad is rightfully filling). Eventually you might be able to give her some good guidance when she's ready to ask. Close relationships with adults you don't want to disappoint is a HUGE influence to teens.",

We've talked to her for years about good choices, respect, etc. She knows more than she'd like to about birth control and protecting herself. She knows how much easier it would have been for all of us if her dad and I were older when we had her. It's pretty much all we can do for now. She hasn't started dating yet, so we'll have to see how it goes. \n\nAs a side note, my parents started dating when they were 12, got married at 22, and had me at 28.

        "content": "If you have a better place for me to post this to get a potentially better response please tell me, i don't have any idea, this was just the first place that came to mind.\n\nAnyways,\n\nFirst off, my girlfriend is going through difficult family times, her mother is a drug user and divorced her dad when she was younger, and now her dad was falsely accused of abuse by her older sister who moved out nearly ten years ago. This caused her dad to be taken away from her, and creating a stressful environment for both my girlfriend and her stepmother, between which there was tension previously as well.\n\nThat being said, my girlfriend's stepmom decided to go through her messages and discovered that we had sex. We have been together for 11 months, and it has been a part of our relationship for a while. Regardless of your opinion on teen sex, i am looking for your opinions on how to deal with her stepmom. \n\nAs it stands, she has likely lost all trust in me and will not allow us to be together until something changes. I am older than her, we are both high school age, but my age difference gives me hightened expectations of maturity in her eyes. The stepmom has about a 10 year age difference between her and my girlfriends dad, so she understands that aspect, and is not opposed to sex in a religious sense at all. She may be under the impression i am taking advantage of my girlfriend, but i can say in absolute confidence this is not the case.\n\nI have decided to talk to her about it upfront. I want to be completely honest and regain her trust while portraying my girlfriend and me in the best possible light. I think it is the best chance i have of recovering my dignity and respectability.\n\nI sincerely love her, and only want what is best for her. \n\nWhat, as parents or step parents, would you be looking for out of me? Promises? Reassurances? What would you want me to bring up or talk about to make you trust and respect me again?\n\nEdit: She has been sexually active in the past and her stepmom is aware of this.\n\nEdit2: I am 18 she is almost 16, but mentally she has always been above her age, if that makes amdifference. She would hang out with people of my year just as often as people of her year, if not more. Also, im aware this complicates things legally.",

Do not try to level with her parents. You are not on the same level. You can not talk mano-y-mano. It comes across as creepy, weird, and disrespectful. \n\n2. Do not refuse to do things as a group. Obviously you want to have sex with your girlfriend, but parents trust people they KNOW. Do you sit down to dinner with them? Go out as a group? They need to KNOW you naturally, not as the result of one big sitdown kumbaya moment. \n\n3. Do not insist about how mature you are. People who are mature almost never say, \"I'm really mature.\" \n\n4. Don't be \"totally honest\". Some things are, by nature, private and no one else's business. It's your girlfriend's decision to share details of her sex life with her family. Respect that. \n\nGood luck.",

Pages and groups with names in various languages, such as \"07 to 21 year old gays and bisexuals of Mexico\", \"Sexy Minors of ...\", \"Boys nudity\", \"Sexy Teens 13 to 19 Only\", \"Sexy Milf's and Teens\", \"Only for boys 11-15\", \"Sexy People Pre-teens\", an Interest list called \"pthc, lolicon, toddlercon\", \"Pies de ni\u00f1os de 13 a 19 a\u00f1os\" ( a teen foot fetish group) and thousands of other similar pages, profiles and groups where predators, groomers and pedophiles operate with impunity.\n\nComments of a lewd and sexual nature towards minors flood these pages. Requests for XXX kids videos and email addresses offered for sending child pornography can be found all over, adults requesting videocam chat with young teens abound, yet Facebook denies it has a problem with child exploitation. \n\nComments by adults found on just one of the above pages: \"seeking children with passive webcam\", \"I looking for gay boy. Nice add me \", \"my mail is ....... and .... that one last belongs to the skype ok there is we will be able to change photo and boy's videos of more than 12 years ok order me photo or video like that that you neis photo and boy's video of more than 12 years and or I add my group ok\", \"any one who wants to trade kids videos\".\n\nFacebook refuses to acknowledge the existence of these problems and mass reporting fails to remove 99% of such content.\n\nFacebook refuses to address the above issues in a legal, moral or socially-responsible manner.\n\nFacebook refuses to remove the above content in a timely and proactive manner.\n\nFacebook refuses to implement an adequate reporting system for above content.\n\nI/We the undersigned therefore demand Facebook institutes a zero-tolerance policy against any and all minor exploitation content of any nature, child sexual predators and groomers, and child stalkers, bullying and harassment of minors, as well as any and all content and activity leading to abuse, exploitation or victimization of minors.\n\nI/We the undersigned further ask of the international media to fully investigate Facebook's current policies and practices of allowing said content and their inaction in escalating multiple reports by the general public of said content for immediate removal.\n\nI/We the undersigned further request all NGO's, civic groups, activists and community leaders involved in the fight against child abuse or the promotion of child safety to join this campaign to ensure a safe online environment for minors on social networks.\n\nI/We the undersigned lastly require the advertisers using the Facebook network to promote their products and services to demand Facebook reviews current policies and implementation and add a clause to advertising contracts that any and all instances of child exploitation, grooming, harassment and bullying shall be removed immediately on receipt of report, with failure to comply resulting in withdrawal of advertising campaigns.\n\nFacebook shall act accordingly without further delay, and with the following proactive measures:\n\n1. Acknowledge the severity of the child abuse, grooming, exploitation and harassment on their site and respectfully cooperate with all those working hard to stop it.\n\n2. Incorporate a priority child abuse report function either integrated into existing report system or as a standalone page similar to reporting under-age profiles or convicted sex offenders.\n\n3. Set up a dedicated Safety Team, adequately staffed, at Facebook HQ manning report stations 24 hours a day and seven days a week.\n\n4. Immediately remove any and all content reported based on the above, and on receipt of ONE report, eliminating the potential for further sharing.\n\n5. Classify all pages, groups and profiles sharing sexually suggestive content of minors under the age of 18 as child exploitation and their immediate removal.\n\n6. The immediate removal of profiles making sexual or lewd comments towards minors displayed on pages, profiles and groups which collect images of teens in sexual poses or semi dressed or share content of or relating to minors.\n\n7. Accept the policy that a minor is a person under the age of 18 according to UN convention and child pornography does not have to include nudity.\n\n8. Improved training for team members who review reports to fall in line with all legal, social and moral responsibilities.\n\n9. Implement the same policy as for hate pages that requires questionable pages of sexual content to publicly attach the personal accounts of all page managers and content creators.\n\n10. Cooperate with activists and child safety groups who work on identifying exploitation and reporting to Facebook and immediately remove content when made aware of such.\n\nTo date, hundreds of thousands of Facebook users and members of the general public have signed several online petitions calling for a socially and morally responsible network which puts its under-aged users above financial concerns.

I know, most people think it's no big deal; teens will do what they do; blah, blah, blah... It IS a big deal to me. I'm angry at them for lying to me, I'm sad that she didn't wait for someone more permanent, I'm heartbroken because she already feels bad about it and wishes she hadn't done it, but she can never take that back. I don't know how to react, how to go forward with her, what limits to set... I just need advice. Please.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Okay, first of all, take a breath. You can't take this back so now you can only move forward. Most teens are not going to announce to their parents their plans to have sex, so while we almost always don't like finding out about it, try not to be angry about the lying part. That was completely normal.\n\n\nI'm also a very strict mom and taught my daughter that while I'm not opposed to premarital sex (in fact, I encourage it) I wanted her to wait until she was an adult and in love. She didn't, of course. Her boyfriend's parents allowed the two of them to be alone in his room for extended periods of time and even bought her her own pillow! Ugh.\n\n\nYou're going to need to take her for an OB appointment. Have all the STD testing done, just to be safe. Get her on birth control. That's the most important part. While we don't want them having sex, we REALLY don't want them getting pregnant. Talk to her extensively about what having a baby would do to her dreams for her future. Explain to her how accidents can happen, even with birth control. My oldest son was conceived on birth control. It happens. \n\n\nThen, explain to her WHY you really want her to wait. What sex means to you (it's about intimacy and love between adults, it has the risk of babies, it has the risk of STDs, etc) and encourage her to wait a few more years. As far as limits, try to make sure they don't have alone time in private. If you allow her to go out on dates, then they go to public places but not hang out at each other's houses without a parent present. Sure, they could still park somewhere, but it gets a lot harder.\n\n\nJust try to be loving and supportive with her. She made a mistake. She's a young girl. She's not perfect. You know how it feels to have hormones surging through your body. Talk to her about avoiding situations where that can happen again. Losing your virginity is not the end of the world. For most people, it's not even that big of a deal. If she waited for a permanent person (like a person she would marry) she would either be getting married too young or waiting until she was in her 20's. That's not very realistic. \n\n\nYes, it's a big deal, but you need to see it in the right light. It happened, it's over, now you need to buckle up and love and support her so she can move forward and make better decisions. You are her safety net for a reason. It's going to be okay. <3",

        "most_upvoted_comment": "As a single father of 3 (9,12, and 14), the \"talk\" has always been an ongoing thing. \n\nI know my 14 year old son is not a virgin, he appears to have lost it at 11 whilst living with his mother (I took over care of him at 13 after his mother developed severe mental problems, but thats another story). I have realised that he is going to want an active sex life with any future girlfriends he may have, and have decided it is better and more responsible of me to control that, by supplying him with contraception, and letting him use his own bedroom rather than trying to hide it from me. \n\nMy 9 year old began learning at 4 years old when she barged in on her mother changing a Tampon, and began to ask questions. As a parent, the policy here is complete honesty, at a level they can understand, at all times. She began puberty at 6 (breast budding), and at 9 is on her 3rd bra fitting, can be very hormonal, but understands all the differences between both sexes, how it all goes together, and the basic details of conception and pregnancy. She has said she is looking forward to her first period, as its a major step in a girls life. Now, she is just beginning to learn about the much more complicated concept of relationships, and how they work. \n\nMy 12 year old is the shyest of the three at discussing matters like this. She is fully aware of hor development, but discusses little with me. She has the same mother as the 14 year old (9 year old has a different mother who went AWOL very suddenly when she was 5, just leaving her on my doorstep with the simple words \"I cant cope anymore\"), but also has female family she can talk to, which she feels far more comfortable doing. Those female relatives then pass on any info they feel its essential I know. The only thing I have asked of her is that she informs me when her periods start, simply so I can buy things in. \n\nAll round, I feel I have the correct approach to this, and it appears to be working.",

        "content": "Hey Guys,\n\nSo obviously a throwaway, but I'm having a bit of a conscience attack. To **TL;DR** it, my brother-in-law just got married and had a baby girl. His wife doesn't know that he has three kids by a former marriage and that he was accused of molesting the two girls. What if anything should I do?\n\nBackstory: My brother-in-law's ex-wife \"discovered\" the molestation and brought this to the police. He was arrested and put on trial. Eventually the charges were dismissed, but the circumstances are really ambiguous. What we know is that he dropped all contact with the three kids (two girls, now teens and a 12 yo son). He claims everything was fabricated by the ex-wife, and blames the girls (going so far as calling his daughter a name I will not repeat). He was eventually dishonorably discharged from the military (only one year from retirement), they even flew in a teenage babysitter that he apparently hit on when he was still with his wife to testify at the military hearing. Even after criminal charges were dropped he has not petitioned to reinstate his benefits. \n\nI don't even know the guy really, I've been married to his brother for 10 years, but have spent less than 10 hours with him. Those have been unpleasant hours. Suggestions of wife swapping, stories of anal sex at the dinner table, questions about our sex life. Wildly inappropriate, though I have to say the entire family is kind of weird. Our marriage counselor called the relationship \"mentally incestuous\". Also, the guy \"propositioned\" my husband several times as kids (husband was 12, he was 17). Multiple cheating episodes, etc etc etc. \n\nSo I don't know what happened, his ex is kind of crazy, but if she's making it up she is really taking it to an extreme, it was long after they divorced. His new wife is not very intelligent, I hate saying that, but it's the truth. The family is very rough, seriously gun-weilding, meth smoking type of rednecks. It's hard to describe, but if you have ever seen the movie \"Winter's Bone\" then you know what I mean. I don't want anything to do with them, I don't know the guy anyway. But my MIL keeps venting to me about the situation and I feel incredibly guilty that the mom has no clue about his past. If something happens to this little girl I'll feel partially responsible. \n\nAdded complication: I think my BIL just started a big fight between his wife and mom to keep them distanced. She wound up telling the wife's sister (gotta love Facebook) that he had three kids but did not bring up the molestation charges. Now this crazy family is up and arms and defending the guy, saying she is just making trouble. She probably is! But I was hoping she'd at least tip them to the charges, that way they at least have their radar up, but she didn't. \n\nTHIS IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS!!!! I know this, and I want to stay out of it. But do I have any moral responsibility here? What would you do?  \n\nEDIT: For those of you that may be interested, the \"jig is up\" as they say. Somehow the new wife got wind of the ex-wife, extra three kids, and allegations. She has been asking my FIL a lot of questions about the trial and subsequent events. At least I don't have to worry anymore about her not knowing. And for all of those out there that thought/said...\"how do you know that he hasn't told her\", well now there's no doubt. She didn't have a clue about the first marriage, ex-wife, three kids and two separate allegations. Both have closed their Facebook accounts. Anything that happens from here on is the mother's responsibility.",

If this isn't the right place please let me know where is.  \n\nMy question is pretty simple: What do you do with teenage boys? I have five children; 3 girls, 2 boys. The girls were the older ones and have all moved out. It was much easier for me to know what to do (activities and such) with girls, as I used to be a teenage girl myself. But with the boys, it's just really hard for me to know what sort of activities they wouldn't mind doing with 'mom'.  \n\nThe funny thing is, I knew what to do with the girls but there were of course quite a few fights and struggles due to that whole female dominance thing that goes on. With the boys however, we get along MUCH better when it comes to discipline issues and even talking about serious things (drugs, alcohol, sex, etc), but I just don't know what to *do* with them. They're great boys! For being 15 and 13, the attitudes I encounter are normal, but also surprisingly respectful for the most part. I just feel guilty a lot of times because I have no idea what do with them, and then I start worrying because I know I'm running 'out of time' as far as how long they'll be living at home and stuff like that.   \n\nThey enjoy video games, going out with friends, being on the computer, riding bikes....fairly standard things for kids their age. I just don't know how to fit into their lives in a way that's not intrusive, but also lets them know I love them.  \n\nI have some fairly serious/painful medical issues that don't allow me to do things like, say, play softball, basketball or ride bikes with them. In fact, I'm about to have another surgery in about 3 or so weeks. But man, I just feel like time is slipping by and I don't want to miss out on building a stronger relationship with them.  \n\nTheir dad is quite busy with work and other things, so I also feel like one of us seriously needs to be working on making sure they have a better parental connection. As I said earlier, they do talk to me about serious issues, and I'm often surprised at how open they are with their feelings on certain subjects (especially surprised at my 15-yr old).  If anyone here has dealt with teenage boys, I'd sure appreciate any suggestions.  \n\ntl;dr: How do I build a better relationship with my teenage sons before they're grown and gone?",

I know you are their mom, but pick up the control sometime when they aren't home and play a campaign on one of their games, the controls are easy to figure out, or if you want just ask if they will teach you how to play. video games might not quite be your thing, but I loved it when my family got together and we all played wii. I pick up the control anytime my boyfriend is asleep and I'm finally getting better, but whenever he wakes up and hears me cussing out the tv he laughs at me and tries to help teach me.",

        "content": "My son (19) and his girlfriend (18) are having a baby and it\u2019s been hell. She\u2019s about 20 weeks pregnant and the past weeks have been nothing but pure hell for our family. I really liked this girl and even though her family was against them dating because we\u2019re not catholic or well off enough, according to them (we live in the same neighborhood), we were still supportive of them dating each other. I was very disappointed when I found out they were pregnant as I have always been open with my children about preventing pregnancy/STDs, etc. He dropped out of college so they could still see each other behind her parent\u2019s backs. However, I got over myself and told my son I would support them as much as I could. Well, the girl and her family have been weaponizing the pregnancy. At first, she was saying that she was getting an abortion. I told my son not to try to convince her otherwise (when he asked for my opinion) because it is her body her choice. After lots of back and forth he respected her decision but started self-harming (this happens every time they change their mind about what to do with the baby). After he \u201cagreed\u201d to the abortion she then said she was not having an abortion but wanted to give it out in adoption. We offered to adopt the baby but she said she does not want us to have the baby and prefer that her parents or another family (with \u201cmore money\u201d) adopts the baby. My son wants to be fully involved in the baby\u2019s life and was refusing to signing the adoption unless we adopted the baby as we\u2019re agreeing with both families being involved and not just ours. He would also like to co-parent or be a single father. Her parents said they\u2019d adopt the baby with the condition that we are not involved in the baby\u2019s life. They told my son they\u2019d let him be in the baby\u2019s life if he agrees to the following; joining the military (he was just hired by the federal government but they said that\u2019s not good enough), he marries her and they buy a house. If and only if they believe that he makes enough money and has a house in a good neighborhood then they\u2019ll \u201cundo\u201d the adoption. My son is suicidal and self harms almost daily. I\u2019m seriously tired of knocking on his door thinking I\u2019m going to find his dead body. They told him he has to marry her this week to show them how serious he is about the baby. I don\u2019t feel like attending this \u201cwedding\u201d because it\u2019s like seeing my son driving 100 mph to a wall. I also don\u2019t want him to feel unsupported and alone. He obviously loves this girl though I doubt she feels the same way. I have talked to my son about the legal options he\u2019d have once the baby is born, such as requesting shared custody. I believe that the parents will not undo the adoption and I\u2019m afraid what my son may do to himself if that does happen. The girl has told him that they\u2019ll be together if \u201cthe lord wants us together but for now we will not date or see each other alone.\u201d Yet, they want him to marry her. Any advice on the whole situation would be greatly appreciated.\n\nEnglish is my second language (self taught) so please pardon any grammatical and spelling errors.",

He selflessly put you and baby in danger by giving you STDs during pregnancy. What an AH.\n\nAs for your toddler. I want to believe this behavior is normal. Mainly because it sounds like you\u2019re describing my 3.5yo. My 3.5yo says those things too when her baby brother arrived. At first she was thrilled to have a sibling but as time went on she started to do the same. Throw tantrums, act out, become physical when she\u2019s angry at the person, regressed to crying for everything, screaming bloody murder for simple things like the 20sec countdown to the next autoplay Bluey episode on Disney+, to pooping/peeing in her underwear, and so on. She even said she doesn\u2019t like her brother and wants him to go home (leave). She has become possessive and jealous. Heck earlier today she spit in my face because I said no to wiping her butt. I wanted her to sit on the potty a little longer to see if she will poop. She\u2019s still holding it in as I\u2019m writing this. \n\nMy point, it will get easier and don\u2019t be too harsh on yourself. Your little humans are pure raw emotional energy balls and your toddler is working them out finding ways to cope with the changes. Learning how to share and understanding that you love each of them equally. You are doing great by being their loving mom with so much patience and kindness. Please be gentle on yourself.

        "content": "TLDR: immature youth is doing the cliche \"I hate you\" at Mom and leaving; do I just wait for them to grow up and get a clue?\n\nMy husband and I have one child, 20-year-old no gender. They have struggled with depression, ADHD, anorexia and we have tried to help them through the years with individual and family therapy, doctors, meds and a safe supportive home.\n\nAfter a fight over wanting them to do some exercise (starting with daily walks) and be able to get a job, they left in the night, leaving a note saying how I am horribly abusive and always have been and they want nothing to do with me.\n\nI of course am crying my eyes out. An example they gave of me \"being abusive\" is how when they used to have tangles in their hair I would hurt them when I would try to brush it out. Never mind that I bought every detangling product and special brush I could find to try to make this easier, they're citing this as evidence that I physically hurt them.\n\nSince graduating high school, we have tried to help them get a license but they haven't been able to pass the test. We've tried to teach them responsibility by having them do small chores at home and they've learned to do their own laundry, things like that. We have a college fund for them but they took a couple classes and flunked out and say that they are not interested in going to school now. They have filled out online applications for jobs but never gotten an interview.\n\nThe last 6 months we've been trying to let them be more independent. Although still living at home. We let them decide their own activities but just require that they have dinner with us each night. And being at home as made it so that we could notice if they were forgetting to eat. But as they rarely leave their room, we've been noticing that they've been having more physical pain and getting tired easily and not making any progress in getting a job.\n\nIn some ways I know that we have spoiled them, but mostly, we just wanted them to know that they are always safe and loved and supported. I definitely told them so nearly everyday. But we also try to teach them responsibility and limits. And I feel like we've been somewhat successful because they've never been the kind of kid that would ask for lots of new stuff. And thankfully we are quite certain that they are not doing drugs and don't seem to be interested. Also they identify as asexual so at least STDs and pregnancy aren't such a concern. \n\n(In case someone thinks that I'm confusing gender and sexuality, no, my child identifies as both asexual and non-gender so I understand the difference)\n\nSo if you've read this far, thank you very much for sticking with me.\n\nSo I have this hope that being out there in the real world a bit will make them realize that us asking them to work for 2 hours a day. Was really not a ridiculous requirement and much less than any job would ever require of them. I'm actually worried about how traumatizing they're going to find it when a future boss yells at them, considering what they think counts as abuse in our household. They have a friend who's letting them stay with them, mostly because they've told them that they can't be in our toxic environment of abuse anymore. But their friends can't really afford to be supporting a free loader.\n\nSome people have been telling me for a while that I should do more tough love than kick them out and make them learn about the real world. But part of the problem is we honestly worry that they will hurt themselves with their anorexia. \n\nOn the one hand, I want them to know that we always would give them a safe haven so they don't need to let themselves be in a dangerous situation out there out of pride or desperation.\n\nOn the other hand, I feel like if they come home I should really be requiring them to go to therapy because this is clearly such a huge mess with them.",

My son in particular hasn't been exactly discreet with his... puberty urges, so it's clear we need to discuss a few things soon.\n\nWe already had a few \"E-rated\" talks but the word \"sex\" hasn't been mentioned yet.\n\nMy wife (38F) and I (42M) have been discussing on how to handle it and we agreed on a few points. I would like to ask you if I've missed anything of importance or if we're overstepping our boundaries despite having absolutely no intention to do so. We only care about their safety and happiness.\n\nWe both come from conservative households and are fairly conservative ourselves but not anti-sex (quite the opposite in fact, but very discreet) so neither of us had the talk from our respective parents, therefore we're unprepared on how to handle it in this new society we live in.\n\nHere are the points we agree on:\n\n1. We will be discussing standard safety&laws talk together when the time is right. For my son we believe that time is now, as for my daughter we're waiting a couple of years. Having the talks at the same age seems fair.\n\n2. Wife will be handling female-specific talks with my daughter without involving me unless it's about something serious, likewise I will be handling male-specific talk with my son with the same conditions.\n\n3. Speaking of male-specific talk, I don't want my son to suffer a couple of issues I went through such as the dreaded deathgrip which took me years to recover from. I don't know how to tackle that issue in a sensible and appropriate way. I certainly don't want him to think masturbation is bad or unhealthy.\n\n4. We're going to tell them that they can ask anything they want on the subject if they wish to do so, however under no circumstances will we be discussing inappropriate intimate graphic details and we'll teach them the importance of privacy (like not to brag with friends). We will encourage them to speak up if something serious (STDs, abuse, pregnancy scares - condoms may break) happens, reassuring them we'll always be on their side. \n\n5. Sex-related discussions must always be age-appropriate. There is a difference between 14, 17 and 18+ years old. The younger they are, the less \"blunt\" terminology we need to use.\n\nI would appreciate your feedback and please forgive me if I said anything inappropriate, it's not my intention to do so! You never stop learning how to parent and we're open for suggestions!\n\nThank you kindly in advance!",

As the other person said, hammer home how important condoms are. Don't trust your partner when they say they have some type of birth control, pretty sure most of my teen sex had condom + girl on birth control, and condoms are also good for STD's. Don't forget to mention this also applies to oral sex. To come back to the topic. Sure, split them up, no, there is no \"gendered knowledge\". They both need to be aware of information for both genders.\n\n3) Not going to lie, stumped on that one too. \"Don't force anything\" might be the closest. Wanting to get that third orgasm before going to sleep is when you do that gripping tighter than is probably healthy.\n\n4) I thought that was the point of the sex talk? Especially at 14. So this one is just weird to me. Like, the idea of something being \"inappropriate\" at that age to discuss is just laughable to me.\n\n5) Disagree. Not saying to use the word cock or dick(they'll use that on the playground) but be CORRECT in your terminology. Penis, vagina, sperm, etc.\n\nAre you guys religious by any change? You seem really hesitant to actually HELP and INFORM your kids. At 14 he needs to know bloody everything to protect him from missinformation.",

So here's where i need some advice.\n\nShould i just go and buy him a \"dirty magazine\" (def a tamer one.. NOT \"TABOO\".. lol) and give it to him after having the talk?  I'd feel safer letting him beat the bishop in his room to a mag, rather than online, because of all the possibilites of computer viruses infecting his computer.. although, i'm certain he'd probably go look on my PC. \n\nI would definitely talk to him about attitudes towards sex (it's not the end all/be all of human existence) and that these are merely fantasy portrayals and that he should just keep worrying more about his schoolwork, rather than dating. I'm not going to shame him into thinking porn is bad, because i watch it myself, so i don't want him end up with the secretive attitude that he thinks his hormones are shameful.\n\nI get it.. if he's got hormones (he's already got the bad teenage peachfuzz) i just want him to know how to sanitarily take care of them himself in the comfort of his own room and privacy and not feel that he's done anything wrong. At 7th grade, he now gets home about 2hrs before everyone else, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll occupy that time ASAP once we go over this.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "As awkward as it can be for the parent, a straight talk without giggling is the best option. Maybe instead of a porn mag, try and get hold of an anatomy book aimed for children?\n\nAs for what the kids talk about - everything. This is the information age and trying to keep certain topics out of their heads by not discussing them is an exercise in futility. I'd definitely be forewarning him about the classic shock/horror images that kids love to tell each other about (blue waffle / goatse / lemon party etc - I'm sure there are plenty of new ones). A simple description and a warning about \"what has been seen\" should at least prepare him for the inevitable exposure.\n\nDefinitely taking the time to explain that porn is fantasy and that when couples are intimate it isn't like that can only be a good thing.",

We've had kind of a shorter talk years before but I think it's time for the big one (and hopefully the start of open communication to a degree?)\n\nI know there's a girl he texts with but I'm not about to go on his phone and see what's up.  I'm a big fan of privacy unless they lose my trust for some reason.\n\nSooooo I thought I'd better have a chat soon about everything and I want to see what y'all have talked about or wish you'd talked about and how it went . And maybe at what age you had the talk?  I'm anxious about it.  Mostly about messing up or forgetting things.\n\nSexuality (going over heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality and everything else), Transgenderism (of which he's aware of a certain level but I don't know to what degree so I'd like to make sure he's aware of what it is, how it affects people and how shitty some people can be about it), consent (another big one), STDs, anatomy, how things work, how to treat partners well and not be a douche, how to respect yourself when exploring the waters, how open I am regardless of his sexuality and how I'm perfectly fine with him coming to me with questions, concerns and so forth.  Basically a \"Look, I've fucked up a lot in life and learned a lot because of it.  Let me *try* to save you some pain from my mistakes.\"\n\nHe didn't invite said girl to his birthday party and hasn't mentioned her.  I'm not going to say I know but will gently prod to ask if there's anyone.  I just want to let him know somehow that if there's a girl or boy he's interested in, he doesn't have to hide them away.  I'm not one of those parents that will tease him for dating anyone - male or female.\n\nI'd love to hear from people, especially on the dating front since that's an entirely alien concept to me as a parent.  My parents were Catholic and barely around and I was pretty introverted as a youth so that doesn't help, either.  I don't know what boundaries to set or what to bring up or anything.\n\nHeeeelp.",

Every alarm bell in our heads ringing, we let her stay with a friend out of state. \n\nHere's the circumstance. We moved west from east. She never really recovered over the last couple of years from that. Its been difficult for her.\n\nLately, she's been getting more stand-offish. Hindsight being 20/20 I see that now as a warning sign.\n\nWe headed out east, and a boy shows up. Every alarm bell in my head is ringing. But we stuck to the plan. She was staying with her friend, her parents are aware of the situation, and their kid is my kid's best friend. The entire drive home both of our alarm bells are going off, but we're confident that what we have told our kid will stick.\n\n**Nope.**\n\nWell. Horny teenagers are horny teenagers. Daughter found a way to have sex with this kid outside of anyone knowing. Unprotected anal.\n\nShe admitted it to us today upon her return home. \n\nThe sex isn't the problem. If you read my thread history you'll see that pretty clearly. She's on birth control. She's been educated. Looks like preparation was not there.\n\nThe problem is the lead-up.\n\nMy daughter is for the second time in a row, not being straight forward and open with us *despite* a clear support of her and sexual freedom. Its a different boy, since the other broke up with her some months back due to distance.\n\nThis boy insisted that the relationship be kept secret. So he convinced her to lie to her parents about them, breaching the trust between parent & child for *his* sake.\n\nThis boy was frightened of \"being found out,\" being \"embarassed.\"\n\nThis boy is from a broken home. Parents divorced blah blah whatever. Both of my kids are from broken marriages, that hasn't (until recently it seems) done anything to upset that balance.\n\nThis boy has cried in front of her to make her feel sorry for him.\n\nThe boy claimed \"to be gay\" therefore he wanted anal sex from her.\n\nThis boy even cried after the act and said that he would kill himself if she wound up pregnant. \n\nSo he's unprepared for sex, and doesn't understand that anal sex does not result in pregnancy, and if that somehow turned into a real baby, he'd put a gun in his mouth. \n\n\n\nWhoohoo... daughter picked a winner. Wife is ready to drive the 15 hours out east to take a baseball bat to his face.\n\nThese to me are hallmarks of a kid who is a sociopath, and he has her caught in his web. Thankfully, it is easy to just not go back east where this kid can easily get to her. A thousand miles or so is a pretty long way for a teenager who can't drive to go to achieve his ends.\n\nUnfortunately, she is entirely under is spell, and convincing her that this \"relationship\" is toxic is going to be an uphill battle. \n\nI'm going to flat out say this. What the ever loving fuck. I was not ready for this. Am still not ready for this. Wife and I were blindsided by it. Still trying to figure out a way to coax her out of the relationship without her going total rebel/runaway on us in order to \"be with her love.\"\n\nWe've bought her condoms for her own sake, explained STD's *again*, explained that if there is no protection there is no sex, period, end of story. Explained that her body is her own to do what she wants with, and that there is no shame in sex--only a shame in lack of preparation. \n\nWould love to hear some advice about how to coax her away from this sociopath.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "14 is super young to be having sex. Obviously she is not emotionally ready to be having sex. Maybe you guys were too open with her. But since he lives so far away I am sure it will just fizzle out. It's not like they can see each other without parental help so just don't facilitate it. The boy will get bored and find someone to trick locally. Can you get in touch with his parents maybe via Facebook and let them know what he is up to maybe? His parents probably aren't as sexually open as you guys are.",

        "content": "15 year old has always been pretty good. Typical teen stuff, but always respectful and seemed to obey rules.   We figured she was pushing some stuff and counted it as normal teen crap.  She gets straight A's. We know she goes to parties and had a boyfriend for over a year.  I got her on birth control and we always have had open communication. 2 weeks ago DH caught her sneaking back in at 2:00 am on a school night. She broke up with her boyfriend about 5 weeks ago and was snuck out to meet a guy friend who she told me she had a crush on.  Her dad (I am her step mom)  grounded her for the weekend from going out and limited device time.  2 weeks later we went to a play on a Thursday night.  (We have cameras for security.   Have had them for years.  Before we never turned the inside living room on unless we were traveling because we didn't feel there was a reason.  Of course after the sneaking out, we put that one on. The outside ones have always been on.) While we were at play we realize she has snuck this boy in through our kitchen window.  He also showed up on our backyard camera.  He looked up and then ran from it.  We were livid.  We have a long standing rule that no boys over without one of us being home.   We found a used condom in her garbage bin (yay for using condoms!) So this confirms everything. Again DH grounds her for the weekend and we back her curfew to 8:00 on the weekends for a month. Also all devices will be collected at 8;00 PM for a week. So now Friday night she walks out at 9:00 saying she is going to her aunts who lives a block up.  She then calls her aunt and asks her to lie fir her because she is going to a party.   Her aunt refuses and tells us.  This child shut her phone off so we couldn't find her and stayed out all night.  At 7:00 am we start texting her friends.  Immediately her phone goes back online and we figure out she is at this guy's house.   DH calls her and says get her ass home or police will be called.  She doesn't leave.  We figured out who owns the home and who the parents are and DH says I am coming up there to talk to John and Sara (parents first names,  that we shouldn't know) That got her out of there and she went to her aunts.  We have cut service to her phone, deactivated her bank card, took all her cash and deposited into her account. She is grounded from going out except to aunt and her grandmother's.  Both live a couple blocks away.  She is saying she is going to leave and we can't stop her.  We are at a loss.  We are going to make an appt with her doctor to do a drug panel.  We took her to an obgyn last week and asked for an STDs screening,  but the doctor refused and said they don't do exams on 15 year olds.  Also did not refill her birth control.  She has been flying without it for 2 weeks now becau6tge pediatrician stopped filling it.  I assume she is due for a check up, but there was no warning.  I wanted her to get it from a obgyn so it wouldn't be held hostage.  It is important... also I wonder if some of this crazy is because the loss of her bc pills.\n\nWe are at a loss. What do you do when a teen just blows up like this.  There was no yelling or screaming. Her dad always stays calm and talks to her in the morning.   Not reactionary.   We don't feel like this is a battle we can lose but we don't know what to do.  Feels like the hole is just getting deeper and we don't want to create unrealistic consequences.   I was rebellious,  but she has gone beyond anything I did.  Also she blames me for all the rules.  I have contributed ideas, but I stay out of it and her mom and dad have all the decision making power.  Any help?  I know there is probably no easy answers.  \n\nAlso we contacted the boys parents and told them everything.  We have all agreed that these two kids are not welcome in each others homes right now.  They were very upset too and had no idea.",

My nephew came from a good home but he is gay and wasn't comfortable in his home anymore. My sister is LDS and his town was overwhelmingly Mormon, so he asked if he could move in with us since I left the church when my kids were little and we have always maintained a very close relationship. \n\nHe is much happier here. He plays on the water polo team and runs hurdles for his schools track team. He did well on his SAT and ACT exams. He takes AP/honors courses, does his homework without being reminded, and is helpful with my bio kids. All in all it has been great having him here. Now that he has gotten more comfortable we have struggled with boundaries.\n\nWe didn't give him a curfew as long as he was home when he said he would be home, but lately he's been coming back at 4am or 5am. When I ask what he has been up to he just says hanging out. I don't think he's getting into anything bad but I don't like the idea of him biking or walking around at that time. The area is safe but not knowing what's going on is hard. \n\nHe also started dating. From what I can tell it isn't serious, we have talked about using protection to protect against STDs, but I'm not sure what the rules should be surrounding his boyfriend. I haven't gotten to that point with our biological kids yet. I let them hang out in his room, but things like sleepovers are still a mystery on how to handle. I wouldn't let my kids have their SOs sleepover at 16 but we don't have a problem with sleepovers in general. The boyfriends parents are okay with my nephew sleeping over there but again, I don't know how to feel about it. Mostly they just play Halo and watch Netflix in the den, but sometimes they'll head up to his room to hang out up there. \n\nThe last thing is checking his cell phone and internet history. He made a comment about how it's cool that I don't do that because his mom used to check his history all the time. I told him that I'll only check if I am concerned and he gave me his passwords without much prying. I feel like he's much too old to be checking his history. Is that naive. I mean, I'm taking the kid on college tours for crying out loud. Surely he can manage his internet history on his own.",

It's probably best that he take more ownership for his relationships and his digital life now, with you there to back him up.\n\nThe only thing that gives me a little pause is the curfew. I think staying out late is fine for college-age kids who have proven they can handle it (i.e. no curfew for adults living at home), but I'd probably set something for a 16YO.

        "content": "Our eldest daughter recently turned 15.   She is a parent's delight in pretty much every way.   She respects her folks and (most of the time!) treats her little sister well.   She is consistently an excellent student and adults who get to know her are impressed with both her sense of responsibility and her maturity.   \n\nMostly, we live a drama-free existence.   There are a few exceptions.   She is the Captain of her soccer team and a couple of girls on the team resent that as she is not as athletically gifted as they are.    Also her little sister (age 11) completely idolizes her which our 15 year old absolutely loves half the time and absolutely hates the other half of the time.   Other than that, life is amazingly calm and happy at our house (yes, we are blessed!).\n\nOur daughter has a lot of friends, both female and male.   They tend to hang around our house (yeah, I feed them!) so we know them pretty well and it's entertaining to watch them interact.   She's had crushes on a couple of boys but none have risen to the level of \"boyfriend\" and she doesn't yet seem interested in dating.\n\nWe try to keep open communications with our daughters.   One day, when our eldest was in 7th grade, I came home unexpectedly early from a trip to the grocery.   I discovered her masturbating in her room.   Things were a little awkward for a day or two.  When she started showing her face again, we sat down and discussed it.   I explained that many girls masturbate and there is nothing wrong with it, but I reminded her that there is a door on her bedroom and it was sometimes a good idea to close it.    The talk went well and in the end it was a good ice-breaker as she has been surprisingly open in asking questions and talking about sex and relationships ever since.\n\nWhen our daughter started high school my husband and I took a walk with her and had a general discussion about responsibilities around safe sex, STDs, pregnancy, etc.    We ended the talk by telling her that, if she ever decided that it was a good idea for her to go on birth control, we would work with her and her doctor to make that happen.    We were quite surprised when, about a week later, she came to us and said that she wanted to go on birth control to prepare for the future and to take responsibility for her own body.   So ... she's been on the pill for the last couple of years and I also accompanied her as she bought a box of condoms.    To the best of our knowledge she's still not sexually active.   (We're pretty certain that we would know ... she is extremely open about sharing pretty much all aspects of her life with both of us).  \n\nA few days ago she surprised us again.   She told me that she'd used an Amazon gift certificate that she'd received for her birthday to order a vibrator.   I'm not sure what a parent is supposed to say when told that so I just blurted out the first thing that came to my mind ... \"When you send Grandma a thank you note for her birthday gift you might not want to be particularly detailed in your description...\".\n\nThat night, my husband and I discussed what she had said.   We don't have any problem with our daughter owning a vibrator but we tried to decide what made her share that with us.   We considered the possibilities ... she might be trying to shock us, she might be trying to open a discussion to tell us something else or maybe she was just trying to show her independence and maturity.   In the end, we decided the primary motivation was probably none of those.   We decided that the most likely explanation is that our daughter is just a very open person and she didn't want us to be surprised by anything.   \n\nI think we missed this lesson when we attended that Parenting 101 class!\n\n(We can't wait to see what it's like raising her little sister through adolescence!)\n\nYour thoughts?    Has anyone else had a similar experience or does anyone have a kid who seems to want to share everything with his/her folks?",

I don't see anything thing wrong with her having a vibrator, I actually think it is quite healthy for her to take the time to learn about and explore her own body sexually before doing it with someone else. It will help her to have a healthy sex life. \n\nIt sounds like you're doing a great job as parents!",

I went to use the bathroom and in the toilet was a bloated tampon floating with wrapper alongside it. There was a residue on it as well. I am the only other female that lives in our house, no other females have been in our house in the last 45 minutes, and his father is at work. The only other person that lives in this house is a 8 month old baby, who was with me outside. I checked my tampon stash and indeed there were more than a few missing from the last time I used them. \n\nThis is also not the first time this has happened. A couple years ago was the first time I caught him doing it. Not in the act, but I went to the bathroom and a clearly soiled one was sitting on top of the trash in the bin. Also, lots of tampon wrappers lazily thrown under his bed not hidden from the naked eye, and soiled ones in his bedroom as well.\n\nThe last time this happened, I was just kind of flabbergasted. I didn't know how to handle it so I just moved the tampons to my bedroom, said \"those items aren't for your use,\" he denied knowing anything about it, and that was really the end of it. I started keeping them back in the bathroom very recently and thought that there were fewer than I remembered, but attributed it to a memory lapse.\n\nI am pretty certain I know what he was doing with them, and that's not the question at hand, but rather how to handle it. I don't want to make him feel weird, and I know at his age hormones are really starting to rage, but it's really not an appropriate item to be experimenting with, and I'm certain he doesn't understand female necessity for those either. Anytime we try to talk about anything remotely educational about sex, he just shuts down and doesn't listen. I know that if I accuse him he's going to deny it, and there really isn't any question that it was him, but I want him to know that not only are they expensive and a necessity for a woman, but something bad could happen just shoving random things up there, he could really hurt himself. I work in the medical field so maybe I could approach it more medically? I don't know. I just know that he gets extremely embarrassed when anything anatomical is brought up. I just need some outside perspective. \n\nAlso just in case anyone is wondering why I don't make his dad talk to him, it's because they don't see each other during the week due to school/work conflicts and they really only spend time together on the weekend. I don't want to make his dad have to talk to him several days after things happen, so I tend to be the person who handles stuff immediately during the week.\n\nI was also not sure where exactly to post this, I hope this subreddit is okay. And sorry if this is a little disjointed, I'm a little worked up over this weird situation. If anyone would like to hear some more stories to give a little more background, I'd be happy to oblige.\n\n\nEdit: Since I posted this last night right before he went to bed, I'm going to tackle this one when he gets home from school in a few hours. I'm heading to the store right now to see about picking up an educational book for him and think about exactly what I'm going to say. Definitely going to be approaching it from a medical standpoint since he doesn't tend to listen to advice given to him any other way. Thanks for all your advice, it is extremely appreciated to have an outside view on things. I will update later today after our talk is over.\n\nEDIT 2: UPDATE: Sorry this took so long, but things have been a bit hectic lately. Before he got home I decided to kind of write an outline of the things I wanted to go over in addition to the main problem to lessen the weirdness hopefully. He got home and I said that we needed to have a talk because I felt like I hadn't heard the schools talk about any sort of sex ed and there were some things I thought he needed to know. I covered everything from puberty to anatomy to stds, and worked in the proper etiquette when it comes to self exploration. I had already covered why feminine hygiene products were important for women but I explained that there are serious dangers associated with them, even to use them as a woman. Then I covered the dangers of putting things in your rectum and how I've seen first hand the problems they can cause when working at the hospital. I also added in a bit about how you can actually buy appropriate items for such things and needs to be safe about it. Overall I think it went pretty well, he even asked a few questions, and didn't seem too mortified by the end of it! I'm just hoping more than anything that he actually listened and will be safe. \n\nThanks for all of your advice and PMs over this matter. You guys gave me the balls to do it and I'm very grateful!",

She was so worried I was going to end up there.  She was certain that if people my age were doing something then I might be interested in doing that too.\n\nShe'd wait until we were driving somewhere.  She would engage the child safety locks, and then she'd start talking.\n\nIt was mortifying. \n\nI also learned an incredible amount.

        "content": "I have a teenage daughter (15). She knows I'm on reddit, hence the throwaway. I was helping her with a school project and had to use her laptop to load some images for her. Her iMessage came up when the computer restarted and I saw text messages from someone I don't know. She was talking about having had sex with him, oral and other, even mentioning anal. Not sure if she actually had done that. \n\nI'm not blind to the fact that my daughter has grown up. I realized she would be getting into things like that. My wife and I have talked to her and try to be protective but also supportive. We don't in any way condone her doing this. But from the messages, it looks like she has even snuck this kid into the house. My house. Is this normal teenage behavior? Do I need to be more stressed than I already am? Has anyone else dealt with this? How do I talk to her about it? I am beside myself. I just don't know how to approach it. Please, any advice would be helpful. \n\n\n\n[UPDATE] I don't know that anyone is interested, but since I was so thankful for all your responses, I thought I would tell you how it went. I took your advice and locked her in a closet and threw away the key. Kidding. Ok, I didn't take EVERYONE'S advice. \n\nMy wife and I sat her down. I had to do most of the talking. My wife is a bit of a crier. I told her how I found out. I admitted to her that, while I have always respected her privacy, this was simply too big to ignore. I did apologize. But I told her that sex was a natural extension of human life. We are animals. We are hard wired that way. I told her I understood her desires. but I did make it clear that while I didn't condone it, I understood it was going to happen. I talked to her about safe sex, STDs, and being \"physically\" safe. I told her that I knew there was so much misinformation about sex out there, that I wanted her to know right from completely wrong. \n\n I also told her that she was my most prized possession. And I wouldn't lend my car to someone I didn't know. How did she expect me to feel about some boy wanting to \"borrow\" her? She said she really hadn't thought about it like that. She admitted to sneaking him in late one night and said she had really messed up with that. She listened and smiled. And sat with my wife and I for a long time after just taking to us about why she had done some of those things. We talked for 2 hours and at the end, she said she wasn't upset that I had read her messages and she was glad that we weren't disowning her. She came over to me on the couch and leaned against me and held my hands and told me she understood and wanted to be able to talk to us. She had a longer conversation in private with my wife (she's a nurse). I'm sure that there are things that my wife can tell her that she is more comfortable sharing. \n\nIn the end, she sat with me and asked me to help her with her homework, then ate dinner with me. She didn't cry. She listened. I told her that I didn't know who was more nervous during that talk: her or us. She laughed. In the end, I held it together. I didn't cry. I didn't yell. I talked. A lot. And she listened. And asked questions. And I think we'll be better off for it. Thank you to everyone for your time and your words. I'm so thankful that I waited to talk to her. I was beside myself last night. I would've said the wrong things. But I waited. And now, this will hopefully be a learning experience for us all.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Well, my first piece of advice is to let the shock wear off before doing or saying anything.  The way you handle this will lay the groundwork for the way your relationship with her on this topic will evolve.\n\n\nFirst, keep in mind that this is not anything unusual.  You don't have to like it, but your daughter is not some kind of deviant or \"slut\" or anything like that.  Teens experiment with sex.  They did before our time, and will long after we are gone.\n\n\nI think you need to fess up about reading her messages. She may get defensive or mad, but you can't unsee at this point.  You can strike a simple bargain - if she forgives you for going through the messages - you forgive her for anything in them she shouldn't have done. Not the sex itself per se, which isn't something I would punish over - but sneaking someone into your house is obviously unacceptable.\n\n\nGoing forward you have to work on having open communication on this subject.  Talk to her about birth control, and take her to a doctor to discuss it if she would like.  Talk to her about relationships, respect for herself and her partners, and safety.  \n\n\nHer having sex in your house may not be acceptable to you.  If so, make that clear - but understand teenagers will find a place to have sex if they want to bad enough.  You have to balance them being in your home, and somewhere not nearly as safe.\n\n\nAt this point the best thing you can do is try to make sure she has the information needed to make good decisions going forward. Try to help guide her - but don't make the decisions for her.  Equip her to make these decisions, because she is going to have to make them for the rest of her life.\n\n\nAs I mentioned before, sex is not unusual for teens.  Just because your daughter decided to have sex, it doesn't mean she will change in any way other than that.\n\n\nA few months ago my 16yo son started dating his current 16yo girlfriend.  I thought she a very sweet girl.  She had a great sense of humor.  She was bright.  She came from a nice family.  My son was completely head over heels for her.\n\n\nAs time went on they became sexually active.  You know what?  She's still a sweet girl. She still has a great sense of humor.  She's still bright.  She still has a nice family.  Most importantly I guess, my son is still head over heels for her.  The only difference is she is having sex with my son. Really that's all that changed.  She's still the same person.",

For several years, my son\u2019s best friend has been a 14-year-old boy that is on his soccer team. \n\nThis kid's parents aren\u2019t exactly model parents (even though they\u2019re not abusive as far as we can tell) and this kid would come over after practice most days. I work full-time from home so I\u2019m around but not hovering over them. \n\nMy daughter and my son are very close, so the three of them would be hanging out mostly in the living room but occasionally in my son\u2019s room. My \u201coffice\u201d is in the kitchen so I could hear them but not see them. \n\nThen I walked in on my daughter in her room making out with this 14-year-old kid in her room. For reference, she turned 13 in September and he turned 14 in August so they are very young. I was very shocked and obviously unhappy when I stumbled on them, and I have to admit that my first thought was that he had somehow taken advantage of her. I'm ashamed of it now but she's young and even though he's not a trouble-making kid he seems more mature and I really thought he was the instigator. She makes it seem mutual but I'm still not sure what's really going on. I had to clarify that with her but by the time I got through that conversation she was already digging in her heels and talking about how she loved him. She thinks (pretty much correctly) that we're going to make them break-up and doesn't want to talk to me about it as well. I've attempted several mother-daughter heart-to-hearts, but she's not sharing. She's never really shared a lot in the first place to be honest, it's just her personality. I talked to her about safe sex/STDs, but there wasn't much to say because she's already on the Pill for medical reasons.\n\n My husband was in favor of just telling her that she can\u2019t date anyone including him, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely to work. I also feel bad about punishing my son by not letting him have his friend over, but on the other hand he knew about his sister and his friend. \n\nI guess the other option is to allow the relationship to continue under strict supervision but my husband and I had a long talk about it and realized that we don\u2019t really feel she\u2019s old enough for a relationship in the first place. We could say that he can come over and they have to stay downstairs but first of all I don\u2019t think she will obey that rule and second of all, I don\u2019t really want to condone their relationship when I think that they\u2019re both so young.",

Speak directly to them both about how you will support them having a relationship, but that you are going to help them set appropriate boundaries for it.  \n\nBoundaries that aren't just about what they can't do (be alone in her room together), but also about what they do. Like how they treat each other, and how they communicate.  Maybe find them some good resources about how to make relationships function.\n\nWhether you are ready for it or not, your daughter is starting to explore what adult relationships feel like.  Any attempt you make to shut that down is really a lost opportunity to help her learn good lessons now so that she can have healthy, respectful, consensual relationships in the future.\n\nGood luck.",

Anatomy, menstruation, sexual orientation, intercourse, alternatives to PIV, condoms, STDs, conception and pregnancy, birth control, masturbation, privacy/discretion thereof, sexual response and orgasm, ejaculation and semen, consent, enthusiastic consent, rape, porn and the utter fakeness thereof, polyamory, jealousy, prostitution, how sex is a huge emotional lever/amplifier and the related risks, various attitudes and hangups in society, intersections with religion, how some things are thus not a topic for discussion in the playground... pretty much everything I could think of. There were diagrams, photos and some carefully-selected videos (thanks to the person who responded to my earlier thread) - finding non-pornographic yet actually informative imagery was the hardest part of the entire exercise.\n\nIt's just amazing how non-awkward it all was. There was uproarious laughter at some bits, a few 'ew, gross' moments, a fair few more 'Huh.' moments, a bunch of 'well, people are stupid, what's it to them?' responses to various taboos and intolerances... it wasn't embarrassing, it wasn't traumatic, he was interested and asking questions, but not inappropriately focused on anything.\n\nI daresay some things may not have particularly sunk in, but nbd, he's got a framework for them to fit into when they come up again.\n\nEarly (or relatively so), frank and thorough.

        "content": "**Edit**: I know that as awkward as this experience is for me, my wife has had much more uncomfortable tests, with the potential for more on the way. I just wanted to share a perspective you don't often see in fertility stories.\n\n------------------------\n\nHey everyone,\n\nThis is a story that I don't feel comfortable telling my closest friends, so I thought I'd share with the entire internet instead. My wife and I are currently having trouble conceiving our second child... it's been about 10 months, and still nothing. It's been hard on us and our sex lives, and we've finally progressed to the step of taking some tests to make sure everything is working as it should.\n\nI don't know if you've ever taken a male fertility test... I've taken about four, and they all were awful. The first two were with a generic lab. I'd take a plastic cup home, do my best to get a \"sample\" (all while aiming into the cup right near the end, which as you can imagine is hardly an aphrodisiac) and then rush it over to the lab as quickly as I could. I'd run into the reception area with my brown bag, hand it off all awkwardly, and retreat to my car as quickly as possible. After two of these tests, I was informed that this lab didn't actually run the type of fertility test I needed. They only did post-vasectomy tests, not the amount/shape/motility tests that I needed.\n\nSo I found an appropriate lab and made an appointment. Turns out that they need to you do the deed onsite. I don't know what I expected, but I assumed there would be some sort of room with maybe old porn mags or something like that. Nope. It was 4X4 bathroom stall right next to the reception area. I'm trying to concentrate and all I can hear are the people coming up to the front desk talking about their blood-borne diseases and STDs. I know I'm not going to get there \"unassisted\", so I pull out my phone and look up some porn. It *almost* works, but the reception is so bad that I have to keep my phone raised up high above my head to keep the signal. Felt like I was mastering some Cirque du Soleil contortionist techniques, but finally, I got what I needed into the cup, left the bathroom, and looked for the assistant to hand everything off.\n\nOf course she was filling out paperwork in the back, so she just asked me to wait next to her until she was done. She's asking me questions about the holiday, and I've got a cup of ME in my hand. How does one hold a cup like that appropriately? I felt like if I held it too tightly, maybe it would get too hot? But if I hold it too loosely, now I've got one pinky pointed out like I'm holding an expensive cocktail. The answer is that there is no good way to hold a cup of splooge.\n\nAnyway, cut to a few days later and the tests came back inconclusive. Now the fertility clinic where my wife has registered wants to do their own version of the test. I head into the city and walk into their office, and this place is just night and day different than the generic lab. Everything has been organized for your comfort, which you would think makes me more relaxed... but no. It's **worse**.\n\nThey usher me into a room that is so well equipped to handle the deed, I find it disturbing. Here's what their \"men's room\" contained:\n\n* A leather easy chair, with a fresh linen sheet draped over the seat.\n* A giant flatscreen tv hooked to a computer, aimed at the chair.\n* A Pornhub icon shortcut on an otherwise empty screen\n* Linens to wash yourself, before and after.\n* Mineral oils\n* A cabinet to place the cup when you're finished. You flip a light switch when you're ready to have a nurse come (from the other side of the wall) and take the cup out of the cabinet.\n* Mood lighting\n* Wood paneling everywhere\n\nI know this was supposed to make me feel at ease, but all I could think about were the staff meetings where jackoff comfort was the main item on the agenda. The fact that people had thought so hard about every element in this room creeped me out. Plus it felt a bit like a limousine: trying to seem upper-class, but all I can think about is how many butts have sat in this seat before. At least I didn't have to traipse around the office looking for a nurse when I was done.\n\nAnyway, the results came back more or less okay, which is good I guess, although I wish there was some concrete answer for the issues we've been having. More tests are up next, and we're going to keep trying naturally for another couple of months before any interventions.\n\nIf you got this far, thanks for listening.",

He made it home but has no memory of how he got here.  He finally told me two months later when he found out he had Chlamydia.  His long term girlfriend thinks he cheated on her and has dumped him, he couldn't tell her the truth initially and when he did she didn't know what to believe.

We have been careful for the last year, I\u2019ve tracked my ovulation and we never have sex around the time I\u2019m to ovulate. This last period we had sex two days after my intended ovulation date as I was told by my dr that after 24 hours, you\u2019re no longer able to get pregnant. Welp\u2026.guess that wasn\u2019t valid. I\u2019m currently being treated for depression. I ended up with PPD that went undiagnosed and untreated for a year until after I had my son and my mental health started to spiral even more.

        "content": "Hi Everyone. Before I begin I want to say that if I am not making sense it is because I am just completely at a loss to the point where I have to reach out to internet strangers to try and find some help and advice for my son. I'll also give some background first. In case you don't want to read this, the jist is that my 15 year old son is absolutely out of control and I am fighting this uphill battle on my own. I have contacted all types of different resources only to get stonewalled and make no headway and I have no idea what to do. I love my son, and I don't want to lose him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy son Leo is 15 almost 16. He has always been a sensitive child, and takes things very literally. In hindsight I now realize that it may have been a very early sign of something else. He was raised by his father and I together until he was about 9 when we physically ended our marriage and separated, and he was 11 when the divorce was final. The entire process was civil and amicable, and it was all a mutual decision, and in fact we never stepped foot in a courtroom and did everything via lawyers and discussions. There was a lot that had to be figured out and agreed upon which is the reason for how long it took, but it was honestly a seamless process and I don't think we ever even disagreed on anything throughout the entire thing. He spends every weekend with his father since we separated, and he resides with me Monday-Friday. Coparenting with my ex husband has been almost seamless except for one point of contention: following through with consequences and aligning with our expectations for our children.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor example, and this actually happened today, our daughter who is 9 is a gymnast and needed to attend an extra training today to get ready for an upcoming competition and her father didn't bring her because \"she didn't want to leave her cousin.\" On the more serious end of that, anytime our son has ever needed any type of redirection or punishment, that punishment ends at 5pm on Friday when his father picks him up. His reasoning has always been, \"I don't want him to be mad at me and not want to come on the weekends anymore and if I didn't see it, how can I punish him for it.\" So, unfortunately, my ex husband's house has been an absolute free for all for the better part of 4 years. This has caused some issues as you all can imagine. When my son started coming and going on his bike with his friends, he had a curfew of 9pm. However, there was no curfew at his father's house so he started pushing that boundary with me and breaking it. On the nights that he didn't break it, he just snuck back out after I went to bed. He's not allowed to drive around with this kid from the neighborhood because he's quite literally a terrible influence, however his father doesn't see a problem with it because \"he has to make his own choices and as long as he answers his phone there's no problem.\" This inconsistency between the households, I believe, has led to a severe path of destruction for my son. Sneaking out at night, skipping school, experimenting with drugs and alcohol, and as of this past week, committing felonies. And as the week has gone on, it has gotten much, much worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's where we are now. Last week he entered a building tied to our family, without permission, and \"partied\" with his friends. It got out of his control and an attempt to rob the place was made. He told me that he was going to a friend's house up the street with a few friends and asked if I would bring his other friends home. His location services on his phone showed that he was at this friends house the entire time which means he either turned his phone off or left his phone there so he wouldn't get caught not being there since he knows I check it. They got caught for the drinking part when they all got in my car smelling of alcohol. I dropped these kids off, tried to talk to their parents but that didn't happen, and let each of them know they're not welcome in or around my house any more. At this point I had no idea about where they did this or any other details. My son decided that he was going to sleep it off. The next day I came home from work and found out that the police wanted to talk to me since I had keys to this establishment that's tied to our family. I asked why and was then told that someone entered, partied, and then tried to break into the safes. I was quickly able to put two and two together, told my father who is in charge of this establishment to call the police back, and went and spoke with police with my son and made him take accountability for his actions. My son's story is that he took my father's keys out of his vehicle, went and partied with his friends, came home after I dropped these kids off, and then snuck back out to \"finish cleaning up\" and that's when the attempt to rob the place happened. He also swore up and down that his friends had nothing to do with it. However, when the police were asking certain questions, he couldn't answer them, then changed his story at the end and said he did do those things they asked about. The police told me afterwards that they didn't believe my son had anything to do with trying to break into the safes. He couldn't answer any questions about it and then they tricked him with saying they had \"evidence\" that they didn't and when he all of a sudden changed his story and agreed, that's how they knew he had nothing to do with that part and was covering for someone. He was facing felony burglary, intent, and theft. The board of this establishment voted to not press formal charges because of who my son is, however he would have to pay restitution. He has a job, so he signed a formal agreement that they reserve the right to press those charges if he doesn't pay. The formal agreement was my idea in order to hold him accountable. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday, police call me at 7pm to tell me that they believe my son has information on a new burglary but they knew he wasn't involved. I told the police that my son spends the weekend with his father and they agreed to meet me over there to talk to him. Not one, but three businesses in that area were broken into, 10s of thousands of dollars worth of damage to each place was done, and things were missing from one of the other businesses. The establishment that is tied to my family was one of them that was broken into again yesterday. However, it was very different and shot red flags up all over the place. This place has been broken into in the past, but this time almost mirrored earlier this week when my son entered with keys. The place was trashed, an attempt was made to get into the safes again, and whoever this was \"partied,\" and left their beer cans all over the place. My son's whereabouts could be accounted for from 8am to right then and there, plus police said they knew he wasn't involved but that maybe he knew who was and wanted him to watch surveillance to see if he recognized someone. He said he did not recognize the person in the photo they showed him. No face was shown, you only see a young kid wearing a jacket and police were hoping that maybe my son would recognize the jacket and the shoes. He told me this afternoon that he swears he didn't recognize it but is starting to wonder if two of his friends were involved and his highly suspicious of them right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt doesn't end there. I get a phone call today from his boss. She was one of my closest friends and owns a gas station. I was her son's teacher last year too. When she was looking for some extra help, I offered my son. He was hired on the spot and he was extremely happy about it. He had wanted his own job for a while and I was sincerely hoping that maybe it would make a difference with some of the things he had been doing, as well as keeping him away from the people he shouldn't be with. I was physically sick when she told me that she has my son on video pocketing money while on his shift. I was mortified, but this isn't about me. I call my son and his explanation was that he had sex with a girl and thought she could get pregnant and needed to buy Plan B. I couldn't even figure out how in the world this even happened and then he tells me that his father allowed this girl to come over and STAY THE ENTIRE WEEKEND last weekend. No supervision, no anything. In fact, his father even knew that they were SHOWERING together one morning. I was livid to say the least. I also believe it's safe to assume that he will be losing his job, which then means that he can not pay the restitution for the burglary, and therefore will end up in jail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPart of me wants that to be what happens so he gets away from all of these kids that he shouldn't hang around within learns that there are consequences for his actions. The reason I say that is because there has been a significant change since that started. His old friends don't hang around with him anymore, he barely goes to school, or he just skips whenever he feels like it, he is doing things that are just so out of character for him that I can't even wrap my head around it. I am beyond shocked, mortified, embarrassed, scared, mad, upset, every emotion anyone can think of. I have had multiple meetings with the school, per my request, regarding how he's not being held accountable for walking in and out of the building whenever he feels like it. They didn't even know! I pulled up his PowerSchool account and had to show them myself. I have reached out to his doctor to ask about counseling resources only to be told that \"there aren't many options in the area.\" I went back to the school and all their resources are \"full.\" What do I do? Other than quitting my job, which I absolutely can not really do at the moment, and making sure that I am with him 24/7, what do I do? I feel like I am going absolutely crazy over this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

One of kids that caught them (looked over into the cubicle) started rumors it was a lot more and of course both of them became very upset especially the girl which is totally understandable. This school is very small conservative school so I am expecting call today and there will be consequences.\n\nWhat we are struggling with is how to support him without causing longterm damage or shame. We live in sex post home, there has been and continue to be open honest age appropriate conversations we have had lots of discussions about legal age, consent, safe sex, and open about puberty changes that occur, we have been clear about ramifications of your actions with things like sexting etc. no topic is off table except we never discuss person experiences.\n\nHe is absolutely beside himself he is school leader and very kind sweet boy, we get the appeal of an older girl that shows interest and has previous experience. We have suggested to him a girlfriend at school is very distracting and it is our preference he doesn\u2019t have a girlfriend at school. We have agreed moving forward he is to share with us if he is seeing a girl and we would like to know who it is. We have also said school is off limits for behaviors like that and we have gone over the reasons and potential issues especially with phones in everyone pockets. We have re enforced at his age holding hands and kissing is acceptable but not at school. These conversations were open and calm and he understands.\n\nWe think back to his age and what we were getting up too. Also mindful of how events like this can shape your views moving forward so don\u2019t want to shame him or cause trauma for him moving forward. He is worried he will be suspended and the teachers will view him differently, he was open and cooperative with teachers when questioned yesterday. We have reassured him that he has made an error of judgment, we have told him of course he wants to grow up and experience things with girls that is totally normal and natural but don\u2019t be do quick to grow up. We have encouraged him to own it he made an error of judgment behaving like that at school but is normal to want to be with girls in that way.

Last year, he wanted to know why everyone finds the number \"69\" so funny on YouTube- and so we told him, in an ahe appropriate answer, via text, per our agreement. \n\nHe's well aware that his father and i have access to, and will sometimes check his devices and that he has no right to total privacy on those devices for his own safety. I'm a retired police officer and we've had PLENTY of talks about being safe online. \n\nIt's been years since we've come across anything on his devices that wasn't okay. (Around age 8, there was some searching for body parts/ inappropriate topics- he very quickly came across some hardcore images, we immediately addressed it with a family discussion, much tighter parental restrictions on his devices to keep him safe, and provided plenty of support because he was WAY too young to have been seeing that stuff and was quite upset by it. I felt we handled that really well, and while i wish he hadn't seen it, I feel like there was no permenant lasting damage)\n\nWe have always had very open discussions regarding sex and sexuality. He understands both male and female systems, knows all the appropriate body parts, and was well informed about the ivf process that brought his younger sibling into the world- we've always kept it age appropriate, but sex has never been a secretive thing, and we have touched on all the important topics about both sex and bodies, and staying safe online. \n\nBut we've run into an issue and I'm not sure how to address it AT ALL. \n\nThis past month, he had to be up early in the am for camp, and sometimes, he was not following through on all of his responsibilities - like packing his bag for camp, sometimes he was staying up too late, etc- so one night when we were out late we checked his ipad to be sure that he had actually gone to bed by 9. \n\nIn opening his iPad - we did find out that he'd shut it down around 9pm, and were happy-  but the conversation he'd been having with his 13 year old friend from another state was right in front of our faces.  \n\nIn the conversation- the other boy is expressing interest in our son and \"asking him out\" to \"be his boyfriend\". It's clear that several of the friends in thier friend group have been pushing our son to reciprocate the kid's interest in him. There was some back and forth between my son and this kid, in so much as there were occasional inappropriate comments about gay sex - it seems more like our son is just going along with what the other kid has been saying, but he's also not super chatty, so it's hard to tell. \n\nHere's the main issue -  \n\nIf our son is possibly gay/bi - i couldn't possibly care less, in so much at that he'll be fully supported no matter what. \n\nHis entire life, when we've referenced his future, we've always said \"when you grow up, if you get married to someone\" or \"when you have a girlfriend or boyfriend someday\" - we've been very clear that we're 100% okay with whomever he has an interest in. We have many gay and trans friends that he's known growing up, and he's well aware that we will support him no matter what and that whatever makes him happy is fine by us! \n\nThe end of thier most recent conversation was literally this boy asking our son if he'd like to \"go out\" on a virtual \"date\" with him some time. \n\nCLEARLY I'm not okay with there being sexually inappropriate conversations between our son and anyone. He's too young. Not to mention that this kid is someone he's video chatted with when i was present - So i can confirm that he's a child also - but he is a child that we don't really KNOW. He's a friend of a friend that he's been gaming with online for years. \n\nSo how do we go about addressing the CONTENT of the conversations as being inappropriate without making him feel like we're coming down on him because this is a BOY and not a girl? Because, honestly, I'd feel EXACTLY the same if he was having the same conversations with a girl. I don't care about the child like \"do you like me/i like you\" stuff. It's only the sexual bits of conversation that i have a problem with. \n\nI don't want to discourage him from developing a crush, or feelings for someone-that's perfectly normal-  but if he's just going along with this kid not to hurt his feelings- i want to make my son aware that he doesn't HAVE to have an interest in this kid just because his other friends are encouraging them to \"be together\".\n\nI just want to be CLEAR with him, that the problem is the sexual content of their back-and-forth and NOT the gender of the person he may or may not have feelings for. \n\nIn earlier conversations, it seems that any time my son was asked about being straight vs gay, he didn't seem like he wanted to answer- even when the other boy was making it very clear he was interested. This makes me concerned that my son ISN'T interested and that he may very well be straight, but with his entire friend group pushing this narrative and \"shipping\" the two of them together- I want my son to know that it's okay for him to say \"I'm sorry I'm not interested in being more than your friend\" and I ESPECIALLY don't want him being coerced into having sexual conversations that don't even align with how he feels. \n\nI'm just not sure how to have this conversation without outright asking him \"are you really interested in boys/this kid or are you just going along with what your friends want?\" I don't want my son to feel like he HAS to determine his sexuality at 12 - gay, straight, bi- or anything in between any of those (or even none of those!). \n\nI just want to be sure that i handle this with care, so i don't make my son feel like there's ANY issue with who he is as a person or who he might have feelings for-  while still putting my foot down as a parent that he's not to be having sexualized conversations with people online at 12. \n\nI just don't know if my son really has any interest in this kid (or really, anyone for that matter)- he's still really young for any of this. \nWe're very close, but he's never expressed a ANY interest in anyone except a little girl a few years back that he would blush around and get flustered around because he very clearly thought she was cute(and said as much. I just want to make sure he's not being PRESSURED by his friend group. ( Bc there are MULTIPLE texts from both boys and girls in thier friend group, telling him he should \"go out\" with this boy, telling him that this boy really likes him and asking if he likes the kid back- to which my son had replied \"i dunno\" and \"idk\" every time)..\n\nWe did take him off his chat programs the other day because he'd not put his wet bathing suit away and that was the predetermined punishment- but he's supposed to get the programs back within a few days and i need to talk to him about this before he's back on there, and this kid is expecting an answer from him. \n\nPlease help!  Your advice / suggestions and perspectives are VERY much appreciated. I'd especially like to hear from LGBTQIA+ parents/adults who could help me with how to separate how to draw a hard line about what's okay- without making him feel judged.",

        "content": "Delete if not allowed. Just need advice. I know it\u2019s long but this is serious advice. I\u2019m at a complete loss and idk what to do. \n \nSo I have 234 screenshots of texts from my daughters father (we are not together and haven\u2019t been since October) cussing me like a dog, refusing to see her, claiming she wasn\u2019t his, and then threatening to take her from me if I don\u2019t let him get in my pants (to say it nicely). I have completely cut contact with him because he began cussing me and threatening me with a custody battle as well as posting horrible things about me, calling the police and saying I abuse my daughter (they showed up at my house at 1:15 am and I had to wake up my 7 month old daughter and take her pajamas off of her to show them she didn\u2019t have bruises on her and let them search my house for drugs and alcohol when I don\u2019t do drugs and never have and I don\u2019t drink anymore) because I told him I went to a birthday party for my friends daughter and my ex (who has done more for my daughter than her father has and has never done anything bad his entire life) was there. I then told him (after a full on meltdown from him over my ex being at a mutual friends daughters birthday party and him saying that me refusing sex makes him think I\u2019m sleeping with my ex when I haven\u2019t slept with anyone other than my child\u2019s father since I got pregnant) that I was going to be speaking with attorneys to try to retain one to get supervised visitation only. I have since cut all contact and had to report hun to the police not once, not twice, but 4 times in the last 36 hours. He is $495 behind on his child support (a little over a month of payments) and is refusing to pay any more. He won\u2019t stop posting things all over Facebook about me telling people I abuse my daughter and neglect her and that she is skin and bones and is severely under developed, can\u2019t roll over or sit up in her own, (she sits up on her own, rolls over from back to stomach and vice versa, and is pulling herself into a standing position now and weighs almost 18 pounds at 7 months old) and that I only give her a bottle three times a day and that I am on drugs and drinking heavily and all kinds of other horrible things. \n\nAfter speaking with 3 attorneys I was given the following options. \nOption A: take him to court and have what little rights he has (to a custody trial and visitation solely based on an affidavit of parentage because he didn\u2019t sign her birth certificate and had to sign that for child support) and let it be over and done with once and for all. I can continue to keep communication completely cut off until a decision is made in court. \n\nOption B: wait and see if he tries to take me to court for partial or full custody. At which time my attorney (who I did retain as of today) will present every single one of the screenshots, police reports (including the reports I made before our daughter was born and before I got pregnant as well as the ones resulting in charges that he was arrested for and were dropped because I was in the hospital due to complications with my pregnancy and couldn\u2019t be in court), and witness statements and testimonies including one from our child support caseworker, my mother, my grandparents, my sister and my brother, my friends, and some of his friends as to his abuse and neglect of myself and our daughter. \n\nSo my question to you guys is. Which one do I do? I know he doesn\u2019t have the money for an attorney and neither does anyone in his family and I know I can take him down in court because he lives with a felon who has child abuse and child neglect charges and he sells and does drugs and has charges for drug use and possession. I know I can beat him in court but I don\u2019t know if I should make the first move or continue to keep communication cut completely until he makes a move. \n\nWhat do you guys think\u2026?\n\nAnd before anyone says anything rude, yes my child cries. Yes my child bumps her head every now and then when she rolls over to fast or when she looses her balance. She is 7 months old and is learning to sit up and push herself into her hands and knees by herself. She is learning to crawl and stand herself up on things. So yes she gets tiny bumps. She has stomach problems due to lactose intolerance and gastric issues I am still in the process of getting figured out after thousands of dollars in medical bills that I have paid off despite being the only financial support she has. I still make it work. She has new clothes that fit because of me and my parents. Diapers wipes formula bottles toys shoes clothes medicine a safe warm place to sleep. All because of me and my parents. I work 40 hours a week and he doesn\u2019t even have a job. I leave work early or go in late every single time she has a doctors appointment or gets sick and he has been to 3 appointments her entire life. I make bottles, change diapers, deal with temper tantrums. I\u2019ve been head butted in the nose so hard she legitimately fractured my nose because of a temper tantrum over me taking a toy away from her in Walmart because she wasn\u2019t supposed to have it. He doesn\u2019t even know how to make a bottle and she cries every time he changes her diaper cause he jerks her around like a toy and is WAY to rough. The only things he\u2019s ever gotten her were diapers she was allergic to, wipes she was allergic to (which he used on her without me knowing after I told him she was allergic because he didn\u2019t believe me and she had a diaper rash for a week), and hand me down clothes from friends that were either 3T and 4T clothes that she won\u2019t be able to wear for years when she was a month old or premie clothes when she was 5 months old and in 3-6 month clothes. She\u2019s 7 months old wearing 12 month pants and bathing suits and 9 month sleepers and he brought her 0-3 month pants and a 24 month sleeper, and a 3T nightgown and pj set a week ago. He knows what size she wears but won\u2019t actually buy her anything that fits. So just a bit more info for anyone who needs it to make a decision.",

I\u2019m a SAHM. \n\nWhen we just had our 4yo it was a cakewalk. Extremely easy and fun. Now that our 11 week old is here it\u2019s so extremely hard. Just until 1 week ago my baby is waking up every 3 hours sometimes 4. But before that she was up every 1-2 hours to nurse. So I\u2019ll also burp her and hold her elevated for 20 minutes and change her diaper. So every time she wakes up I\u2019m basically awake for an hour. I EBF. It\u2019s safe to say I don\u2019t sleep. During the day she\u2019ll nurse every 2 hours. I\u2019m holding my baby all day and all night it feels like because I also do the same routine during the day. My fianc\u00e9 occasionally will change a diaper. But only when I ask. He\u2019ll only hold if I ask. He\u2019ll only do anything if I ask him to. \n\nHe works out every day after work so I\u2019m alone with the 2 kids all day and night. He will help for the bedtime routine tho. \n\nI\u2019m so desperate for sleep it feels like a joke to me at this point. Thinking about it I laughing because how does this happen. I feel like ny family has a meeting without me to schedule times for everyone to wake me up in the middle of the night to make sure I get no sleep. For example, I feed the baby from 9pm-9:30 and will put her to bed. My 4yo wants me to sit with him while he falls asleep 9:30-10pm. I finally get to lay down and instantly fall asleep. My fianc\u00e9 is on his phone relaxing and once he\u2019s done he\u2019ll wake me up wanting to have sex at around 11 or 11:30. My baby wakes up for her next feed at 1am. I finally put her down at 1:45 and my 4yo wakes up at 2 crying wanting me to sit with him again. He\u2019ll calm down at 3 am.  Then the dog starts barking like crazy wanting to pee even tho he went out right before bed. By that point it\u2019s time for baby\u2019s next feed. \n\nIt\u2019s completely insanity. Then my 4yo wakes up at 8am. Guess who\u2019s going downstairs with both kids and cooks breakfast? Me. When I tell my fianc\u00e9 no to sex he gets so angry and makes me feel so guilty that I never initiate sex even tho I\u2019ve explained all this to him. I\u2019m exhausted. But I\u2019m scared he\u2019ll leave me because of no sex like how I saw a recent post on r/marriage. I do want to clarify he does help. But I have to ask for every single thing like a teenager at that point I might as well do it because he just looks annoyed at me. Idk what to do\n\n\nTLDR: I sleep a total of maybe 2 hours a night and do majority of child care all week with no breaks 24/7. I\u2019m expected to still have sex with fianc\u00e9 or else I\u2019m being made to feel extremely guilty and bad. I feel like our relationship is falling apart",

We have been dating for almost 3 years. And for about the last three months, he consistently just tells me he\u2019s gonna move out or get a new apartment or take our toddler, because I am mentally unstable and obviously wouldn\u2019t be able to take care of a child. Well we\u2019re on a vacation right now with my grandparents. And he threatened to turn the car around multiple times simply because I fell asleep or I wasn\u2019t responding or I mean I was just trying to not be the problem! Lol I made it to work destinations. And it has been a constant constant string of him telling me all I do is behave like a child and he just wants to leave and he\u2019s leaving in the morning and he\u2019s taking our toddler. And it got so bad about an hour ago that he told my nine-year-old about my suicide attempt. He told my nine-year-old that I was a sugar baby. He told me nine-year-old alternative heartbreaking things simply because I reiterated to him you were threatened to leave me multiple times and he had keys in his hand and my Oldest son was crying asking him not to leave. And my partner, then stated, why would I ever leave my son pointing at the toddler. My oldest started hysterically bawling, obviously heartbroken. He spent the last year and a half building a bond with this man that he\u2019s known since birth, and he almost considers him closer than his father. as my oldest started crying my partner literally laughed said I cannot take this anymore and went to bed. And then had to calm her toddler at 12:30 at night and hold my oldest because he is absolutely petrified. Is this normal behavior? I mean he\u2019s known me since high school he watched me go through all of my diagnoses  AND ALL, OR I SHOULD SAY, BOTH OF MY EXTREMELY ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS! feel like this is just unfair. I never hit anything from him! And now he says I\u2019m his shackle and his ball and chain, because he knows if he leaves me I am mentally unstable and he told the oldest I will go hurt myself. I have lost about 50 pounds in the past three months. I just feel like a complete failure. I have two jobs I take care of the home. I am very grateful for him working so hard for us. He has never once put a child or toddler to bed, he has never once woken up with him in the middle of the night. He has never once really had to care for him and get himself ready ever! I always handle that. Yeah, he turns around to my older son and tells him I am a child and his ball and chain and shackle. coming from a background of unstable mental health that does make you. Wonder if you\u2019re the problem. This is a SOS. Please please help me and I\u2019m sure some of you I just need to leave but I have nothing to leave with. He had me sell the vehicle. I had my first got together. Yes it was damaged and then he had me start driving his car but I without him I have nothing, I\u2019m starting a secret bank account and I\u2019m trying to do the best that I can but I just want him to love me I just wanna make him happy as when I get my family together. AM I PATHETIC?\n\nAlso we have sex like freaky sex atleast 4 times a week\u2026.  \n\nTl;dr can a safely medicated bi polar type 2 person be loved? Be a parent? Am I being abused?",

        "content": "My ex (34m) and I (34f) (married in 2018) were just divorced at the end of June. We have a 4 year old daughter together. Our divorce took 1.5 years. The only dispute in the entire divorce was whether he would be able to drink around my daughter. He refused to sign the agreement unless I agreed to allow him 2 8 oz glasses of beers or 2 6 oz glasses of wine during his entire parenting time (3 overnights every other week). He has an admitted history of substance abuse issues (alcoholic, pain pills in the past, probably other stuff now). \n\nThis past weekend my daughter came home from her dad\u2019s saying things like \u201cwhy did daddy push me out of bed for the girl\u201d \u201cthe girl and me slept in the bed\u201d \u201cI slept on the floor on my blanket next to daddy and the girl\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve raised concerns in the past with him regarding my daughter\u2019s sleeping arrangements. He currently lives in an unattached garage that doesn\u2019t have a tub/shower and he does not have a bed or even a mattress for my daughter. This has been an issue since we separated in 2021.\n\nThere is no reason for him not to buy her a bed, because he is $10,000 behind in child support since we split finances and he got a check for half of my house that I purchased prior to marriage (that he didn\u2019t contribute financially to) and half of my 401k (he didn\u2019t have his own). It was almost $200,000.\n\nI just found out from his friends that he is dating a woman (for about a month) who has a serious history of substance abuse issues and was out of control for a long period of time a few years ago. They think she is sober right now. I\u2019m so happy he is dating (anything to take the focus off of me) but this feels like a bomb waiting to go off. \n\nMy ex has a history of violence towards me which my daughter has witnessed, has tried to strangle me, shot an assault rifle off in my home while I was pregnant, and had serious issues with sexual boundaries. The police were never called. I have a pretty deep history of childhood trauma, so it is what it is. There is still a bullet hole in my wall.\n\nHis friends also told me that they\u2019ve had to stop talking to my ex because they were witnessing him behave poorly towards my daughter so often. I had three separate adults tell me that he is a bad father over the weekend.\n\nI asked him to please stop co-sleeping and that I was uncomfortable with him even introducing our young daughter to dates so early. I asked for one year of no dating in front of our daughter because of his history of violence\u2026 but he told me he can do whatever he wants and to talk to my attorney. I tried to reach out to his family for help, thinking maybe someone would talk to him but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get anywhere. They are huge enablers even though they know the whole truth. I\u2019ve contacted my attorney and she said it\u2019s absolutely not ok and I guess his attorney is going to tell him to stop. I really don\u2019t think he will.\n\nWhat else can I do to keep my baby safe besides document it all? It feels awful sending my daughter there knowing especially now that she might be hearing or seeing them have sex. He has very, very little boundaries in that area. She\u2019s only 4yo but she remembers events (like daddy hitting mommy) that happened when she was 1yo so I have no doubt this will stay with her.",

She told me she found out that her dad and his wife are pregnant and have their first appointment soon (she saw ultrasound appointment on their calendar and questioned it).\n\nShe has a little half sister (6F) at my house and let me tell, they fight a lot but like normal sisters do. She likes going to her dad's because she is the only kid there. It makes sense why she is upset. However, what she kept repeating was that she doesn't want anymore younger siblings, not from me or her dad.\n\nThis leads to the current problem, my husband and I are about 6-6.5 weeks pregnant and I was waiting to tell people at 12 weeks. I'm wondering if I should just rip the bandaid now so she can process this all at once or still wait the 12 weeks and open up what might be a healed wound by then?\n\nMy daughter does have a therapist and I'll be scheduling an appointment for this week for her to talk it out with the therapist.\n\n**Edit:** Hi! I just want to say thank you to thought who provided really helpful insight and advice. The echo was to talk to her therapist first and figure out the best course of action from there. She has an appointment tonight and I'll talk to her therapist tomorrow. Thanks again everyone!\n\n**Edit 2:** Me again! A lot of people are bringing up her dad and I separating but thought I'd add more context. Her dad and I were never together. We were young and hooking up and due to religious backgrounds and not having a good idea of safe sex, I became pregnant. He amazingly still wanted to be in the baby's life so we've been coparenting for 10 years.\n\nI also see a lot of comments on us using my 10 year old as a babysitter? I'm not sure where that idea came from but I would absolutely not pawn her younger siblings off on her to take care of. That's not cool\n\n**Edit 3:** It looks like I'm a bad at relaying all the information. Earlier this year, I asked my daughter if she'd ever be interested in a little sibling, she told me she'd love a little brother but it would just be cool to be a much older sibling. I felt comfortable starting to try having another kid with my husband due to this conversation. I don't think she was expecting her father to have a kid which is why she is upset. \n\nAlso, when I said she likes going to her dad's because she's the only kid there, I did not mean she prefers her dad's house and hates being at our house. She actually likes to stay at our house more than her dad's. She just liked the break from her little sister which is pretty normal for a tween! A lot of tweens don't get that break.",

        "content": "Tldr; I\u2019m pretty sure my brother is lying about being sexually active. How do we have a conversation with him about this and avoid any further lies?\n\nMy partner (32M) and I (24M) have had my 15 yr old brother in our care for the past year. We recently found out he has a girlfriend due to his completely unsuccessful attempts at hiding a hickey on his neck. We expressed that we were happy and excited for him, but I also sat him down and asked if they had gone any further. He said no, and that he doesn\u2019t think they\u2019ll be ready for sex anytime soon. Fast forward a week and I find pubes on the toilet seat, obviously from trimming\u2026I sit with my partner and brother and ask which one of them it was from (already knowing it was not my partner\u2019s), and my brother acts confused until I say I know it\u2019s his. I tell him it\u2019s fine if he\u2019s just taking care of himself, but that the timing of now dating someone is causing some concern for me, as that might show he\u2019s wanting to become sexually active. He tells me he understands my concern, but that the hair was just bothering him. We let him know that we won\u2019t be upset and just want to make sure he\u2019s safe and he reassures us multiple times that they aren\u2019t ready for sex but that he\u2019ll come to us when he is. Yesterday though, he left to go hang out with his girlfriend, and my partner says he smelled his cologne on my brother. Then, a few mins later, he tells me that he\u2019s pretty sure there are condoms missing. I almost called him to tell him to bring himself and his girlfriend back here so that we could confront them literally just to make sure they\u2019re using protection properly and understand the potential consequences, as well as how to respect each others boundaries and such. We didn\u2019t do that\u2026but almost did. I don\u2019t want to confront my brother in any way that will push him away or cause him to lie any further, but it reeaaally seems like he\u2019s lying to our faces about being sexually active. Please give us any advice or experiences you have!",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Honestly, it sounds like he is being at least someone considerate (trimming and smelling nice) and safe (condoms). So why does he NEED to tell you if he is having sex? Can you just tell him whatever you planned to tell him about sex/boundaries etc without him having to expose his sex life? Maybe under the guise of \"I know you said your not ready for sex, but I imagine you will be at some point so here's what you need to know\".\n\nI dont really think you're entitled to know weather or not he is having sex.",

        "content": "When I was younger my mom would randomly search through my phone which to this day has damaged our releationship. Although I never gave her any reason to search through my phone, she was strict and wanted to anyways. Maybe she felt it in her gut that I was being groomed by adults as a child (obviously I didn't see how it was wrong because she never explained it), but thats not the stuff she found instead she grounded me and yelled at me for cussing to my friends over text messages. The things that can hurt your children are usually the hardest things to find on a phone... the programs are just set up that way. Big tech companies admit to setting up the systems like that along with admitting they know everything about you from your phone (that's how they market things to you), so if you are going to search through your childs phone simply don't get them one. It's comparable to giving a kid a dairy with the intent of reading it... its snooping. If you are going to snoop tell them from the get go, and instead of letting them give you reasons to snoop prevent them in the first place. If your kid is old enough for a phone, they're old enough to understand the real dangers of the world and specifically the internet. Talk to them about grooming, drugs, sex and other things you don't agree with in general. If you can't put trust in your kids don't expect them to put trust in you. If you plan to search their phone let them know before buying one and if you didn't orginally plan to snoop explain as in-depth as you can why you need to. Don't punish them for the mistakes they made, you are responsible for that... they're children and if they're doing things they shouldn't it's because you didn't educate them properly on whatever they are lying about. If they're not old enough to understand then they are not old enough to have a phone, simple as that. If you snoop and break their trust, THEY WILL, I REPEAT THEY WILL FIND A WAY TO HIDE THE THINGS THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW. The cussing and watching a movie you don't approved of will seem minuscule when they turn to drugs and shady influences because they don't feel that they have a safe outlet to communicate.

        "title": "I need help navigating my sons bullying situation.",
        "content": "My son is being bullied at school and I feel like they're not handling it properly. I'm not sure what exactly to do.\n\nAt the beginning of this school year there was an incident on the bus on the way to school. There was a girl who wouldn't leave my son alone. I don't think it started out as malicious or anything but she was so close to him and he was uncomfortable. He tried to turn away from her and whacked his head hard on the window. When he got to school he went straight to the nurses office, I was called and picked him up. No serious injury, no signs of concussion but he came home and we monitored him to be on the safe side. The bus driver called me later that day and said she reviewed the tape and saw exactly what happened. She spoke with the girls parents and let them know the situation and assured me that they would be separated to ensure nothing else would happen.\n\nUp until now there have been some comments made to my son by the girl, while in class and not on the bus. The main one is her making comments about his physical appearance (buck teeth). He has told his teacher and other adults but says nothing actually happens. Like they tell her to stop by don't actually follow through and make sure the bullying has stopped. Only the bus incident was reported to me by the school, nothing that happens during school hours has been brought up to me by anyone other than my son. It's gotten to the point where he's trying so hard to be her friend so that she'll hopefully stop picking on him. \n\nNow on to the current issue.\nA few weeks ago (which his dad and I just found out about 2-3 days ago) there was another incident on the bus. My understanding is still not 100% clear as I still haven't talked to anyone from the school. But from what I heard my son was sitting with another boy, but his bully was sitting near them. This kid tells my son he should pretend to have sex (aka dry hump) with the boy he's sitting with. He knew it was inappropriate and that he shouldn't do it. But also he just wanted her to like him so she'd stop being mean to him. He figured if he just did it, that maybe she'd be nicer to him. Another student saw it and told them to stop and got the bus driver involved. Tapes were reviewed, school was notified. And since it was a simulated sexual act they called social services. So we found out about all of this a few days ago when a social worker knocked on my exs door, not when it happened and the school was informed. 3 weeks between them knowing and when we were told about it by NOT the school.\n\nI really don't know what to do here. I have so many problems with this situation, but the first that came to mind was that from September they weren't supposed to be near each other on the bus, and if they had followed through with it then this new thing wouldn't have ever happened. And why has no one done anything about the multiple times he's reported to a teacher about the bullying in class from September til now? Like maybe a meeting between myself, sons dad, and the girls parents so we could try to figure out why this is going on. \n\nI looked up the laws in my state on bullying and what the schools policies and responsibilities, and they're supposed to have documentation of everything reported to them. Can I ask the school for copies of all the documents they have involving my sons bullying reports? My ex has been playing phone tag with the schools safety and support supervisor, but to our knowledge they didn't try to contact us until after we got the visit from a social worker. I feel like they should have called us the day it happened, not 3 weeks later by someone not affiliated with the school.\n\nMy son has only ever gone to this school but next year we're not just changing schools, we're going to a different district. I don't want to take him away from his friends, but I also can't let him keep going to a school where he doesn't feel safe. He specifically said he doesn't feel safe at school and I feel so bad. School was my safe place growing up and I hate that he doesn't want to go because one kid refuses to leave him alone and it seems like the school doesn't follow through to stop it from continuing.\n\nOne thing that was brought up to us, should we think about talking to a lawyer? I don't want it to go that far, but I'm going to make sure this isn't happening to him anymore and I don't know what to do.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "The first thing you mentioned , she was trying to talk to him and he yanked his head away and slammed his own head on the window, that isn't bullying . Young kids are learning boundaries. I teach kindergarten, and kids are constantly getting up in other kids faces. This happens all day, every day. \n\nWith the sex act, you have no clue if the girl said to pretend to do that sexual act. Bus video cameras often have shoddy audio, and with how loud a bus is, you surely aren't going to hear a conversation between two kids .",

He's had some body-image issues over the years and has experienced heartbreaks from rejections by crushes and girls he finally got the nerve up to ask out.  \n\nSo now, at last, he's found happiness with a high school sweetheart. They've been together about 6 weeks or a couple months. It's awesome.\n\nHe has a basement bedroom, and I've never had trouble letting them hang out together down there. Maybe I shouldn't allow it, but that doesn't seem reasonable to me.\n\nLast night, I could hear them having sex down there. I shouldn't be surprised, and I suppose I wasn't, but it was a bit jarring. I'm something of a traditional parent but not hardcore that way. And to be totally honest, there's definitely a part of me that's happy he's getting this experience. I lost my virginity at 18, and I think he's ready for it. \n\nStill, he's living with me and in high school,   and I want to be a responsible parent, not just have an attitude that anything goes around here. I don't think I'd be okay with it if he were 17, almost certainly not if 16, definitely not if 15, etc. \n\nDo I just let it go and not say anything?

Shortly after I posted the previous post, my parents showed up at my house and I was forced to talk to them. I told them all my grievances, and they said they understood and would made attempts to change things. \n\nOf course that did not last long. Since then (and especially since Covid/ political beliefs being emboldened), they've become more judgmental, awful than previously. I've grown up hearing the \"N\" word regularly. For a short time in my early years, I thought it was even normal. Once I was old enough to understand, I quickly changed that though. I am absolutely disgusted with it now. But now, they use that word pretty frequently, along with other slurs. My dad will use every slur in the book when same sex couples are shown in TV, and turn whatever is on off. I've told them to stop, tried educating them, but they are set in their ways. My daughter is...well, she is not straight, and not gender conforming (which she is exploring and not sure of yet, so we still use female pronouns). Of course O hadn't told them this, and I can only imagine what my parents would say to her. This is one of the reason I have cut ties again. However, most of my family believes as they do, so I am the odd one out, and treated as a bad person for this. \n\nTheir comments about the way I chose to live (non-drinking, non-smoking, no drugs, and not meat eating) had gotten so much worse, despite me telling them how much it hurts. I am not pushy with my beliefs as they work for me, but not everyone else. One time when I had a friend over at their house to swim in their pool, and my mom made drinks for the friend since they do drink. My mom proceeded to get them plastered, and constantly told them \"they were they daughter they never had\" because they will drink with my mom. I felt...non existent. Like I was not good enough to be considered their daughter. Of course my mom thought there was nothing wrong with her comment, and laughed about it. Editing to add- I just realized this was in the original post, but it's happened more than once. \n\nThey still never made attempts to come to our house, but would go to my other sisters all the time. They actually went to visit my aunt in South Carolina (we are in Ohio) more than they came to my house for a few years. \n\nDuring the height of Covid, they were still attending large get togethers, especially for holidays. My dad's mom died from Covid during this time. I wanted to play it safe and stayed home during some holiday get togethers, but my parents berated me for this, and told me I was being too sensitive and paranoid. Also...my dad has cancer. They were being careless and I couldn't live with myself if I had given him Covid.\n\nThe thing that made me cut ties again with them was right before Easter of last year. The Friday before Easter, I got a migraine that sent me to the ER. I had never had one like that before, and was terrified. I was given medications, and sent home. I still felt absolutely awful, and slept/ hid in a dark room. I told my mom all of this. She did not ask how I was all weekend, and when Easter came around, she texts O about how she was disappointed we were not there, and making me feel bad for staying home. She didn't even text me, just O. I was incredibly hurt that I couldn't even try to feel better at home without them using it against me. Something in me broke over this. \n\nThere's so much I could go on and on about. All I have ever wanted was for my family to be close, and I tried so hard so do that. I can't deal with their negativity, judgment, and being treated so much worse than everyone else. The only time they have been \"proud\" of me was it came to my art- I am a fine artist, and have been getting a lot of recognition for it. My mom would share my art on her social media about how \"proud she was about my talent,\" but it felt more like she just wanted to show it off to get comments for herself. \n\nLast weekend, my parents got ahold of O's father (who they never talk to either), and went to his house during his weekend with her (which is farther away from them than I was) to see O. I've never not allowed them to see O. They have picked her up to hang out at their house as recently as a few weeks ago! But they acted like I was withholding her from them! \n\nI am viewed as the worse person in the world by my whole family. No one will talk to me because my parents have made me out to be the bad person. What should I do at this point? My heart hurts so bad, and I really do feel alone. But I do not want to be treated they way they do, and they will never stop. I loves her grandparents and I don't want to keep her from them, but I feel like no matter what I do, they use it as a way to make me seem like just the awful daughter.",

I also teach my kids it\u2019s my job to keep them safe, therefore on occasion i will check their SM apps.  \n\non my sons Insta i\u2019ve found bra pics and flirty messages about a month ago.    i told him it was inappropriate and to please delete it.  we talked about right/wrong etc. online presence, we have open conversation about sex/drugs/politics/ you name it. so i\u2019m comfortable with any topic.   i try to keep it age appropriate and this time the conversation was a little more \u201cadult\u201d\n\n\ni took the phone and told him , I do not want to embarrass or shame you but your conversations are unacceptable and inappropriate .   i don\u2019t want you to have expectations that this is what a healthy relationship looks like.  not just the photos, but also the girl who is demanding you text her back (while u had dinner w the family and sent 100 bipolar messages after he fell asleep without saying gn )   \n\nI explained although I didn\u2019t like the girl sending him photos I couldn\u2019t control her and i\u2019m not her parent.  so therefore it\u2019s my job to teach him how to respond to those types of situations and advances including not soliciting them. \n\ni basically told him i wanted him to be proud or at least not ashamed or embarrassed about anything he does online if a 3rd party were to see it.  \n\n\ni took the phone with telling him he\u2019s just going on a detox of his SM and i don\u2019t have the intention of restricting him completely because i don\u2019t want him to still do it and just hide it.    \n\ni kept emphasizing trust, and open conversation.  i was calm, not yelling, I was asking for his opinion because I told him this wasn\u2019t a lecture. I wanted it to be a conversation.   \n\ni ended it with letting him know the conversation was not over, he suggested i \u201c keep checking my messages cause i knew it was wrong but i still did it \u201c  (which causes me to think about compulsive tendencies he has) \n\nso\u2026 tips, tricks, suggestions?  what\u2019s next?!? -_-",

        "content": "I hate to ask this here. But, A few weeks ago I was almost take after a late night of finishing some computer work up at Starbucks. A few of you may know me and have heard my story but I will repeat it because its background information to my question. long story short: I was followed outside by a man who was with a group of men at Starbucks late at night (9:30pm). My car wasn't but 8 feet from the door but something didn't feel right so I made a hard u turn right back into Starbucks. After checking if he was still outside a few moments later I saw him standing by my car. I went to tell the baristas but when I was telling them the man came back in and the entire group left. we waited 10 minutes for a barista to walk me to my car and when we got to the door these men had parked a mini van by my car and four of them were outside between my car and there's and one man was in the drivers seat. I got to my car safely with the help of the barista and later filed a report. I've been notified that there is a gang of men that fit my description that are human sex traffickers. I'm shaken.\n If one thing had gone different. If I didn't listen to my gut I wouldn't be here. I cant prove that for a fact but I know deep down I would not be sitting here, in my home with my family. Simply because I wanted to study at Starbucks so my 2 year old could play at home. I'm scared. I know it doesn't matter but I always wear sweaters and pants, maybe occasionally on a hot day crusty jean shorts that come down to my knees. Its my fault for not changing my place of study and I am so thankful to God and those Baristas for ensuring I get another day to spend with my family. But I'm still terrified. these men are still out there. Now for the question. \nEveryone has different and strong feelings about guns. I've  never been a fan. My husband ( the red blooded American he is) loves guns and we had for for a while until his depression made it a little to tempting. He since then has not had a depressive flare up in the last 5 years. I cant even hold a gun without my hands going limp. I'm a healer through and through but these men were willing to take me away from my family for God knows what. Take me away from my kid for their own sick pleasure. I still have to finish school, I want to start a non profit and that means going out and fighting for my community at events which can take place at night. So that was a long winded explanation for, what do you guys think about a mom owning a gun and a ccw. If I did I would have it in a finger print safe that's bolted to the floor when at home. I would take all security precautions. I would feel safer with it. But theirs so many story's of children hurting themselves and or shooting others.\nI also have an insane mother in law who me and my family have restraining orders against who was just released form prison. She went in for murdering our two year old nephew and we currently have a two year old. She has made threats against me and this only makes me lean towards the idea of having a gun for protection.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "I would weigh the likelihood that you'll be able to get trained enough with a gun to viably use it as protection in the situations you're concerned about (think several men in a group - can you shoot all of them? you've been grabbed from behind - can you get to your gun and discharge it quickly enough in the right direction? etc.) against other options. Pepper spray can disable multiple targets at once and can be stored on your key ring. \n\nIf I had a family member who I thought could be a credible threat to my child, I would have a home security system with surveillance on all sides of my home (which we have anyway in a totally safe neighborhood because it's helpful to have that kind of visibility), and a large dog with a loud bark that would serve as a deterrent and be far more adept to reacting quickly to a threat than me running to a gun safe then trying to shoot at an assailant with no significant training (police, military, etc.).",

DNA results came back and he is mine. \n\nI took a lot of advice, so thank you - this is more updating you all and maybe more advice for the new situations that have popped up. \n\nI set up a proper meet up - it was supposed to be without kids, but I couldn't get anyone to watch my daughter. We've been having some new behaviours recently and no one wants to deal with them lol. \n\nAnywho, I guess because mine was coming, they brought theirs too. Its cool, went to a soft play place so the kids weren't around. Their have three older girls and a boy (my son?). They're pretty cool kids. \n\nI think my daughter traumatised them a little, but thats just life with her I guess. I didn't have a second for a reason, but here we are. \n\nAnyway, we spoke about their plans. You know, why they contacted me and need me in his life - he's five, and has managed fine without me prior. \n\nI explained that with my daughters needs I can't be a good parent to a second child, and it wouldn't be safe for me to look after them both without help. \n\nThey were understanding and agreed that I would struggle with the both of them. They then revealed that the reason they contacted me was because their son has some extreme behavioural issues too and were hoping I'd be able to help them with him. \n\nTo be honest he seemed really well behaved the entire time but maybe thats because he was running rabid lol. \n\nAnyway, we spoke about some of his behaviour and a lot of it is familiar. He's ver different from my daughter but the base traits are there. I offered to get them in touch with a therapist for him, you know, do all the leg work so they can get professional help with him. \n\nThey seem really hesistant, but asked to discuss it further at a later date. \n\nI still have no parental feelings towards him. I mean, it felt like I was just giving advice to friends more than talking about my own kid? \n\nI offered to pay child support which they shot down, so thats that I guess. His dad kept pushing for me to try and bond with him, but I'm really not sure how. \n\nI don't see how I can bond with him with my daughter around and I don't ever have anyone to watch her. My dad will watch her for like an hour at absolute most but thats very rare. \n\nThey accepted it but still seemed upset about it. We all went home, and then the DNA results were delivered yesterday. I haven't slept because I've been thinking about it so much. \n\nI don't know how to feel. Will I eventually love him like my daughter? He deserves better, I know. \n\nAnd, to top it off, my daughter has declared that she doesn't like him or his sisters so next time we see them its going to be so fun. I'm still working with her therapists on how to explain this to her. \n\nI feel so shitty for just not caring about him any more than I would a friends kid. And I know I can't just abandon my kid, because I'm not that shitty of a parent, but god. I don't know what to do. \n\nMy therapist is being amazing but even she's lost here. She doesn't have any answers. Which, fair. \n\nI think my best bet is trying to get into some form of family therapy, but I don't think they're gonna go for it. But I don't think there's any other options? Any recommendations welcome. I'll take anything at this point. \n\nWe still haven't figured out the whole name debacle yet, either.",

Let\u2019s  summarize and say that leading up to us living with each other she was exposed to tons that were not appropriate.\n\nShe\u2019s loves dressing \u201csexy\u201d. Today it was jeans, boots with small heels from an Elsa costume and a belly shirt. This outfit was not appropriate for the weather. Other days she wants to wear tights with no shorts even though her underwear shows. \n\nWhen it\u2019s a school day and I can blame the dress code, or the clothing is explicitly inappropriate, I will fight with her to change. But when it\u2019s an outfit like today\u2019s, which was basically just her belly button showing, I have a hard time articulating why she can\u2019t wear it and want to avoid turning her belly button into something to be ashamed about.\n\nI\u2019m really confused on how to handle the situation. My parents are really offended when she wears belly shirts. I am too, I get it. It\u2019s not just that her belly button is showing, it\u2019s her whole body language imitating the walk and attitude of an adult. She says she wants to be \u201csexy\u201d.\n\nIn therapy we\u2019ve danced around signs of sexual abuse, but the evaluations don\u2019t bring up anything concrete. It\u2019s not clear if she is just imitating what she saw her older, female cousins doing, or is struggling with something more serious.\n\nWe\u2019ve talked about what sex is (age appropriate and guided by a therapist) and how dressing sexy indicates to others that you\u2019re interested in sex and that it\u2019s not healthy or safe for kids to have sex. We confirmed that she is not interested in sex. \n\nIf she\u2019s feeling confident in her body,  and wearing outfits to harness that feeling, I don\u2019t want to take that away from her because it makes other people uncomfortable.\n\nOn the other hand if she\u2019s dressing this way because of some idea she\u2019s picked up that she needs to be sexually desirable in order to be valuable, am I reinforcing that idea by allowing her to play the role by dressing this way?\n\nWhat do I do?

Going through his bank transactions, he's spending a lot of money on restaurants with his gf or amazon, instead of saving for car payments or paying off his debt to his grandpa. \n\nI forgot something at home one day last week so I had to pop in real quick... and I found out that he's been showering with his gf at our place. Now, I'm not stupid- he is sexually active, he has condoms and (from what he says) she's on birth control pills... but the shower thing kinda irks me. We've spoken about it before, but in a \"if she has to work, can she shower here between school and work?\"... and my answer was no bc honestly, there's no need to really do it. They only work 3 hrs on school days. \n\nBut I'm not home. I have no idea when or if things are happening! I can't exactly say \"she's not allowed over\" when I'm not here bc I have no way to really prove that she isnt coming over. I feel ridiculous for \"punishing\" him for a shower, even though it's more than *just* a shower, ya know. \n\nAm i wrong for feeling... wrong, about them showering together? Like it's not needed, and it makes me uncomfortable knowing they did. But is that a \"me\" problem?\n\nThe car situations- I'm thinking of putting a gps on the car. It'll track milage, speed any accidents, as well as where it/he is. I really like the accident alert since sometimes idk if he got home safely, esp since he's a new driver and we're in the winter months... but he's also been talking about taking a road trip over the summer, just a few days- maybe go camping- and it'll be useful knowing where he is..\n\nOur hours are flipped. So he goes to school and work from 7am-7pm. I'm at work from 3p-3a. We do live with his grandpa, but he's nonconfrontational... which honestly, he shouldn't have to be, that's not his kid. But I know it makes grandpa uncomfortable knowing grandson is having sex (heard it once) and afaik, he's never been home when the kids are taking a shower together. \n\nI'm just not sure how to proceed with all this.

She was also miserable because she didn't feel comfortable being her usual rough and tumble kid during recess with a pad on.\n\nHer older sister, my 14 year old, has been using a Saalt cup she bought herself about 6 months ago and has been in her ear about how much she prefers it and how she can't believe she wasted so much time and effort on pads and tampons when she was younger, how much better it is to not worry about periods while at school, etc.\n\nI'm leaning toward giving her the head nod toward getting one as a \"you're growing up\" gift to try. \n\nI know they're supposed to be safe to use for anyone developed enough to be menstruating, and if she's comfortable enough to try one it should be her choice since it's her body, but I can't deny I'm feeling a little trepidation.  I know it isn't a sex thing, but the fact that she'd be literally inserting and removing things from her vagina at 10 is making my head explode a little bit. \n\nThis is a girl who still turns down the offer of bras because \"I don't like them and don't need them yet so no.\" despite her having noticable bumps under her clothes (wondering if this changes when warm weather comes).  It seems so out of sync for her to rush into a cup on her 3rd ever period as a 5th grader when she's still wrestling boys and very much acting like an elementary schooler. \n\nI also don't want to be the parent who denies body autonomy and tells her she has to wait, even though medically there's no reason she can't just because I have hangups.  It seems to be coming from an \"older sis says they're great and I know pads suck, so...\"\n\nAny other parents experienced their early adolescent wanting to try cups?",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "I remember older women sometimes saying that their mothers forbid/discouraged them from using tampons when they first became more available. Some of the reasoning behind that sounded similar to your worries. So no real advice but that is one framing that might help here. That it\u2019s not so different from a tampon. It\u2019s just relatively new to many of us. But also has she tried tampons? They might be a little more user friendly for her age while also solving for some of the problems pads bring.",

Do bear with my English as it is not my first language.\n\nI am a 41 years old mother and my daughter is 16. We are muslim and Islam kind of forbids teenagers from opposing sex to talk to each other. This is because 9 out of 10 times they are going to have some form of sex. (And I did hear horrible stories from the other mothers that I talked to)\n\nSo yesterday, as I am picking the laundry from her room, late at night, I notice that she is talking to a boy on the phone, I wasn\u2019t snooping its just that she was so bad at hiding it. I did not pick up what they were saying because I was going through the laundry, but I cloud tell it was a boy. She heard me going through the laundry and then she immediately ended the call. \n\nI asked her who was she talking to, and she said that it was her friend from school (our schools segregate boys from girls). I asked her to give me her phone, which she did but after turning it off. I told her that she would get it tomorrow after she wakes up.\n\nI do not know what to do from here and I do not want to keep the phone with me forever so I am asking you here, what should be my plan moving forward?\n\nNew Edit: \nI would like to thank everyone here for sharing their thoughts and I will try to answer your questions as follows:\n1- My children are all well educated in school and they have pretty good knowledge about safe sex practices but not in the full details as it is done in the west. But they are aware about the consequences and diseases that they might get from unprotected sex.\n\n2-Religion is not being forced on my child, on the contrary in fact she is a dedicated muslim. We are living in a country where islam is the main religion. \n\n3-I know a kid in school (I am a teacher, but not his) who is 18, he treats me like I am his big sister, I asked him what do kids his age do if they get out with a girl. He was reluctant to say at first but he hinted that they would do stuff that parents would not be happy about. He said that they\u2019re are apps now that they can just meet new people and hangout alone. Two people alone seems suspicious enough to me, I do not want my daughter to be in this situation.",

The interaction between kid and my son was odd to me so after we went on our way I asked my son about the boy. My son said that he got another friends older sister pregnant and put his hands on her so my son actually can\u2019t stand him anymore. \n\nWe talked about that situation a bit and I thought to verify that my own son knows how not to get a girl pregnant. We\u2019ve had our own conversations about it and he has taken a health class in school that per the agenda, covers the very topic of safe sex so that answer should be a very clear yes. My son says yeah mom, older friend told me & reminds me all the time. He even gave me some condoms just in case I need them.

She is absolutely going to look to you as a role model even if she says she doesn't.\n\nMy standards for men used to be pretty low and I'm pretty convinced some of that is due to my absentee father.\n\nImportant discussions:\n\n- Safe sex\n- Consent\n- Setting standards/boundaries\n- Music video/pornography standards vs real life\n\nSafe sex - condoms, birth control (and the side effects of those), risks of pregnancy, making sure both sides are comfortable and not pressured. Doesn't have to be painful either if they are considerate to each other.\n\nConsent - god, please include this. It is so damn important. There's a great video on consent involving a cup of tea analogy. It's great and on YouTube. She can say 'no' anytime.\n\nStandards/boundaries - ONLY when she's ready. She will know when that is. You get a funny feeling in your stomach when it's not right. Any doubts should be listened to. It should be with someone they trust and like. Should not be pressured under any circumstances. Should be in a bed, with candles and shit, treated with respect and kindness. She needs to think about all aspects of the person, not just if they're hot af.\n\nMusic video/porn - just because they act that way does not mean she should. The industry is notorious for objectifying women and sexualising them. It does NOT represent real life or real sex. All bodies are different. Vaginas are not all pink. They're not all the same shape and size. Same with penises and testicles.\n\nAbove all, be open to what she says and tell her you are always there for her, no matter how awkward it is or how embarrassed she is. ALWAYS be there for her. If she gets her heart broken, tell her you'll be there. If she's scared or anxious about taking the next step, be there.\n\nTell her you love her and trust her. Tell her you want her to be happy and explore this side of life safely and consensually. 12 IS early but not unheard of and I'd highly recommend suggesting she leave it for a few years. There's alot of growing up to be done between the ages of 12 and 18.\n\nSide note: I think it's lovely you've asked Reddit this. I wish I had a Dad who gave a fuck about stuff like this. By being open about this, you are not ruling her life (a common thing teenagers reject as part of becoming adults). You are treating her like an adult and showing you trust her. That will enrich your relationship more than you maybe realise right now, as scary as this subject and prospect is.\n\nSending you some parental solidarity. My time will come in about 7 years.",

N.O.V.A. is not all about substance abuse. They claim that their basic teaching platform is more about healthy decision-making behaviors and practices than anything.\n\nN.O.V.A. covers bullying, addiction & substance abuse, safe internet usage, risky behaviors, sex education, and other similar sorts of topics.\n\nAfter spending a couple of hours reading their materials and watching some of their YouTube videos, I've gotta say I'm pretty frustrated with what they're doing.\n\nAlmost everything they cover is spot-on. Their information on bullying is all correct (so far). Their information on decision making is generally correct. Their reporting for research on risky behaviors is mostly correct.\n\nBUT ...\n\nWhen they get to drugs, sex, and profanity - they're tossing around some rather unusual and flat-out false information; obviously adhering to the personal biases of the founders or the financial supporters and/or others involved with the foundation.\n\nThey're using the now defunct and invalidated \"research\" (if you can call it that) from the early-mid 1900's that misinformed generations of humans.\n\nThey're teaching the kids that vaping is just as dangerous as smoking ... which - wow!\n\nThey're re-vamping the whole \"marijuana is a neurotoxin\" thing (among other drugs).\n\nThey're telling kids that all drugs (all, as in ALL) permanently damage the brain, etc.\n\nWe know that the development of the adolescent brain can be permanently altered by medium to heavy drug use.

I didn't grow up with cousins of the same sex, but at this time my sister and I didn't bathe together and we're less than 2 years apart.  I didn't bathe with my friends at this age.

If they were smaller it wouldn't bother me because they would have more room and I know they'd be safe - also true.  I don't want to shame them and safety is an honest concern.  Saving  time or water is not a concern- if anything I think they take longer and play in there . \n\nI want my sd to feel comfortable in her body, and to not alienate or sexualize a child.

My nightmare is to be one of those awful parents who sends her alone into a pharmacy with $10, I've done my best to support her throughout her childhood and I want to continue to be someone she can lean on as she grows up. This is just the next challenge and I need to get out in front of it as best I can.\n\nThere aren't many other women in her life she could talk to besides my mother, and I don't know if that's a conversation they'd even be interested in trying. Either way it's not my mom's responsibility to talk to her granddaughter about these things. I know I'm working under a ticking clock and I want to be as supportive as I can. I want to see her pediatrician when it starts but I worry scheduling an appointment too soon would stress her out.

Those are hurdles we'll have to work on.\n\nI've begun my research and started making a shopping list, but still have a few questions. I'll try not to be too detailed. But I like making lists and plans. I keep an itinerary for vacations. Sorry in advance.\n\nOne book that's been highly recommended is \"The Care and Keeping of You 2: The Body Book for Older Girls,\" and I plan to order it, but I'd really appreciate any other reading materials to help both of us, but especially her considering it's her body going through these changes.\n\nI've read that calcium and iron supplements can help in the days leading up to her period, and that painkillers like ibuprofen, paracetamol, and Modil can help with cramps pain (as opposed to Tylenol), but we'll be careful not to overuse them. Are there other pharmaceuticals I should stock up on? Dark chocolate is supposedly good for easing the pain, she loves it anyway so that's good, but if anyone can confirm or suggest other helpful snacks I'm all ears. We have a heating pad she sleeps on sometimes for comfort so that should help. I've seen a lot of references to keeping a hot water bottle but it's unclear to me what that's used for. What's up with the hot water bottle?\n\nPadded period underwear is popular, with two brands mentioned a lot: Thinx and Bambody. But what are the pros/cons? Which would you recommend?\n\nKnixteen overnight shorts and Kotex U overnight pads are both popular. Would it be overkill to use them together or is this an either/or situation? I put a plastic liner on her mattress already and I know how to remove bloodstains with hydrogen peroxide. Are pantyliners an overnight thing, and what brands are best?\n\nI don't think she'll be ready for tampons but what do I know, I'm no expert. I have read that Platex Sport are best for kids her age but I'm open to suggestions. She goes swimming in our pool often during the summer, is that an issue? Can she swim with pads or do we need tampons?\n\nAdditionally, and this is more difficult: I know we'll have the safe sex and consent talk, but I don't know how to bring up that she is a product of two teenagers not practicing safe sex. I don't want her to think that she was an accident or unwanted. It feels like it will inevitably come up. It's something I plan to speak to a therapist about once I find one who accepts my insurance (among other personal issues) but in the meantime I have no idea how to discuss this. Any input would be appreciated.\n\nThank you for reading this far, that was a lot to spit out but I've been worrying about this lately and can't afford to procrastinate. I have to do right by my kid and I don't have enough answers right now to do that. Thank you for your help.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Not gonna lie, I kinda giggled my way through your post. Its sweet. My dad sucked generally but was always a trouper about periods (loved women he should know \ud83d\ude44). I still appreciate it at 40.\n\nAnyways. Remembering all girls are different....\n\n1. Get her a female dr. Drs are well placed to answer all and any questions and it will be good for her to have a touch point as she goes thru her teens\n\n2. Buy a supply of pads. Regular and super (overnight) ones, with wings. Take her with you (we dont know initially what suits us best, it takes time, just buy a reputable brand.). When its been happening for a while and she knows how it is for her, buy her different types of products to trial to find what suits her) but let her be in that process. I would hold off on tampons until she is used to it and panty liners are not for a regular period unless its a backup to a tampon.\n\n3. Look for a period pain specific med. Called naprogesic here but ask your pharmacist. Also ibuprofen based meds work well. She may be one of the lucky ones!\n\nEta. dont underestimate how painful or whack periods can be for some of us. Drs may recommend birth control to help pain and/or regulate if so. So dont panic if they ever suggest birth control. For your 12 year old lol\n\n4. Heat pillow or hot water bottle at hand is a must\n\n5. TMI. It can get messy as a teen just starting your period. Horrifyingly messy, scary clots, leaks, pain, blood on your pants, a lot of this happening while your at school. Be aware, be sensitive to her and its all normal. Let her off or be prepared to go get her if its too bad. \n\n6. Good call on the mattress protector and chocolate\n\n7. Tampons for swimming. Pads are very absorbent so you can imagine what happens if you jump in a pool wearing one... Hopefully this doesnt happen right on summer, I wouldnt reccomend a 12 yr old on her first or second period use a tampon. Depends on the girl but learning to even put them is.... a bit ugh. And messy.\n\nYou will be just fine dad, youve so got this.\n\nAs for the sex talk, good luck. I have a 7yo boy so im not much help there. Be honest is always good advice!",

        "content": "So with COVID, my SD9 was on remote learning all last year, and this year she\u2019s been on a hybrid model on and off (in school M-T-T-F and remote on W). So she\u2019s been using the computer a lot.\n\nLast year we had her doing her school work in our living room/dining room (we live in a small apartment, so it\u2019s pretty much the living room) unfortunately this was very distracting for her, and she almost failed last year (and the remote model they were using was AWFUL) \n\nSo this year, since the remote model now involves zoom classes we set up an area for her room to study in and we\u2019re able to close the door, so her 1yo brother isn\u2019t disturbing her like he did all last year.\n\nUnfortunately this has caused a new set of problems. For whatever reason, YouTube isn\u2019t blocked on their computers. And about 3 months back, I noticed it was quiet in her room when she was supposed to be in a class and I checked on her and caught her looking up stuff like \u201creal sex\u201d, \u201cnaked\u201d \u201cman put pepe in butthole\u201d \u201ckissing naked\u201d I stayed calm as possible and told her it\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of to be curious but the internet isn\u2019t a safe place for kids to learn about this stuff. Her dad joined in the conversation as well. We contacted BM and she apparently had already caught her looking stuff up on tv and had a talk with her? We were a little upset she didn\u2019t choose to talk to us about it but we brushed it off. \n\nWe had the normal sex talk with her a day later, and when we asked how she learned about this in the first place she wouldn\u2019t say or would just say \u201ci don\u2019t know\u201d she eventually broke down and said she had caught BM and her husband having sex and they didn\u2019t know she was there. We were obviously alarmed by this and asked her how she felt and she wouldn\u2019t elaborate and when we said she could tell her mom about this and talk with her, she begged us not to tell her. \n\nEven still this doesn\u2019t really explain how she learned the word sex? I assume she heard about it from a friend at school. \n\nBM is highly confrontational and we ended up not discussing it with her. I think we probably should of talked even though it would of been a shit show.\n\nWell we thought it was the end of it, but we\u2019ve caught her 5-6 times since then looking up this stuff in between classes. Once again we always emphasize there\u2019s nothing wrong with being curious and we\u2019ll always try to answer ANY questions she has, but the internet isn\u2019t a safe place to learn about this stuff and she\u2019s too young to be looking this stuff up. \n\nIt\u2019s resulted in us having to ground her for disobeying (grounding as in, no electronics/screens, no desserts, reading books and playing quietly in her room for a good part of the day) \n\nSince then we\u2019ve made sure to not allow her to have access to her laptop anytime she isn\u2019t working on class work, and have been checking her laptop at the end of the week, which she is well aware that we do. \n\n**Well she tried to work around this today and now we just got a call from the principal saying she\u2019s suspended from school because she was looking up \u201csex\u201d and \u201cfuck\u201d on google during a class break. \n\nIs this behavior concerning? Unfortunately she\u2019s always had issues with impulse control/lying (she once stole 100$ from her dad for snacks at lunch and bullied a girl in 1st grade) and I honestly think she may have ADHD. Her father had a bad experience with therapy at a young age and seems hesitant towards therapists because of it, but honestly I think she could use some help that we may not know how to give",

        "content": "Edit (2 days after original post):\n\nMore talking occurred over the course of a few days.  Kid cooled off and reflected.  She came back saying that the main thing that upset her so much so that my wife said something along the lines of \"you are oversexualizing yourself online for other's to do whatever they want with the image\"... kid believes that the power shouldn't be moved from her onto other people and my wife should have said, \"they will oversexualize you...\"  I agree.  I also think she was just mad because she had never crossed a line and felt put out by us calling her out a bit.  The kid is whip-smart though and really reflected and took the time to figure out what was making her so mad.  Thank you all for your commentary.  It gave my wife and me some good talking points amongst ourselves.\n\nOriginal post:\n\nContext: My daughter is 16 years old, good student, strong-minded, she's going to be just fine in the world.\n\nMy wife follows kid's Instagram and while occasionally, there are pictures that are borderline suggestive- nothing has ever crossed the line before now.... and by that I mean just barely crossed it.  This kid has huge breasts- there is no other way to say it.  If she is wearing anything lower collared than a t-shirt, there is going to be cleavage.  We are a pretty open family and try to talk about body positivity, consent, safe sex (including feelings), etc.\n\nSo, for the first time ever there was a pic that immediately my wife and myself thought needed to be taken down.  She was wearing a low cut shirt, lots of cleavage, jewelry falling into said cleavage, and her hands are on her chest (or hoover in place to show off gloves, in her opinion).  There were others in this series that I don't love, but this one in particular crossed a line into sexual.\n\nSo we make her take it down a couple days ago and she is still livid- goes as far as to say she is owed an apology for being made to feel bad about her body.  We try to communicate that despite privacy settings, anyone could screen shot it and it would be out there online forever and that is not the picture she would want coming up when she is applying for a job.  She insists we wouldn't mind this pic if she had a smaller chest (which isn't true at all- it would still be inappropriate- but there is not convincing her of this).\n\nI suspect she is just going to be mad and we are just going to have to hold our ground, but I would appreciate any advice or insight from other parents.  To be clear- it isn't pornographic- it is just too adult, too old, too suggestive.",

After consulting with the school (basically saying they didn't have the resources to keep her from skipping) we decided to move her to online schooling.  Grades suffered and we had no choice but to put her back in school.  Now we're here.  My wife and I have tried talking to her about her options and she is insisting on keeping the baby. She says she doesn't believe in abortion and isn't being receptive to adoption. I think she has this grandioso idea that her and her boyfriend are going to live happily ever after. A little context here. He is 18 and she just turned 16. She is still a sophomore and he is a senior graduating this year. Despite trying to explain to both of them the hardships that come with raising a child they are defiant on keeping the child. He is very immature (my daughter has even commented on it), but he does have a vehicle and a part-time job. We all know that isn't going to cut it. His plan is to get a full-time job and all will be fine. They both brushed off our questions about basic necessities like housing, food, baby formula, diapers, etc. He thinks getting a full-time job making minimum wage is going to cover everything.

If I could have I would have gotten pregnant again as soon as we got the green light to have sex again. My husband, however, was honestly pretty traumatized after the birth of our daughter. I was in labor for 40 hours, 2 failed epidurals, and an emergency c section that I had to go under for, which meant he wasn\u2019t even allowed in the room.

Based on the very limited information you were able to share, I wouldn\u2019t worry about this until she\u2019s older. Most people who are attracted to children have a specific age range for their preferences. Pedophilia is a very broad term. People who like older teenagers (over 14-ish) are called \u201cephebophiles.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, this is also been an age range where sexualization of female children has been normalized. Lolita, for example. For this reason, most \u201cstatutory rapes\u201d are not prosecuted. \n\nAgain, based on the information you shared, there doesn\u2019t appear to be adequate reason to withhold your daughter from visitation, although your concern is completely valid. . \n\nI do wonder if there\u2019s more about him that you don\u2019t know and if so, how distressing that information might be. \n\nIf I were in your position, I would consult with a therapist (MFC/SW type) and potentially an attorney. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you have to deal with this.

I was really young at the time and wasn't ready to settle down the way that my daughters mother would have liked and she took her from me. Got a protection order and pretty much dipped. I had supervised visits with my daughters grandparents for 6 months. The last time I saw her was Easter when she was 2 and a half. \n\nNow fast forward 14 years. \n\nSo last week I get a frantic facebook message  from my daughters aunt saying that she ranaway from home with her 19 year old boyfriend and no one can find her. She doesn't have a phone and she won't talk to anyone. I can't look at any social media posts from her mom as she has me blocked on all social media. Even though it's been 14 years I love my daughter and so now I'm kinda freaking out. I wait a few days to see if they find until I get a message from her aunt again saying that she is being sex trafficked. At that point I track down her boyfriend on Facebook and message him, asking him to have my daughter call me. My daughter calls me right back screaming and crying cussing me out saying that her mom said that I didn't want anything to do with her and a whole bunch of other lies. Luckily I am able to talk to her and calm her down a bit reassuring her that none of that was true. I tell her that if she needs me to go get her I will. She lives about 100 miles from where I live. Well she wasn't in the city she lives in, she made it about 150 miles away, about 150 miles for me. I told her I have an extra bedroom and she can come stay with me but boyfriend can't. I go get her and bring her home safe. She was never being sex trafficked her maternal family was just spreading lies to try and make people feel bad and try and get a reaction out of our daughter. \n\nNow a week later I have learned a little about what went in at her moms house. No school or doctor since age 8. She has 7 brothers and sisters. She sees her stepdad beat her younger brother up almost daily. Her parents are never around and her being the eldest is forced to be mom for her siblings while mom is out at the bar or whatever she is doing. \n\nI guess I really just need advice on what I should do next. I went to courthouse to try and file something to get emergency immediate custody but the everything was closed. I called a lawyer and he told me not to do anything until mom tries to get her back. I want to make sure all my i's are dotted and t's crossed. I want a court to give me some sort of custody. I never want her to be back in that toxic situation again. I want to get her in school but where do I start when she hasn't been in school since 4th grade? Getting any of her documents is a nightmare rn. Its taken almost the whole week just to get her birth certificate. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.",

        "content": "This could be a little controversial when it comes to parenting advice but I think it\u2019s good. \n\nAnytime a movie or tv show is implying sex by a character pulling out a condom and then cutting to a new scene I take that as my dad cue to shout in an emotionalless voice. \u201cHey look they are going to have sex and have decided to make better decisions together by using a condom!\u201d \n\nSo today my daughter was asking me about our female and male dogs and wondered why we don\u2019t just give them condoms? \n\nYay, an association has been made and I think my chances of being a young grandpa is going down!\n\nEdit For context. Our female is in heat for the first time and both dogs are whining to be with each other. My daughter is old enough to know condoms are useful if used correctly. Having a dog in heat is new for all of us and has been a pain in the ass. She half wondered if they had sex once if she wouldn\u2019t chill out afterward and that could be the end of it. Just questions about biology, kids think weird things if you keep everything in shadows. I\u2019m glad she felt comfortable enough with her dad to share this potential fix she came up with even if there\u2019s no chance of it working. \n\nEdit Yes because this is about sex and dogs that\u2019s weird but I\u2019m happy she made the connection. Not a connection I was looking for her to make but she was trying to solve a real life problem with something grownups had mentioned before.\n\nEdit Maybe this post was too adult for this place?\n\nEdit Our dog isn\u2019t spayed because of covid we had an appointment about a month ago and it was cancelled. This is a parent post it\u2019s not about the dog.",

        "title": "My family shits all over my parenting style behind my back..",
        "content": "They say that I\u2019m spoiling my three year old because I don\u2019t spank her when she has tantrums. \n\nI grew up in a toxic household where we would get a belt whooping over everything. My cousins were in the same boat. All of us grew up to be really fucked up. My cousins have severe identity issues. My siblings and I have difficulty expressing emotion. We also struggle with self worth, trust, and just overall have no idea what direction to take in life. The more I learn about the effects of toxic parenting, the more I connect back to my own childhood. And it wasn\u2019t just ruthless physical punishment. All types of fucked up mental torment and manipulation. My alcoholic mother is especially gifted at this. We\u2019ve all suffered as young adults in various ways, but we are healing together. \n\nWhen I got pregnant I began a frantic search for advice and research about parenting. I want to break the cycle of abuse and provide my little ones with a safe and nurturing environment to grow into. My toddler is three. She is a hellion. I\u2019ve decided I don\u2019t want to spank her. Not trying to judge other parents but i just believe that I can teach her to manage her emotions without physically causing her pain. I use the naughty seat when I can obviously tell she is doing something malicious but that\u2019s very rare because she\u2019s a sweet kid. Most tantrums are over chocolate and screen time. She asks for those two things ALL DAY. She gets sweets and screen time, but I have to set those healthy limits. And when I do she looses her shit.  Do I punish her for getting upset? No! Do I give in and give her what she wants? Hell no. I hug her, acknowledge that she is mad because I won\u2019t give her what she wants. I ask her to breathe deeply with me (which she actually does now!! Took a whole year of effort and now she does it), and I literally tell her \u201cI love you, I know you\u2019re upset, and it\u2019s okay to be angry.\u201d Then guess what happens?! She hugs me back, cries a bit in my arms, then she just gets over it and scampers off to go wreck some shit in the house. \n\nIt feels good. It feels so good to approach her wild crazy fits with so much inner calm. I love seeing her start to develop coping mechanisms like deep breaths. When she gets mad I try to teach her the words that match her emotion and she\u2019s starting to get it! She\u2019ll say \u201cI\u2019m crying. I\u2019m frustrated.\u201d I feel pretty damn proud of myself. I think when she\u2019s older, she is going to have an easier time juggling her own emotions. I also think that when she\u2019s a teenager and going through teenage hell, she will have so much trust in me that she will come to me for comfort. Instead of what I did; which was self harming in a closet and having sex with any boy who would look at me. \n\nWe do have dicsipline in our home. We have limits. We have structure. But I\u2019m not going to beat my child over an emotion. I see her tantrums like they\u2019re panic attacks. Her little brain can not cope with her disappointment so she flips her lid. She\u2019s not trying to disrespect me. She\u2019s crying for help. Taking away the tablet might not seem like a big deal to me. But to her, her whole damn world just collapsed on itself and the little dude can handle it. BECAUSE SHE IS THREE. She can\u2019t even wipe her ass without my help. What should I expect her to do when she\u2019s upset? Politely say \u201cMother, I am disappointed that you won\u2019t give me endless amounts of sugar. I guess I\u2019ll go sit quietly and think this through.\u201d \n\nSo let them talk mad shit about me. Let them call my daughter a brat. Let them say I\u2019m a weak mother. If anything it fuels my strength. \n\nMy three year old came up to me, put my face in her tiny chubby hands, looked me dead in the eye and said \u201cI love you with all my heart.\u201d VERBATIM. \n\nI have no memory of ever receiving or showing affection to my mother. All I remember was fear and pain. The pure love I get from my little girl every day just floors me every time because I never had that shit. \n\nI know I\u2019ll fuck my kids up in some way. It\u2019s impossible not to. However, they\u2019ll never question my love for them and I will never leave them with  regret for sharing their emotions with me. Mark my words, I will be deserving of their trust. \n\nThank you for coming to my TEDtalk. I\u2019m sorry, I just needed to dump this out. I know it\u2019s a chaotic plunder of nonsense. I hope it kinda makes sense.\n\n\nUPDATE ::\n\nUpdate :: \n\nI am absolutely floored by all of the support this has brought. I didn\u2019t not expect this at all. \n\nThis sub is incredible. You all are my village. Thank you to everyone who read my post and took the time to share, encourage, and spread some love. I don\u2019t really get this kind of reassurance. (My husband is amazing but he is in the same boat. We encourage each other but it\u2019s like grasping for a hand in the dark sometimes) I\u2019m always second guessing my decisions and praying for a nudge in the right direction. You guys just came together and welded some serious armour around my soul. From the bottom of my heart thank you. And thank you to the people who gave me gold. I\u2019m just floored right now. \n\nI have an infant so unfortunately can not reply to everyone, even though I really want to. So here is a mass reply I hoped you can see it. I have read every post. \n\nTo everyone who is asking for resources, I can\u2019t provide links because I really don\u2019t have the time but what I have found most helpful is; this sub! YouTube channels: The School of Life, The Parenting Junkie, The Hapa Family, Super Nanny videos. I have books that I want to get on audio book and several are mentioned in this sub!! Janet Lansbury is my queen. \n\nWhen i was pregnant I literally googled \u201cHow to not screw up my kid\u201d and I actually found good stuff!!! \n\nTo everyone who talked about how they parented in the same style, or where parented in the same style: THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. You are the fuel to my fire. \n\nTo everyone who mentioned they were also abused and have awoken from the same nightmare to see how they can change and break the cycle. My eyes well up with tears for you. My heart is pouring out. I. Fucking. Know. Bro. I know how hard it is to have to reprogram your whole psyche for the sake of your children. It\u2019s like these little monsters came to help us heal. Stay strong. And have grace for yourself. I have made countless mistakes, but when I see that I REACTED instead of RESPONDED, I scoop her up and apologize. There is no situation that you can not come back from. \n\nTo everyone suggesting that I dump my family. Try to understand that they are all victims of abuse themselves. Victims of racism. Victims of poverty. And they do have wisdom that I have learned from. I love them, despite how they can really be toxic. But when they are toxic I just distance myself. And I also stand up for myself. And my kids will see that, I\u2019m hoping it will model for them how to stand up for yourself with respect and poise. \n\nTo the people who expressed that they struggle with coping with their toddlers chaos. Don\u2019t feel alone. I am constantly suppressing an urge to act out reactions that my parents exposed me to. With time, patience, and knowledge you will overcome that struggle!! Finally now, my body isn\u2019t getting triggered by her like it used to. At first I was constantly on the edge of loosing my own mind. (A few times I did and literally locked myself in the bathroom crying because I almost hit her). But today, her tantrums don\u2019t even get my heart rate up. It gets better, but you have to put in the time. Don\u2019t expect everything to line up right away. If you want to make that change, you can!! \n\nThis is my opinion. And I have only been parenting for three years now, so this is a very raw and unseasoned perspective. But a good parent, is a parent that actively seeks information to make themselves more capable. Advice that was given to me was always have a beginners heart. Always learn and seek knowledge. Be the parent that you needed when you were little. \n\nWhen I start to break down, I lie in my bed under my comforter, hug myself, let out a good healthy cry, and reassure myself. \u201cI\u2019m not a bad mom, I\u2019m not a bad wife, I\u2019m not a bad person. It\u2019s okay to be overwhelmed. No one was meant to do this without a village. It\u2019s okay to get upset. This will pass.\u201d And I breathe deeply. Then I\u2019m fine! That was what I needed as a scared little girl. It\u2019s what I need today as a young mom in an ocean of confusion. And it\u2019s what our children need as they learn to cope with this overwhelming world. \n\nI wish I could reply to everyone, I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t. I\u2019m so grateful for this village and everyone in it. Thank you for empowering me. Stay safe out there. And let\u2019s keep being strong for each other. Seeing everyone chime in about how they are taking similar approaches to raising empathetic and kind children means that their generation will be filled with balanced and stable people to build a better world together. \n\nMy prayer that I say everyday, I will share with you. \n\nYah, protect my children from my imperfections and empower me with the tools to mother them in the way that they need me to be. Give me the patience of a thousand mothers, and give me the discernment to guide them through the chaos. \n\nLet my ceiling, be their floor.",

        "content": "Struggling With my relationship/partnership with my common law spouse.  We have a 2.5 Yo and a 2 month old.  There\u2019s a lot of resentment towards him right now and I find myself saying \u2018I hate you\u2019 under my breath all the time. \nI\u2019m frustrated because I literally have zero time to myself to do anything I want to do.  Of course baby needs me, but my son comes to me for things every time before he goes to his dad. So I\u2019m constantly being asked for something.  I do all the cleaning, cooking, planning on meals, ensuring we have stock of all essentials (diapers, formula etc.), wash every bottle, boil all the water for said formula, handle all finances. I literally do everything.  It drives me crazy that he can\u2019t just pick up things and put them away. If I left something out on that counter who knows how long it would take for him to put it away. It just drives me insane.  He just doesn\u2019t take the initiate for things and I\u2019m always making decisions because if I didn\u2019t do it nothing would get done.  \n\nThe resentment is because my husband has an obsession with some video game and claims he needs this time to play his game in order to not go crazy. Well, what about me? I have nothing.  I know part of this isn\u2019t his fault .. if we weren\u2019t in isolation I\u2019d be seeing friends and family, going out and about and being able do some things for me. I get it, it\u2019s not his fault. But not once has he put baby to bed or gotten up with her in the night. So, when I get up at 10:30,1:30 he\u2019s still playing his fucking game and I hate him for it.  I should maybe, just maybe be allowed to sleep during one of these feeds and he deals with it, but no. His precious fucking \u2018alone time\u2019 is so important.  For the first month we had babe sleeping in her swing until she started stirring and then he\u2019d bring me to her, but that doesn\u2019t create good sleeping habits, nor is it safe so I put that to a stop. Now, I spend sometimes almost 2\nHours to get her to finally settle for the night, maybe spend 30 min watching a show and then I NEED TO go to bed just to make sure I can get some sleep in before she wakes up.  What pisses me off is when he says \u2018she\u2019s asleep, enjoy your alone time.\u2019  Ya dude, my maybe 30 min while you stay up and play for stupid game.  I have to go to bed because unlike you, I have to prepare for a potentially brutal night.  And then, he has the audacity to complain that HES TIRED .. com\u2019on. Don\u2019t complain to me when you make that choice to stay up instead of having the luxury of actually being able to get a decent night sleep. \nOn top of all of this, we have basically a loveless relationship. No sex, no time spent together. We literally just live in a house together But spend no time as a couple.  Last night he said \u2018 we should really start thinking about what it looks like to parent separately\u2019 for the first time I said \u2018fine.\u2019  he\u2019s said this to Me countless times before but this was the first time I actually agreed with him, instead of trying to \u2018fix our problems\u2019 which I always do. I\u2019m always the one to say sorry and try to mend whatever fight we just had.  \n\nI\u2019m just so fed up with him.  He has this desire to be ensure that he feels like we are equals when it comes to what we do for the household or our family, and it\u2019s just not accurate.  I know he had a fucked up childhood and I sympathize with that,  but I don\u2019t understand why he needs to prove that he just does so much for this family, or needs to ensure that I appreciate every little thing he does. It\u2019s like every time he does one thing he needs a pat on the back.  Imagine I needed that shit every time i did something? It would be non stop.  \n\nNot sure what I need here but I needed to get this off my chest. I\u2019m so fed up with this competition between us as parents, on top of everything else I\u2019ve mentioned.\n\nEdit to say; thanks for the support and suggestions.  He\u2019ll do things like bath our son and put him to bed, when I\u2019m tied up with our daughter and he has to go to bed. Or, he\u2019ll do some tasks / chores around the house that I\u2019m just physically not able to do. \nHe does some things but definitely on his terms when it\u2019s convenient for him, and he\u2019s definitely spending way more time gaming than helping me with things.  \nYesterday he called me miserable.  I am. But it could be changed with just a bit more support.  It doesn\u2019t take much to make me happy and supported and he\u2019s just lacking so bad right now. \nAs I type this he\u2019s actually trying to get our daughter to nap. ... I\u2019m shocked he took the initiative and is doing it. Maybe what I said yesterday to him has made him think about things a bit. ... who knows",

It's fine if he wants to play games. It isn't fine that he neglects parenting to do that. If he wants to stay up until stupid thirty playing his game, that's his call--but he's waking up and doing breakfast/morning care a few days a week, so he needs to learn to manage it.  \n\n\nMy husband would do that thing with the games. You know, staying up until Silly O Clock and then wenching that he was tired. I told him I didn't want to hear it. If he wanted to prioritize his games over sleep, that's fine. He's a grown up. But he doesn't get to be grumpy at me or not do what he needs to do. Me being blunt got the point across.",

My wife had started taking her PPD medication, and my parents offered their help to get our family back on the right track. I last posted an update in October. \n\nIn February, my wife found a man online and moved into his apartment. There was no warning. When I was at work, she moved all of her things out. She brought the kids back over in his car after I got home from work. \n\nShe couldn\u2019t even look me in the eye. She explained that she wasn\u2019t happy. She said that she has never been happy with me or the kids. She told me that I could have full custody, but she would send us some money once she gets a job. She also begged me to not take her to court. \n\nLuckily, my work was forgiving enough to give me a week off to figure everything out. My mother ended up moving in with us to help me avoid child care costs. My father visits on weekends or whenever he can. \n\nMeanwhile, my soon-to-be-ex wife is having the time of her life with her new \u201cboyfriend\u201d. Before the Coronavirus, they were going on vacations and bar hopping. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re having wild sex that we haven\u2019t had in years. They\u2019ve been posting pictures online about how happy they are together. I\u2019ve never seen her smile so much. He funds her kid-free lifestyle, so no wonder she\u2019s so thrilled. He has a child that he doesn\u2019t have custody of either. What a classy guy!\n\nIt hurts so badly that I\u2019m numb. I don\u2019t feel anything anymore. I have cried every single day. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m depressed, but I\u2019m keeping it together for the kids. My parents have been my rock, but I feel terrible asking them for so much help in raising my children as a 34 year old man. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do at this point. I\u2019m an essential worker, so I thankfully still have employment. That\u2019s the only blessing in my life aside from my kids. I never imagined my life would be THIS fucked up. It got so fucked up in a matter of months. I never saw it coming.  \n\nThanks to everyone that gave me advice previously.

        "most_upvoted_comment": "Oh my goodness. That is terrible. You need to get an attorney ASAP for two reasons. 1. You need to file for full custody before the guilt sets in and she wants to see her kids more. You would not believe how these situations can 180 and all the sudden you are losing primary custody and you are paying child support. In most states the family law courts strongly favor women, almost blindly. 2. You should go head and file for child support even if she cannot pay. That way she can start racking up the back child support for when she gets the job. She is garbage. You deserve so much better.",

I would like to hear from people that have actually gone through this already.  I don\u2019t have to actually worry about this subject for quite some time (~4yoDD, ~1yoDD) but I actually never had this talk with my mother so it\u2019s going to be interesting.  It\u2019s probably a reason why I\u2019m already thinking about it, amongst other \u201canother story for another time\u201d moments.  I\u2019ve gone through sex-ed in school and was a huge prude until basically right out of high school but then found out what life was outside of my cocoon and let\u2019s just say I didn\u2019t hold back. I have no regrets.  \n\nMy approach to the actual sex part with my girls will be more of a conversation saying that it isn\u2019t necessarily when one loves each other because let\u2019s be real, that\u2019s not really true.  I want to explain the actual reality of sex in and of itself so they don\u2019t go into meeting someone looking for love in all the wrong places.   I\u2019ve been there done that and I also don\u2019t plan to control every single aspect of their lives so to me, having them be safe aware and protected with a certain mindset, is better than expecting people to be in love with them just because of sex.  Of course I\u2019ll explain the significance in the repercussions of that action, so I don\u2019t want to come across as if I\u2019m pushing them toward exploring anything before they\u2019re actually ready to.  \n\nIs this a way that anyone here has done?  I am a very straight forward parent and enjoy explaining situations as they come, right then and there, so I just hope that by doing this it more so sets them up for success rather than searching around figuring it all on their own.

The fact it was in my house I should at least be afforded the respect to know who it was. And even though he feels he knows her if there had been an emergency where an ambulance or cops would have had to be called would have been really difficult with not even knowing her last name. He agreed, understood my point, and said he would be more up front with us. Still don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to find out her last name or not lol. At this point that\u2019s his decision until he decides to have her spend the night again!",

If he was safe, used protection and they both soberly consented that\u2019s more important. \n\nIn a few months he can do whatever he wants with whoever he wants.",

She knows she can ask questions. \n\nI try to teach her the scientific terminology of her body parts such as vagina and butt etc. her dad and his family disagree and use \u201cpet\u201d names. \n\nShe knows I get my period every month because she never gives me privacy in the bathroom and when she\u2019s asked I just told her that it\u2019s something that happens to adult women\u2019s bodies and it\u2019s natural. She asks me questions about boobs and when she\u2019ll have them, why she can\u2019t have a bra etc. \n\nShe decided to google about pregnancy again at school and her teacher text both me and her father. When I told them I would talk to her about it and possibly get some age appropriate books and allow her to ask questions, her dad flipped. Now we have two different ideologies\u2014 he is conservative, pro life and does NOT want her to google/ask/read about her body, whereas I am more of the whole it\u2019s her body/her choice/ she is allowed to know about herself and want her to come to me with questions instead of feeling ashamed of her body/curiosity and I want her to come to me in a couple of years when puberty hits. \n\nHow the hell do I handle this when he is adamant that I\u2019m not allowed to teach her this stuff because he feels it\u2019s inappropriate? It\u2019s not like I\u2019m gonna explain sex to her.\n\n**edit** **y\u2019all...this child. All she wanted to know is why another teacher is having a baby and what is she naming it.

        "content": "My son is 11 years old (6th grade in middle school), and generally an optimistic, intelligent, creative kid. He does not have many friends, and I don't think he is particularly close to the one friend that I know about. He is very, very closed off emotionally. He loves hugs and cuddles (in fact he craves them to the point that it's probably excessive for a kid his age), but won't ever talk about what is happening in his life or how he feels about things. He does not answer direct questions about anything. He has always been like this.\n\nHe sees a therapist to help him with his anxious behaviors. Yesterday after his session, I asked him what he did or talked about, and he just clammed up and refused to tell me. After a lot of prodding, and visible annoyance/borderline anger on my part, I finally got him to say that they played Jenga. (This is pretty normal, they spend most sessions playing games. The therapist has tried to explain his reasoning behind how playing games is good for helping his anxiety, but whatever).\n\nThis type of exchange is not unusual for my son. I wasn't asking to give an opinion or discuss his feelings (I know better than that by now). I was asking him to give a straightforward account of what happened during a safe time, when he was doing something he enjoyed. And he refused to tell me, until I had to get angry at him.  When we got home, I tried talking to him, and kind of apologized, saying I wasn't really mad at him, I just want him to share things about his life with me, because he's growing up. He started crying and said he \"Didn't want to grow up.\" I didn't know what to say to this, so we just went inside and watched cartoons for a few minutes before bed.\n\nI can't discuss anything with him that's not about movies/books that he likes, or \"look at that cute baby animal! AWWW!!!\" I told him that we got the the letter from school about \"your child will be getting sex education within the next few weeks\", and he started crying. He knows what sex is, and he's surprisingly astute about issues around choice and consent, just from our discussions about current events. But if I ever tried to talk about it in a personal way, he would get upset and start crying. I tried to joke with my husband about the inevitable day that he'll have to start shaving his teenage mustache, and he freaked out. God help us when he hits puberty.\n\nHe doesn't seem to be insecure in school. He gets good grades, and is interested in his classes. He has an IEP because he had some attention/focus issues, and also gets some speech/language therapy for something called \"Social Pragmatic Communication Disorder\". He has only the one friend (who he won't let me talk about), but I know that he's well liked because I'll see other kids say hi to him (while he tries to hide). I doubt that he's being bullied, but even if he was, how would I know?\n\nI'm not sure what my question is here, I guess I'm just venting because I don't know what to do about how he communicates (or doesn't communicate).",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Well, I know you are feeling shut out, but I think getting angry with him over not sharing the contents of his therapy session was out of line--that's the nature of a safe and private space, which is what therapy should be. That aside...\n\nIt sounds like he has a hard time expressing himself verbally and communicating in and of itself is a source of anxiety for him. Can you try communicating with him through a different medium? I used to write my parents letters to talk about difficult things because face-to-face was too stressful. When I'm writing, I have time to pause, think and consider. I am also an anxious person, and someone DEMANDING that I share my inner world with them would honestly make me clam up and not want to share ANYTHING. \n\nMy interpretation of the whole exchange? He has anxiety over getting older, growing up, maybe death. And that's what was the topic of discussion during therapy, but he is embarrassed about that, hence his refusal to tell you. But when you showed him anger and annoyance, he caved and shared it--and collapsed into tears because the whole conversation left him emotionally exhausted, or possibly having an anxiety attack (uncontrollable crying is what anxiety attacks look like for me). You've got to find a better way to connect, and putting more pressure on him will make it worse. You also should evaluate how much you really have a right to know--if he's being a good kid, doing well in school, working on issues in therapy.\n\nIt sounds to me like you have a very intelligent, very private child... and if he hasn't given you a reason not to trust his judgement, you should respect his privacy within reason.",

        "title": "[Update pt 2] My kid's father watched porn next to them in bed.",
        "content": "[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/aaaysy/my_sons_5_father_watched_porn_next_to_him_in_bed/)\n\n[First Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/aclxzg/update_my_sons_5_father_watched_porn_next_to_him/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo a year ago I posted in here that my son told me that his dad was watching porn next to him in bed. At the time, I told who I thought I should tell, my lawyer and my councilor. I was told there was nothing anyone could do. I was distraught but I had hoped that maybe being caught would make him smarten up and get his shit together.\n\nAlmost one year later here I am again. I was notified that cps had been called on my ex because my daughter had reportedly told someone that when her dad is putting her to sleep at night, he sometimes looks at pictures with private parts. It is exactly the same story my son told a year before hand, but now it is happening to my daughter. My son never told his sister what he had witnessed, he was afraid of her seeing it... and here she is a year later saying exactly the same thing. The twist is, she said that her dad told her not to tell anyone, specifically not the babysitter because, \"She doesnt want to hear about private parts.\"   She said that when she sees him looking at these things she gets \"jealous\" because he is looking at their \"private parts\". She was asked how often this happens, and she said, \"Sometimes.\"   when was the last time it happened, \"Last week.\"\n\nShe at the time was also scratching a lot at her vagina and I asked her what was wrong. She said that she had been really itchy lately and that her dad had put some creme on her. He had not mentioned this at all to me so I had no idea.  I straight away took myself to counselling and arranged a doctors appointment for my daughter. My councilor told me that showing children pornography is abuse. She said that if it wasn't already reported, she would have had to. I discussed going to the doctor with my daughter and asked if she would be okay if the doctor looked at her to see why she was so itchy. I made sure she felt as safe as possible and we talked about safe people and not safe people etc. The doctor got her to relax and he looked at her. He said the she didn't have visible signs of damage on her vagina (which is good), but that she had a yeast infection. Her dad had not taken her to the dr. and I dont know what he was putting on her prior to this visit.\n\nThe following day I was told I had to take the kids in to do an interview with CPS. They wanted to interview them both separately. I was so anxious because in my mind I didn't know what  was worse... that my kids wouldn't say anything and he would get away with it... or if they would say something and it was worse than I had expected. I was so nervous I was sick with worrying. The interviews took over two hours. When they were done, the CPS worker and a police officer took me in to another room to talk. They said that both kids refused to talk about it. They said that when secrets were brought up, they both \"clammed up\" and wouldn't say anything about either event. I was so angry... I said, of course not. She said that he said not to tell anyone... They aren't dumb they don't want to get their dad in trouble. They said that because she wouldnt repeat the story to them, there was nothing they could do. They said \"Just keep an ear out and the next time it happens let us know.\"\n\nSo they acknowledge it will probably happen again.  And instead of stopping it, they just shrug their shoulders and say \"There's nothing we can do.\"     \"Next time it happens...\"     \"We'll talk to him...\"   Because he already told them not to tell anyone and they listened. All this did was alert him that he needs to be sneakier and lie harder.  I tried to talk to my lawyer but she says, \"There is nothing I can do. Im sorry.\"\n\nEveryone says trust the system. Let the professionals handle it they know what they are doing. Well no body is doing shit. Nobody will help me. My kids have the EXACT same story a year apart. They are obviously bothered enough about it to mention it to people. It is damaging them. And nobody will do anything.\n\nThis man is disgusting. When we were together I caught him sending videos of him jerking off to people while the kids were in the next room while he was supposed to be watching them. He would talk about sexting people and sex stuff in front of our kids when they were two and three years old. He would brag about how he would, \"recruit\" women for these sex chat rooms he was obsessed with, and that he would send videos multiple times a day. EVERY DAY. I saw him talking to a just legal teenager over text, trying to solicit nudes from her. And when she was not responding how he wanted, sending her naked photos of himself.  This is just the little bit of stuff that I KNEW was happening.  No mention of all the stuff that I didn't know about (secret accounts, emails, etc).  He is a predator. He would never think this about himself, but he is. A sexual predator.\n\nAnd I have to keep sending my kids there every week.  And he knows. He thinks that I am fighting him because of all the shit he did in our relationship. He tells people lies about me and makes up bullshit about how I didn't work and I was holding him back. These things are not true. He makes it out that I am all about trying to take money from him. I would gladly give him all his child support back if It meant I never had to send the kids over there again. I don't care about him or his money or anything.  I am worried about him hurting my kids, directly and indirectly. My five year old daughter is worried about getting fat because of him and will refuse to eat. My son never feels good enough. I am trying so hard to do right by them but I am fighting against an upward current and all anyone can say is, \"I'm so sorry this is happening to you.\"   \"Im sorry you are going through this.\"\n\nIt is happening to MY KIDS.  THEY are the ones that are going through this.\n\nI have nothing else I can do. I feel like I have failed as a parent because I can't protect them. I feel like I have failed as a mother because when I am dealing with all of this, in addition to the other tons of stresses that come with trying to navigate life during divorce and after separation, I am exhausted and angry all the time. I try to keep my mood up as best as I can but I feel like I am at the lowest point I have been in years. There is a large part of me that just wants to die because I feel like I can't do anything to help. I am so worried that years from now they will be asking me, \"Why didn't you help us? Why didn't stop this?\" And they will hate me. I have never spoken ill about their father in front of them, I havent even told them why I kicked him out (lying, cheating etc). I am trying so hard and he just gets to walk away with everything. Ive never felt so helpless and alone and I feel like no body is getting angry enough.\n\nTo everyone telling me, \"You are doing the best you can\"... I am. And it isn't enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit\\*\\* I have tried more than once to get my kids in to therapy this past year but was told they are too young. I did finally get a suggestion for a child - play therapist so I will seek that out. But in the mean time my kids are on high alert and won't talk to anyone about this. When we got home from the interview I was upset. I asked my daughter, \"how come you didn't tell them what happened? How come you said before that you saw these things, and now you wont talk about it? \"  She said, \"I don't remember that I said that.\"   I said, \"Well you did... no one would have made that up.\"    She got upset and said, \"If I did see those pictures would I be in trouble?\"  She was almost crying... I reassured her and told her that of course she wouldnt be in trouble. She just kept saying she didnt want to be in trouble. She wouldn't talk about it after that. She would just say, \"I dont remember\". She put herself on lock down.",

It's what used to be classic home economics in older populations. A lot of schools don't have this program anymore . I think it's great. I we t to the sane school and we had it then as did my 4 siblings. \n\nHe is on the child development unit and they are given sacks of flour they have to treat like a baby for a week. Flour babies! They do have the electronic dolls in the highschool but middle school is too early for that expense.\n\n\nHe has a log to fill out for 24 hrs a day. Making them think about what a baby would logically need doing for those 24 hrs such as feeding, changing, sleeping, playing, burping. All those things.  And then she gives them 3 questions to answer everyday in 100 words or more. Things like discribeing your day with the baby and what needed done. Then some questions like what did you find challenging for the day with a baby.  \n  \n\nIt's a week long exercise to help them realize how much work children are even if they are fake. And just imagine if it was real. I do love this exercise. And yes they have to carry them at school with them all day. He has a weights class for his last hour so he can't watch the baby so they have to ask their teacher to \"babysit\" (hold the flour in a designated safe area and sign a sheet of paper. So no leaving your baby in a locker all day!  \n\n\nHe isn't liking the exercise so much and he's an only child. He has never been raised with babies or helped with them so he is pretty clueless about all the work. So I helped him with his first log for the evening at home.  I \"watched\" the baby so he could do his chores. So about an HR on the log. Then made him think about how long it's been since the last feeding, diaper change, how long she has slept and when is bathtime, bedtime, feeding routine.  What is the next time you think a baby would need changed. Would she need to eat again, how long it would take to put her back to sleep after that diaper change and feeding. \n\n\nHe's not really waking up at 2am to do all this, but he does need to think about it and plan accordingly . It may seem silly but hopefully he will get the point by the end. And yes the flour baby is a girl. They had to draw it out of a hat. The teacher tries to keep the sex accurate to what currant statistics say the boy:girl ratio is at the time.  They do need to come up with their own names and some other details.  \n\n\nHis cat was pissed that his boy didn't get to pay attention to him because he was busy doing homework a lot longer then normal and did try pawing at it so I said think about what your cat would be doing if that was a real baby. And you do get points off of that bag is damaged. So maybe stop your cat because he will try to throw it off the table. \n\n\nThey are encouraged to actually wrap up the baby in a \"blanket\". And the teacher encourages the parents to actively make the make the kids care for the well being of the baby. So now throwing it on the bed and forgetting about it all evening.   \n\n\n\n\nEdit: I can't possibly reply to all the comments but I am loving them!

        "content": "Winter is coming, and I\u2019m nervous, S.A.D (Seasonal Affective Disorder) is real, and to top it off I have been slowly succumbing to the very real invisible load of motherhood. I have effectively been battling this giant for almost twelve years and it has finally caught up with me, now I feel like it\u2019s killing me.\n\nIf you are a mom and don\u2019t immediately recognize the expression \u201cinvisible load,\u201d I can guarantee you are more familiar with it than you believe. You know all those things that you do, the things that go unnoticed \u2013 but if you stopped doing them would immediately be felt by the entire household? All those intricacies that keep everyone comfortable, aligned, balanced and organized. The things that everyone thinks happen magically and are necessary but after you put that last kid in bed (for the third time) leaves you screaming in a pillow or sobbing uncontrollably in the closet because you are exhausted and overwhelmed.\n\nFor example\u2026\n\nMaking sure your family is social, planning and attending get-togethers, knowing your kids\u2019 friend\u2019s names along with the names of their parents, remembering to send thank you cards, managing the family calendar while avoiding conflicts. Changing out the seasonal clothing and knowing when and where to donate or pass on to a friend. doling out punishments and restrictions. Changing rules as they age out, figuring out what is appropriate for them to watch or listen to, what apps they can or can not have. If you have children with any special needs like myself, prepping the kiddos for the blood draws and extra doctor appointments. Explaining why and how every step of the way. Keeping up with vaccines, Lysoling all the doorknobs and light switch cover during flu season. Planning dinner, snacks, and lunches making sure the kids aren\u2019t overindulging in trash food. Fostering healthy habits. Knowing who is going to fight you at dinner because they hate carrots. When was the last time their nails were clipped, hair cut? Coordinating with teachers, making sure no one is falling behind, staying up to date on class goings-on, pick up and drop off logistics, encouraging practices for music, sports, and other extracurriculars. Overseeing the homework they gave you but not forgetting that there is likely [all] the things they \u201cforgot\u201d about in their backpacks or posted in a Google classroom. Assisting with projects, all those last-minute pickups of supplies for class parties. Taking a mental note of who the \u201ccool kid\u201d and the bully at each of your kid\u2019s schools. Who are the positive influences and who you kid avoided at the last birthday party? Managing social media activity and balancing screen time, navigating trends (good, bad and ugly), worrying about and then explaining the latest and ongoing tragedies of the world.\n\nThis ladies and gentlemen is the invisible load of motherhood. Most people would be tired just reading this list very abridged list. If you are a mom, this is just a day in the life, nothing surprising here. You (mama) also understand this doesn\u2019t even scratch the surface of what you think about daily. Every mom carries it. Its weight can vary day to day but it never lets up. I didn\u2019t even delve into the psychological and emotional needs of a family. Am I disciplining enough? Am I disciplining too little? How much time have I spent with each of my children individually? How do I help my babies cope with anxieties and anger individually? Which of the kids needs extra support right now, who is thriving, who needs an extra push?!\n\nThis invisible load that moms carry is not just physical, it is mental and emotional and always exhausting. Attempting to constantly control, define and interpret all the facets of your family life can affect everything from your friendships, your marriage, your sex life, and ultimately your overall mental well-being. These things happen in the background, like a rouge phone app, on top of the typical household duties and I\u2019ll tell you \u2013 I\u2019m an equal opportunist when it comes to housework, I don\u2019t believe in gender roles so I do laundry and I fix the leaky toilet, I scrub the toilets and I take the car in for a service. These are some of the more visible things moms do to keep their households are running smoothly and keep their families safe and healthy.\n\nBURNOUT IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. This stuff is never-ending, some days feel like 15 years and some days I am overjoyed with the thought that I have 4 amazing human beings who never cease to amaze me. I am a freelance designer and photographer who works from home. I have a wonderful and supportive husband who works extra hard to provide for the family and so I do a lot at home on my own. We have four children, daughters 3, 8, 10 and a son who is almost 12. This is our first year with a child in middle school \u2013 a big transition for him but I never expected the transition to hit me as hard as it has. On any given day I am a glorified Uber, short-order cook, referee, maid service, a teacher and psychologist. I\u2019m called to drop off instruments at school when they are left behind and also instill in them a sense of responsibility for their actions. Not to mention tending to your friendships and your family relationships, and your marriage. By the time you get to thinking about yourself \u2013 it\u2019s hard to imagine even attempting to do anything for yourself outside of just catching your breath. The juggle is real!\n\nThese feelings have left my friends and even family wondering where I\u2019ve been, my husband scared; watching me laugh-cry myself into a frenzy, and my closest family checking in to make sure I haven\u2019t run away from home. I\u2019m hiding out because I\u2019m feeling empty; Literally hanging on by a thread but still pour from what feels like an empty pitcher into every member of your beautiful family\u2026 even the dog and the cat need individual love and attention. Drained but pushing on I am working on finding ways to combat these feelings and thrive in my day-to-day rather than barely survive.\n\nI\u2019m not writing this with the end-all solution, I\u2019m simply sharing because I know I am not alone. It is reassuring just to know that you are not the only one that isn\u2019t in love with being mommy 24/7, who is struggling to make it through her day-to-day or that the people who look like they have everything together fall apart more often than we realize. Again I\u2019ll say, some days are better than others; some days I put a good face feeling like I\u2019ve got it, other days I am one book bag on the floor from losing my shit. I am doing my best to improve my feeling overwhelmed by sharing more with my husband about things he can help me with as well as trying to make time alone more of a priority. Time to myself isn\u2019t always possible but when I do have a few minutes, I use them to meditate, read or do yoga. I specifically choose these activities because I know even in short doses they have the biggest mental pay off for me.\n\nThe trenches of motherhood are real and I imagine the struggle doesn\u2019t get easier but just changes as your children get older, so for me, it\u2019s all about staying vulnerable, introspective, and adjusting my approach to keep the load from crushing me.\n\n[Original Post](https://eatplayluv.co/the-invisible-load-of-motherhood-is-killing-me-slowly/)",

I felt slightly judged recently for allowing my daughter's boyfriend to lay beside her in bed with the door open. That's what brought this up.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "I had girlfriends over at 16, we were given privacy to be alone in bedroom. By the time sex was on the agenda it was legal, consensual, and safe. Having sneaky quiet shags while parents were downstairs was something of a rite of passage I think. Perhaps it was different being a bloke - I suspect the fear of being led astray or pressured into sex didn't cross my parents minds. \n\nYour house your rules, you know your kids. If they can't have safe sex at home they'll find somewhere else to do it, probably less comfortable, intimate and private. Trying to stop horny teenagers shagging is like trying to hold back the tide. Best it be allowed somewhere safe.",

I recognized the address as the guy who lives nextdoor to this family with 3 kids (one being an 8 to 9ish girl). This is a brand new neighborhood everyone has been here for about a year or less.

Like she should warn her daughter to never interact with their neighbor, at all. Ever. I'll definitely be teaching my kids to avoid that house and it's occupants while he still lives there. Idk and then part if me feels like a nosy neighbor spreading gossip around. Maybe this Mom has already looked at the registry and knows that her neighbor is on it. Then there is another part of me that thinks that I should warn *all* the mom's in the neighborhood.\n\nI'm really conflicted, should I keep this information to myself? Or tell the one nextdoor mom?

He is a drug addict and dealer and after I left him 2 years ago, he went to prison for a year. When he got out, I decided to let him see the kids here and there.

        "content": "We live in a really nice, safe neighborhood. Double townhouses throughout. Our direct neighbor who we share a wall with has a young son. He\u2019s 12 years old and a really polite, sweet kid- I\u2019ll call him C. I have 4 kids. My oldest is a girl who\u2019s 11 and then a 9 year old son who attend the same school as our neighbor and ride the same bus.  C lives with his single Dad. C comes home to an empty house after school every day- which is ok, he\u2019s old enough and mature enough. But the problem is the way him and his father go about this. His Dad will leave their garage door open for C to get inside. But the Dad is constantly forgetting to leave the garage door open. C knocks on my door to use the phone to call his dad regularly. Then his Dad will open the garage door from wherever he\u2019s at. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s an app or something linked to their door. Well I\u2019ll invite him in every time and make him a snack and ask about his day. Real sweet boy. Then he\u2019ll play with my kids until he gets ahold of his Dad and gets let inside his house. Yesterday I had picked the kids up from school and we went out to run errands and eat out for supper. We got home around 7pm, pull into our driveway and I see C on his front porch. It\u2019s dark out and his sitting on the porch step, leaning over and resting on his book bag. My heart sank and I was furious. I hugged him and brought him inside, made him something to eat and he called his Dad. I was expecting to hear his Dad apologizing profusely and saying he\u2019s rushing home. Nope. C was on the phone for 2 minutes and hung up, then we heard their garage door opening. I asked him when his Dad was getting home and he shrugged his shoulders. The thought of this poor kid sitting on his front porch from 3-7 and then going to an empty house and putting himself to sleep- not happening. I told him to call his Dad back and tell him that he\u2019s staying the night at my house. I gave him some pjs and washed his school uniform so it would be clean for tomorrow. My kids had a sleepover on a school night and were thrilled. They all are off to school the next morning - and it gets worse. I hear from my two oldest kids that C told them that he\u2019s had sex before! He\u2019s 12. I thought he was just telling stories, tryna be cool. Well, it didn\u2019t set well with me. None of this sits well with me. The very next time I see C, I straight up tell him what my kids said and ask if it\u2019s true.  He tells me yes. I ask a hundred questions. It was with a 14 year old girl. We have a super long talk. I tell him everything that I would be telling my kids in this situation. He begs me not to tell his Dad, pleads for me not too. I\u2019m completely divided about how to handle this. Part of me wants to go off on his Dad and tell him what a shitty job he\u2019s doing in all aspects of parenting. And part of me wants to just continue taking care of C whenever he needs it and be that adult he can go too. My husband doesn\u2019t care how I handle this, C just isn\u2019t allowed to hang out alone with our oldest daughter anymore. What would y\u2019all do?",

Try to nicely address this with him so they can work out a more reasonable and consistent solution to that, like the good old days, perhaps a key?\n\nThat 12 shared this very personal bit of his life with you about sex is something that should remain with you.  He obviously likes and appreciates your care taking (even in the minor ways you do it), and trusts you, he sees you as safe and as a resource.  Do not destroy this very precious component to his life by violating his confidence in you by telling dad.",

        "content": "We\u2019ve run into a touchy issue and are trying to form a plan on how to approach things. Our son (12m) has a girlfriend (12f) at school and has exchanged a couple risqu\u00e9 photos with her. \n\nWe\u2019ve had discussions on a few occasions about the severity of underage kids sharing inappropriate pics and he seemed to understand. We let him know it has the potential to get him labeled as a sex offender as well as the possibility of getting us in trouble with the law as well. \n\nA bit of back story to paint the picture. Our kiddo is generally a great kid. He\u2019s funny, polite, and generally a normal kid. He has had trouble in school with turning in assignments which we\u2019ve been working with the school to try different tactics to steer him in the right direction. Alas, it\u2019s a tough age and socializing is more important to him and he continues to have low grades because he won\u2019t hand things in. \n\nOne of the primary tactics is loss of privileges, specifically his cell phone. We don\u2019t use the word punishment as that is reserved for explicitly \u201cbad\u201d behavior but the deal is that if he has any assignments not handed in, he loses the phone. \n\nWe\u2019re into the last marking period of the year and he\u2019s already behind on some assignments and thus has lost his phone until everything is turned in. One of the deals with him having the phone is that since he\u2019s only 12, we as parents have the right to look at his usage to be sure he\u2019s being safe and acting appropriately. We do not regularly snoop as we would love to give him benefit of the doubt but occasionally we do take a look. He\u2019s in the habit (as is his gf) of deleting texts daily, they (as smart as they are ,lol) admitted this to my wife when she drove them to the movies one day. \n\nSince he\u2019s off to a rough start to the quarter already my wife took a peek today to see if any clues would hint at any issues hat may be going on. After digging around she was able to access some \u201chidden\u201d photo albums in which she found a photo of a young girls butt. It\u2019s not some high quality poem image from the net and it\u2019s pretty obviously a young girl. Along with that he had photos of himself fresh out of the shower (just chest up). \n\nWe plan on confronting him obviously and also feel her parents should know what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re not 100% sure it\u2019s his gf but everything points in that direction. I haven\u2019t looked myself and am adamantly not going to look, I fully trust my wife on this. We will give him the opportunity to tell us the truth and if he denies it\u2019s her we will let him know that we are going to speak with her parents. \n\nThe photo wasn\u2019t extremely graphic but I\u2019ll be damned if my kid gets labeled as a sex offender over this. We plan on speaking to her parents face to face when it comes to that but how to approach the conversation we want to tread very lightly. With both kids deleting their texts, all we have is the pic. We don\u2019t want to come off as accusatory nor do I want my son  to take all the blame. \n\nAn intermediary might be something to consider but who? Involving the school may cause more issues if they have an obligation to call the police. \n\nHas anyone dealt with this? Are there any angles we\u2019re not seeing due to the initial shock? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Try to go into the conversation with him calm and not accusatory. Kids this age are having a lot of developing feelings, and although most of them recognize that they are not ready for sex yet, they do want an outlet for these feelings which is where sexting comes into play. Try to let him know that you see his point of view, you get why he and his girlfriend are doing this, but that exchanging pictures like this with each other is extremely dangerous. Maybe if you go in with that mindset, he will be more open about it and less likely to react negatively. Of course, he\u2019s probably going to feel totally humiliated by the whole thing, so some level of negative reaction is to be expected.",

The pressure from it is destroying me.\n\nI told my husband months ago my coworker pointed out our kids cross eyed, all of a sudden he wants to argue about it. He belittles my coworker and I and after showing him pictures of our kid he asks why I made such a big deal out of it. Seriously?!?! He brought it up, he was a jerk about it even picking on the kids that he googled to \"prove\" our kid wasn't, though our child's eyes look just like those other babies!\n\nTells me I'm not allowed to take the baby out of the car seat because I always hit his head. It happened once. While at the store later he pushed the baby in the cart, the cart had a broken buckle so he had to hold the baby and the baby fell over smacking his neck into the cart leaving a huge mark. But yes, I'm the dangerous one.\n\nThe baby was diagnosed with a yeast infection because he refuses to bathe him more than once a week (its supposed to be their thing and he's gotten pissed because I've done it multiple times). Accuses me of never reminding him, though I do DAILY and he's too busy on Netflix. Plus I shouldn't have to remind him, he doesn't remind me to feed and change the baby! I of course feel super guilty I waited 4 or 5 days to bathe him. If I did it every other like I try too it probably wouldn't have happened but I was do busy trying to get a second part time job I let my responsibilities and his fall to the wayside.\n\nThrows a fit because I ask him to buy groceries after he hasn't in 3 or 4 weeks. Tells me it's not even his week though it clearly is his turn, this was Thursday and I don't get paid until today, Friday. Therefore it now  (friday) my pay week, but I'm sure next week he won't have any money either, even though he makes more than me and I buy the baby EVERYTHING.\n\n\nAsked if I wanted sex and I said why would I with someone so mean, and he said because his dick is hard and I replied the only way I would is if he was nice, then he called me manipulate and compared me to a hooker asking for $20\n\nBlames me for not telling him I was going to bed when the baby did even though he saw me bring the sleeping baby in. I'm exhausted dealing with him, what's he expect?\n\nAngry he stayed up until 3am and an hour later I called him (he wanted separate rooms as soon as we moved back in while I was pregnant)(I moved out for 2 years) to change the baby while I made the bottle, got the medicine (teething) and went to the bathroom. I'm hot and sweaty and go to change because I have work in the am and dont have time for a shower. Another fit, I say set the baby in the stroller and he cussed me out and implies I dont care about the baby, which is something he does daily. He proceeded to call me a little bitch because I didnt give a full dose of tylenol all in one go and divided (pushed the plunger in spurts) the dose up so the baby wouldn't push it out or choke on it. I then stayed up with the baby for like 2 hours. \n\nI'm getting major depression, I feel like I can't breathe. It started after he hit me in face while I was holding the baby. We've been together 7 years with a break in there, it was only once, but paired with his behavior and refusal to admit he has issues is just crushing me. I think about killing myself, but wouldn't because I don't want him raising our kid, I don't want our baby to turn out vile like him. \n\nHe pays the rent, we have no where to go, my family is dead and my friends all live across the country. I cant be in a shelter with the baby, while the baby could live at home. I can't leave the baby here either though. I guess I have to apply for housing because I currently live with a monster. My kid doesn't need to see me belittled and told I dont love or care about him.  I'm doing the best I can while fighting tears because I don't want my kid to see me cry. His dad calls me libral (not btw, just sick of his bad attitude) and ask if I need a safe space.\n\n\nPs. I think my husbands gay. He's had gay best friends who he no longer talks too, like they were an affair and hes hung out with drag queens (at their houses alone). Swears he isn't but hes accused me of it multiple times before (stopped going to the mall or lunch when we moved back in together) with my married with kids gal pals and there was clearly nothing going on and I've never given him a reason to think that. I dont hang out with lesbians or openly \"gay\" drag kings (?). No offense to anyone, it's just not for me. But it would explain why my husband HATES touching me and REFUSES to unless it's sex. Maybe it's why hes so angry all time.\n\n\nAny advice on leaving? Am I being dramatic? Not sure what I except, I guess I just want to know I'm not crazy and leaving is best for our child.",

There was a few months of turbulence as he tried to carry on controlling my life through contact with my son. The police have been called on numerous occasions. The last time my son seen his dad he grabbed my son while ignoring him and repeatedly said to me he wouldn't leave until I spoke to him as I looked like I had been having rough sex (I hadnt). I ended up grabbing my son back and trying to close the door while he pushed it open. I quickly sent my son upstairs while his dad was banging and kicking on the doors and windows trying to get in. I asked him to leave or I would call the police. He didn't so I rung the police. As he was trying to smash my Windows and door to get in he started shouting through the letterbox to my son that he needs to let him in or he'll be in trouble, I held onto my son and cried while singing a song to calm him down while on the phone to the police.\n\nSince then my son has been traumatised.

How can I help and support him? \n\nIt was the police and social services who told me to stop contact with his dad for his son's safety.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Get the child into therapy asap. \n\nI've been down this road. \n\nThose are some good ideas about how Daddy might be feeling, but sometimes even though we understand the reasons for people's choices, our first job is to stay safe. Daddy's behavior right now is not safe for you or me or even himself, and its very scary to the people around him. Daddy is going to get some help learning about his feelings and choices, and we will too. For right now, we need to stay away so we are safe and he knows we are safe. We will call Daddy on the phone one day when he is better and has been better for a long time. We will never ever answer phone calls from him or from strange numbers, and we will never open the door unless I say it's ok... even if daddy tells you to through the door. Let's make up a secret code word to let each other know when it's safe to do something and when it's not safe, so we know if anyone is trying trick us, just like when a stranger says they have sweets or puppies. How about bananas-for-breakfast when its ok, since bananas are sweet, just like how much (list trusted loved ones) love you? We can use lemons-at-lunch if we need help. Lemons are sour but still sometimes taste ok, kind of like how daddy said (insert awful confusing thing the child probably needs to talk about). \n\nGive the actions to the father. Give power to the child without making him feel like he has to choose. Reassure often. Be extra sweet. Talk about it often. Take this opportunity to teach self power and self love; explain abuse and reactions to it like you're talking to an adult. Teach positive coping mechanisms. Teach more options. Give a huge amount of structure in his life. Be honest. \n\nPotentially controversial personal anecdote and suggestion:\nAfter I addressed some awful stuff initially after they occured, I stopped giving the abuser a name and focused only on the events, the actions, and gradually and intentionally replaced the bad with good examples, with excess explanation about *why* they are good examples, never mentioning the wolf in sheep's clothing outside howling. I let my child forget this person while helping him grow up healthy, empathetic, attentive, compassionate, self reflective, and making actively positive and considerate choices. I told him when he turned 12. Maybe 13 or 14 is a better age. I don't know. I do know that my child trusts me to tell him the truth, always, when the time is appropriate. I know he empathizes with others but still makes his own safe choices. I know that right now I'm going through a breakup from an emotionally abusive relationship that thankfully mostly isolated himself from my son as part of his control-isolate-compartmentalize agenda, and my son readily accepted the bald facts i gave and even told me he knew I'd talk to him about it when the time was right. He's amazing.\n\nI'm sorry this is happening. Remember to take care of yourself too. Now is a great time to practice positive coping mechanisms just like those you're trying to teach your child; model the actions, say what you're doing and why. Give yourself structure and routine. Get yourself a support group or forum or counselor or anything. Read, stay informed. Don't be alone in this. Write down or take a video of yourself listing the abuses over the years. Remind yourself of the dealbreaker. Recognize when you second guess yourself or start to fall for the \"I've changed think of our son\" routine. Prove to yourself and your child that this can and *will* be done. Because that is the truth. \n\nAn afterthought: just like everyone is going to be sure to reassure young one that its not his fault, that there was nothing he could have done differently, this also applies to you. This is the snake head biting after it's been chopped off. It is not your fault. Not your fault for choosing him. Not your fault for not listening to yourself. Not your fault for not noticing a sign. Not your fault for letting it get this far. Not your fault for letting your kid get hurt. Not your fault for not leaving sooner, fighting back, knowing better, not setting a better example, not getting help... that's the abuser speaking in your ear like a poltergeist wreaking havoc inside you. Itll happen with young one too. He might blame you too. Its important to share these feelings with young one too, if only for modeling how to move with them and past them.  Your ex's actions and damage are his, his own, and will stay with him until he lets it go. Give it a lot of time. If you think you're ready to forgive, reapproach, to try again: you're not. When he's been in therapy for a decade and displays consistent health in his normal life, then maybe friendship and camaraderie can come back up between you and you can begin healing your son's relationship with him, thus helping heal your son of the rift he's carrying inside. This is world changing for him. Literally life and death. Go snuggle.",

        "content": "I posted a question two weeks ago about a proposed plan to host my son and his friends for an after prom sleepover. They intended to go camping but because they have graduation rehearsal the morning after, one girl hates camping, and one boy was unable to convince his mom to let him go due to his medical issues, I offered our house as a safe alternative. \n\nIt's 7 kids total including my son and there are 4 boys and 3 girls. One boy and one girl are in a relationship. The kids have been friends since elementary school, with the exception of one of the boys who joined their group in middle school. Sleepovers are common with the boys. None of the girls have ever stayed the night but they normally leave around 3 or 4 in the morning on weekends. The craziest thing that happens when they all hang out together is games of Twister going too long, drinking too much soda, and using the pool as a punishment for losing in poker or monopoly. My son plays soccer with 2 of the boys and runs cross country with 5 of them. Most have gotten into their top choice colleges. It's a very wholesome group and the parents are on board with the sleepover. \n\nMy question is if we need any more rules than what we normally have? We don't allow drugs or alcohol and won't for the sleepover. We tell them to make sure they put out the bonfire. Do we need to explicitly say \"No sex\"? While I don't care what these kids do in their free time, I don't want any trouble with parents. Is there anything else I am forgetting that separates this from a normal sleepover?",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "This seems to be about the parents - so this is the perfect time to fire up a group text and say something to the effect of, \"We know these are good kids. Are there any specific rules you would like to see so that this sleepover is a (wholesome) success?\" Since your primary concern is getting along with the other parents, I'd definitely include them in the process.",

        "content": "Watched Young Sheldon with my 9 yo son this morning before school. He usually jumps in bed with me after his dad wakes him up in the morning- husband goes to work before 6. The plot line involves the mom having a miscarriage. She never says that. She tells her husband she \u201clost the baby.\u201d  My son asks me what happened and I tell him she had a miscarriage. He gives me the look - Mom you\u2019re just talking and not telling me anything. And down the rabbit hole we went. \n \nSo there were technical terms and sex ( got a laugh there) but I had to explain the function of a uterus and with no coffee or preparation I told him it was like a baby purse, designed specifically to keep and grow babies safely inside a woman\u2019s body. I don\u2019t carry a purse except for special occasions so it seemed an adequate explanation at the time.   \n \nAnd then there were more questions and explanations of the uterine lining (like the lining of a purse!) and then we had to talk about periods and Oh my God this kid was loaded for bear with his curiosity.  \n \n \nLast time we went thru his search history we found a couple of pregnant belly time lapses. Pretty good ones, nothing trashy or explicit. And we were struggling with how to talk to him about his curiosity. He took care of that.   \n  \n  \nI wrapped things up - because he still has to get ready for school and I still have to pack him a lunch- with a dick joke. Not intentionally.  Just anytime you say penis it is a dick joke apparently. So then I told him the classic Elmo joke to round things out and move on to other things our morning would have involved. You know? Two test tickles. He giggled and I told him, there we talked about a lot of info you probably still have some questions about but we\u2019ll have to wait until after school to discuss it. But at least you got to hear your first dirty joke. \n \n \nHis eyes snapped up at me and he straight up belly laughed- real throw your head back laughing- at me and said Mom, Oompah already told me my first dirty joke. I was so proud and disappointed at the same time.  \n  \nSo thoughts for the day \n1. I hope he knows I will tell him the truth and an that will make it easier to ask me anything \n2. I want him to know and not think he knows because there\u2019s nothing more dangerous than people that grow up thinking they know something \n3. My husband\u2019s perspective on this is priceless: we watch 80 science shows on tv and the boy was probably thinking Where\u2019s my panel of experts on this shit? Nobody says anything. \n4. Parts is parts. No mystery should linger there. \n5. My dad (Oompah) is way more amused than he should be about this whole thing.",

        "title": "A boy exposed his \"private\" part to my daughter at school!",
        "content": "Today, immediately after school my 9 year old daughter told me she had to talk to me about something that happened at school. What she told me put me in shock for a moment. Her and her bff at school had just got outside their class into the hallway for dismissal line-up. They are both into collecting Littlest Pet Shop toys and had a few out while waiting talking and trading their toys. A boy from a different class came up to her and said (specifically, and I know this she told me) \"I wanna have sex with you.\u201d and pulled the front of his pants down and pulled his \" Part \" out exposing himself. My daughter and BFF ran in their class and told a teacher. I honestly couldn't even believe what I was hearing coming from her mouth! She also told me this isn't the first time he's said to her and other girls that he \"wants to have sex with them\". The counselor briefly asked them what happened and he did contact me after school. He told me they will be investigating the incident and he is talking more with my daughter tomorrow. I told him I appreciated him talking to me and to please keep me informed of what happens. My daughter is mortified and my husband was beyond LIVID and wanted to storm down to the school! I was upset as well. I want my daughter to feel safe at school!  I feel like he should have consequences, I mean even the context of what he did and says disturbs me. This wasn't a kindergartner being bored or something. At this age they know better. I don't want this to get swept under the rug. Am I overreacting? Should I voice that consequences are absolutely essential? Is this not a form of sexual misconduct? My daughter still plays with dolls and make believe. I don't want her exposed to things too early.I am overwhelmed by this whole situation.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "It is totally understandable that you are feeling overwhelmed. I can also understand why your husband is so upset. However, what does he think storming down to the school will accomplish at this point? Right now, they have told you they will investigate and talk more with your daughter. If they don't follow up with your daughter, then please follow up with them! However, right now you have to actually let them do their thing. (If you want to take it outside of school to the legal world, you are certainly within your rights to do that too.) You also need to brace yourself to not be totally satisfied - due to legal privacy reasons, you won't be able to be told what exactly the boy's consequences are. That can feel very rough, so I wanted to forewarn you. I'm so terribly sorry this happened to your daughter and the other girl. It is absolutely not okay! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can think of one follow-up that could happen with the school going forward. I would just make sure they know in writing that you don't want your daughter in any classes with that boy during the rest of elementary school. If they end up at the same middle school, then you can bring forth that same concern. That is absolutely a reason for them to never share classes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish you all the best!",

        "content": "Hi, I\u2019m new to Reddit! I\u2019m a 32F mom that has two identical twin boys (who\u2019s ages are 14) My husband and I got divorced when they where only 4. So he\u2019s out of the picture and they have no father to look up to. I don\u2019t know if this is what this is about but it\u2019s out of control. \n\nBasically ever since my two twin boys have entered their teenage years, they won\u2019t carry on conversations with me, they yell at me constantly, and they never come home on time. (They have a curfew). \n\nOne of them has a girlfriend the other twin does not and the one that has a girlfriend has supposedly started being sexual with her. Yesterday I got a call from his girlfriends parents and they said they caught my son supposedly \u201cfingering\u201d his girlfriend in her bedroom. They told me that they leave the door open so that they can keep an eye on them but oh my gosh who at 14 does this? And who does it with the door open?? I immediately apologized to her parents and made my son as well and he\u2019s no longer allowed over at her house anymore. Her parents won\u2019t let her come over here either. \n\nSo that happened...\nI really don\u2019t know how to deal with that one because he doesn\u2019t have a dad in the picture to talk to about this kind of stuff. He knows about sex, masturbation, and safe sex. He knows everything, so does my other son. But I honestly don\u2019t know why he thought it was a good idea to do in the first place (especially with the door open) \ud83d\ude33 I tried to talk to him about it but he acts like it\u2019s nothing and pushed me away. He\u2019s mad he can\u2019t come over to her house anymore he cried. \n\nAnyways, I need to figure out how to deal with that on top of my other son who won\u2019t get off the PlayStation. He literally sits there from the time he gets home from school to the time it\u2019s time to go to bed. I now give him 1hour to play after school (has to do homework first) but unfortunately that doesn\u2019t work. He\u2019ll stretch it out as far as he can so that he can play longer. I told him many times that if you keep going past your time that I gave you, you won\u2019t get to play it. He said \u201cthat\u2019s not enough time to even do games mom\u201d I said I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re just going to have to play what you can within the time limit and if you go over it I\u2019m taking it away. On the weekends he also sits in his room and plays from 9PM to 3AM in the morning and when he gets up in the morning at 8AM he\u2019ll get on it and won\u2019t get back off. I try to make him get out of the house and I\u2019ve also tried to force him to get out the house and he always turns around and yells at me and says \u201cyou\u2019re the worst mom ever\u201d. \n\n\nSo I don\u2019t know what to do these days. I\u2019m going to have to deal with the fingering problem in the video game problem at the same time, any advice?",
        "most_upvoted_comment": ">oh my gosh who at 14 does this? \n\nUh... really? The answer there would be \"most of my high school friends, except for the one who actually started having sex at that age.\" And I'm female, I'm not talking about high school boys making up stories to brag -- I'm talking about the relationships my female friends were in at that age, with fellow high school boys their own age or barely older.\n\n>who does it with the door open??\n\nReally horny people who don't think the others in the house are paying attention.\n\n>I\u2019m going to have to deal with the fingering problem in the video game problem at the same time, any advice?\n\nFocus on the video game problem. There's nothing abnormal or bad about discovering foreplay at 14. He's already suffered the consequences in that he can't go over to her house anymore. And of course he pushed you away -- what 14yo wants to talk to their mom about their sex lives?? The \"fingering problem\" isn't a problem. It's just a normal developmental stage that he handled a little awkwardly (also normal -- who isn't awkward at 14) and suffered some appropriate consequences from.\n\nThat much video gaming, on the other hand, can actually be bad for you. It messes with his sleep cycles, which messes with his mood. It takes time away from worthwhile things like school, a social life, and physical exercise. And it's just a bad habit that won't serve him well in life. So see if you can figure out what he's getting from that and what reasonable, consistent, absolute rules you can make and enforce.",

        "title": "Incident between 11 yo son and girl in his class, looking for advice",
        "content": "(warning for possible csa mention)\n\nI'm a single mum of an 11 yo boy, looking for some advice on something that was brought to my attention today by the school, as I'm not sure who to talk to IRL about this. \n\nI was called in today to talk to the teacher and vice principal. They informed me that it was brought to their attention earlier this week that something happened between my son and a girl in his class a couple of months ago. I'll call them John and Jane to keep things anonymous. I'm trying to keep things as objective and level headed as possible but obviously emotions and stress are fairly high right now.\n\nThe story I was told is as follows:\n\nThe two kids are friends, and were playing a game together in class. John said that the loser of the next game would have to complete a dare, and Jane agreed. Jane lost the game, and John said that the dare was that the two of them would touch each other's private parts. John supposedly set a time and date that they would do it, in the sports shed after the two of them packed away equipment at the end of the day. I'm not sure how much time passed between the day of the dare and the day they followed through. John apparently pressured Jane to follow through with it. He also told her that she had to keep it a secret from everybody. They touched each other, and then went home.\n\nAs far as I know that's all that happened. The teacher told me that last term the girl went through a time when she was uncharacteristically reserved and quiet, and she suspects that it may have been caused by what happened, but she can't know for sure as they're unsure of the date that this happened. The girl has only just told her family about it all, and the mother informed the school who informed me. Jane and John are still friendly towards each other and play together happily, according to the teacher. They're quite drawn to each other as friends (in part of a larger group) and she never picked up on anything strange going on between them. John has never talked to me about this girl. We have a pretty open relationship, and he often talks to me about his crushes. I've answered his questions about sex, bodies, puberty, etc, including consent. He is also close to my father, his grandfather, who he sometimes talks to about things that he doesn't want to talk to me about. \n\nI haven't yet talked to John about this. Partly because I'm unsure on how to approach the subject, and partly because I think it's best to wait until the school term finishes next week. I would normally talk to my dad for advice and support but I think I want some input from others first. The vice principal told me that in her experience, when these things happen, especially with John telling Jane she needs to keep it a secret and being quite pushy, it can be a sign that he might be a victim of somebody else, or at least heard or seen things. Nothing comes to mind for me in regards to this - there's nobody that John is in contact with that I've had bad feelings about, no signs that he's being harmed by anybody, etc. Of course I wouldn't want to rule it out as a possibility just in case something is going on, but my gut says that this isn't the case. We do live with other adults, but they are friends I have known for years, who John also likes very much, and he's barely at home alone with them anyway (5 mins while I run to the store sort of thing). He spends a lot of time with his granddad, but I feel fairly safe in ruling that possibility out. They have always been close and John loves spending time with him. The only real time I can't account for is when he's at school. He doesn't like school and often doesn't want to go, but as far as I know (and what he tells me) it's because he feels picked on by his teacher and excluded or bullied by other kids (he can be very frustratingly hyperactive and annoying sometimes, possible ADHD). So overall I feel like my gut says he's not being abused by anyone, but it's hard to know if I'm underestimating this possibility.\n\nThere have been a couple of other incidents that came to mind when this was brought up with me. When John was at a different school, around 5 years old, he got in trouble for doing a \"I'll show you mine if you show me yours\" type thing with a girl his age. As far as I know, no touching was involved. He was of course told that he's not allowed to do things like that again, but the teacher didn't seem concerned as she said that kind of curiosity is pretty normal with young kids. The other thing that comes to mind is when he was probably around 8 I found porn on the computer he had been using. He said he was shown it by other kids when he was playing minecraft or something, I don't really remember the details now, and got curious and ended up looking at a lot of it. I told him that while his curiosity is normal, he's not allowed to look at porn until he's much older. I gently explained to him that it's not a real depiction of healthy sex, it's often violent and degrading, and just not appropriate at all for a kid of his age, and if he has questions about sex he can ask me or his granddad about it. He seemed to understand that and agree to it. Since then, he has gotten his own laptop (they need it for school) and I have no idea what sorts of things he's been looking at on there. It's a concern that's crossed my mind before, but I don't have access to his accounts (he's made at least 3 of them, all password locked), and even if I did I never wanted to invade his privacy by snooping (he's tech savvy enough to be able to delete his history now anyway, probably). Now I'm not sure if that was the right decision, maybe I should have kept a closer eye on him. I really don't know.\n\nOf course I feel awful that this girl has been harmed because of something my son has done. It's a horrible feeling. But I'm kind of at a loss with what to do now, how to bring it up with him and what to say, if there should be some sort of punishment and if so, what. I don't even have his side of the story yet, although it's hard to imagine an 11 year old girl making these kinds of details up, so I'm inclined to believe the story. I'm aware that the story has gone from Jane->Jane's mother->school->me so who knows what kinds of details have been misconstrued or misunderstood, but if John gives me a totally different version of what happened I'm not sure how I would know whether to believe him.\n\nHave any other parents experienced anything similar? Anybody with an outsiders perspective got any insightful thoughts on the situation? Especially anyone who was an 11 year old boy once, maybe you can tell me how normal this kind of stuff is so I can get an idea if I should be worried or not. The school suggested going as far as getting John counselling. I know that at the very least I need to have a good conversation with him again about appropriate touching, boundaries and consent, but it's hard to know if I should be worried about this pattern of behavior (if it's even a pattern at all and I'm not just overthinking things), especially as he gets older, or if it's just fairly normal stuff and he needs a good talking to. It's hard to imagine him doing this as he really is a sweet kid, a bit of a mamma's boy really. As you can imagine I'm pretty stressed right now.\n\nAny thoughts or advice are appreciated. Thanks in advance.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "First have the conversation with him about what happened and if you feel like it\u2019s something more than what he\u2019s telling you yes get counseling.

        "content": "First time mother here, and very concerned.\nSo I had my baby in June and she is my only daughter.\nThe Father (my boyfriend) has refused to work (even the entire pregnancy) because he is \u201ctrying to make it big on YouTube\u201d although I\u2019ve yet to see it happen. I was sick and hospitalized my entire pregnancy with extreme nausea and wasn\u2019t gaining weight or able to eat. When I had the baby my boyfriend and I decided to stay at his moms because where we live (taking care of his sick Dad) has out of control dogs. MY Mom was staying there too (she lives out of town) and eventually left because she was sick and my boyfriends family was bullying her the entire time. After she left they tried to convince me to never speak to her again. After I found out everything they told me was a lie we\u2019ve fixed our relationship and she visits every couple months.\nAnyways since then things with my boyfriends family have gotten out of hand. A little back story on them: mother and stepfather are both racist homophonic rich white privileged red necks. They spend over 800k a year on off road racing and are the most conditional people I\u2019ve ever met. I have my concerns with my daughter being raised around them (mainly because when my boyfriend was 15 the step dad choked him out and the mom stayed with the guy) they are both short tempered and throw things and are constantly emotionally abusive. Not to mention if they knew their son was bisexual they\u2019d probably disown him. They don\u2019t deny choking my boyfriend out as a minor, they try to defend themselves by saying \u201cwell he wouldn\u2019t pick up the dog shit\u201d \nThey do other things that bother me too like they never supported my daughters neck as a newborn and they would prop her BM bottles that I would pump with a blanket in her car seat.\nLong story short in the beginning I was pumping breast milk bottles because they were SO against me breast feeding and wanted to feed her. I finally came to my senses exhausted and realized I shouldn\u2019t give a shit what they want she is my baby and started nursing her on demand. She gained a lot of weight since and her pediatrician is very pleased. Needless to say it was the end of the world to them \u201cto never be able to feed their grand baby again\u201d even though I had half a mind to look at the step dad and say \u201cshe has two grandpas and you aren\u2019t one of them get over it\u201d but instead I held my tongue /: \nThe grandma/MIL is CRAZY. She hates and neglects her own son but is OBSESSED with my daughter. Calling her \u201cthe second chance baby\u201d and the \u201cdaughter she never had\u201d (she thought she was having a girl and out  came my boyfriend) he is an only child and because of that thinks my baby should be an only child and constantly tells me I better not have another baby. The first few months she was born they didn\u2019t care so much but now that she\u2019s bigger I constantly find her taking her away from me any chance she gets. (I guess the first few months my boyfriend was born she had a spinal headache from the epidural and didn\u2019t even hold him or take care of him, instead the dad did everything until it went away and even then she was always leaving him with his grandparents so she could go drink at the bar and find a new man which she did. All she cares about is money) Anyways now that my daughter is about the size her son was when she finally took care of him (she\u2019s only 4  months old) she is always shooing me and my boyfriend to go away and let her take care of her. \nShe would slip time after time and call MY daughter her baby and while talking to her would refer to herself as \u201cMommy\u201d. And she would ONLY correct herself while I was standing there. But the most recent 2 times I heard her say it she did not correct herself because she thought I couldn\u2019t hear her. I pretended not to hear her and told my boyfriend my concerns when we were alone and he defended her...\u201dwouldn\u2019t you want to make believe that you were a mom again when you\u2019re that old?\u201d \nI just shook my head HE NEVER DEFENDS ME AS A MOM. I finally got fed up with all her crazy behavior. Constantly telling us what products we could or couldn\u2019t use, to let the baby sleep with a blanket, make sure she\u2019s warm to the point of sweating while sleeping, put rice cereal in a bottle, YOU NEED TO PUMP SO I CAN WATCH HER, don\u2019t take pictures of her naked, feed her baby food at 4 months old, blah blah blah\u201d I just got so sick of it. I finally told my boyfriend \u201ceither tell her to stop telling us how to raise our daughter or I will\u201d\nNext thing she started obsessing over was sleepovers. She expects me to pump 6 bottles to let her stay the night. When I told her no she was furious \u201cmy sons grandma got him for a sleep over once a week you kids need some alone time or time to rest\u201d but she doesn\u2019t realize 1. I can\u2019t pump that much 2. I would just be worried the whole time because she DOES NOT know how to take care of a baby. \nI finally told her to get her to stop that she could start watching her when I was done breast feeding at 1 years old. \nThat was until I found out about all the abuse and neglect that she dealt my boyfriend growing up and allowing the step dad to hurt him. I no longer trusted her to even watch her for an hour. She started pushing me every chance she got buying us gift cards, movie tickets and even tried to send us out of state to Disney land. I keep asking her what she could possibly need us to be away for? What is it she can\u2019t do with us being in the same house? She gets to see her at least once a week and we always go do something around the house when she\u2019s with the baby so they can bond. It really seems suspicious to me . She then DEMANDED that at one year old she gets her every Friday and for a sleep over on Saturday and my boyfriend actually agreed to it knowing I don\u2019t even trust her for an hour and considering all the abuse the age (no matter how old she is) doesn\u2019t matter to me. I won\u2019t let my daughter get abused or emotionally put down by these people. I even told my mom that she couldn\u2019t watch her alone because it\u2019s not fair and very reasonably agreed saying \u201cI\u2019m just happy to see her. Your rules are your rules \u201c\nSo something just didn\u2019t seem right. But it got worse every holiday and first time experience my MIL has completely taken over. Fourth of July she wouldn\u2019t let me hold her during the fireworks, Father\u2019s Day got spent with the step dad instead of my boyfriend. She gave her the first bath and even took her to her first restaurant. I bit my tongue. But this most recent time was the last straw. \nIt was our first time (mine AND the baby\u2019s) going to a pumpkin patch and surprise my boyfriend invites his mom and all her friends. I didn\u2019t even get to push the stroller. I had to hear all day about how she\u2019s buying the baby a pony and putting her in a private school (without even consulting me and my boyfriend or putting HER OWN SON through school, starting to think she never wants him to be successful so she can have the baby sigh) but the grain of rice that tipped the scale was still to come... we ate and I fed the baby with my nursing cover after being told it \u201cwasn\u2019t appropriate to feed her in public even with a nursing cover\u201d I got nasty looks from all her friends. My boyfriend took a picture with everyone holding the baby except for me. When his mom kept pushing the stroller she said \u201csorry I should let you push this\u201d finally! I was going to get to be the mom in the situation my boyfriend encourages her : \u201cno no it\u2019s okay mom it\u2019s your first time being here as a grandma! \u201c even though she took her son every year since he was 11 months old \nI couldn\u2019t believe it . My boyfriend goes on to say he wants to spend quality time with me, even though he knew I wanted to enjoy the pumpkin patch as a family for the first time. \nMy MIL looks over and the tractor won\u2019t let strollers on and offers to watch the baby for 10 minutes while we go pick a pumpkin and my boyfriend goes against my wishes and agrees trying to be sexually flirty on the tractor. I\u2019m so pissed at him I can\u2019t even enjoy myself. We get back and the baby is asleep his mom saying \u201cshe\u2019s been my little angel the whole time\u201d at this point I just want to go home. We finally leave and the baby isn\u2019t even hungry which I find odd.at this point she hasn\u2019t eaten in 4 hours.... when we get home I try to feed her and she won\u2019t eat. She wouldn\u2019t even eat before bed. Something wasn\u2019t right. (She always nurses before bed) \nFinally at 2 in the morning I wake up to her screaming covered in brown and yellow throw up. I immediately wash her and change her diaper which is filled with bloody diarrhea. I phone a 24/7 nurse and ask what to do, tears in my eyes and her screaming\nShe said if it continued to bring her to the ER \nI try to nurse her and she had no idea what to do and just kept puking. All night this happened. She had sunken eyes and looked pale and dehydrated. Her mouth was dry. On the phone with the nurse she finally decided to nurse and I had the hardest time getting her to eat. But finally around 7 am she was back to her normal color and had normal breast milk poop again (no blood) the nurse tells me to keep an eye on her and that she should be okay but if anything continues to bring her in right away or call 911\nRelieved she finally settles down and looks happy again. After a nap she wakes up, and eats somewhat. I put her in her bouncy seat to play while I cook breakfast. I can\u2019t find her elephant toy, so I look in her stroller. As I open it an empty container of premade on the go similac formula pops out. I\u2019m furious... \nI tell my boyfriend about it and he finally agrees she\u2019s gone to far but claims because they have more money than us the court would take her away. That was a week ago and he hasn\u2019t put out a single job application. I\u2019m ready to leave and go live with my mom in California but very horrified at the idea of going to court over visitation and afraid I won\u2019t be given permission to leave the state. \nMy MIL gave my baby a bottle behind my back and made my baby sick all night (potentially with an allergic reaction) and she will not stop calling and asking if she can see her. Anytime I post a picture of her on Facebook within 2 minutes she will call to ask what we\u2019re doing with the baby and to talk smack about my mom coming to town or just begging her son to let her watch the baby or to talk about how she\u2019s going to have her own room with her own bed at grandmas and \u201cwill never want to leave\u201d. \n\nWhat are my options here? What can I do within my rights in the state of Arizona? How can I keep this crazy abusive lady away from my defenseless baby? And am I wrong to stay with her dad? \nHe won\u2019t get a job, smokes pot all day (YES, he spends our money on that ) and doesn\u2019t even hold the baby. His name is on the birth certificate and I don\u2019t have a car.  He says because I won\u2019t have sex with him every single day he won\u2019t work. So he sleeps in until 5-6pm and stays up all night smoking pot and jacking off while I\u2019m taking care of the baby 24/7 I get food stamps and cash assistance from the state that he mooches off of and tells me constantly we can\u2019t spend any money on the baby because he\u2019d rather accept hand outs from our friends and family.\nWhat should I do? PLEASE any input would be greatly appreciated. I just want my baby and I to be safe and happy. Thanks!",

On Skype I was telling him about the date, and he said that he does not want her dating at all until she graduates high school.  I know that us as parents have to accept that she\u2019s growing up.  I also told him that I might put her on birth control when she feels ready to be sexually active;  he said this is just giving her an opportunity to go out and have sex with whoever she wants. \n\n I completely disagree with my husband.  Providing birth control is teaching safe sex; and usually sex is in the spur of the moment, so I want her to be prepared, whether thats now or 10 years from now. I was never allowed to date until after HS and I feel as if that robbed me from certain experiences that would\u2019ve helped me later down the line (e.g dealing with heartbreak). \n\n He also says that a boy will be distracting to school work and that he doesn\u2019t want her to become obsessed.  Our daughter is a straight A student and teachers only say good things about her.  Now if she starts dating someone and her grades go down then that would be an issue, but I don\u2019t think it will be.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want her dating at all, but I don\u2019t want her to miss out on fun.

        "content": "UPDATE 8/21/18: Looking at the same situation from a different (much shorter) angle, how would you feel about your 3rd or 4th grader being in class with a child with a porn addiction?  Do you think you, as a parent, have a right to know so you have the chance to speak with your kids about it on your own terms? \n\nUPDATE 8/22/18: I spoke with his mom and he starts therapy this week. \n\n\n\n\nWhat would you do if you found out the little boy (8yo) across the street didn't just talk about sex with your 7yo daughter but demonstrated sex using a pillow?  \n\nThe way I found out was equally disturbing. My daughter asked me some questions that made me think, \"oh wow, I'm not ready to have the birds and the bees talk!\" but we talk and it's going ok when she tells me she's not a virgin. I asked her why she thinks that and she said because she cuddles with her pillow sometimes...like 'Sam' does. (changed his name)...  That's when I learn about him showing my kids and his younger siblings how to have sex and that he watches it on the computer. \n\nThe next day I go over and talk to his mom who tells me they've been dealing with his 'insomnia' for a while and one of the things they discovered was he was getting on the computer at 2:00 am and searching 'woman big boobs' and other words that would seem dirty to an eight year old kid. You don't have to be a wordsmith to find porn on the internet though, and the stuff that's out there today is disturbing even to adults. I can't begin to imagine the effect it will have on someone his age. \n\nIt wasn't until after they caught him that they put parental controls on but then they caught him asking to visit Grandma more...same thing there. Every time he got caught he would find another house and use their internet. Every time he came to our house he would search all over for the kids tablets or try to get on our computer. The kids don't have internet on their tablet plus we have the rule of no electronics when playing with friends. I never let any kid ever use my computer but the way he zones everything out looking for anything with an internet connection is very disturbing...like an animal in heat. One time he even snatched it back and growled when my husband went to take the iPad from him. (The iPad I hid from him specifically that he searched my house for, because even before I knew about the porn I knew he would make a b-line for the iPad) There are so many issues with this kid  but it feels like my husband and I are the only ones taking this seriously. Are we blowing this out of proportion? \n\nMy kids are no longer allowed to play in their house and he's not allowed to play with any kids alone, inside or outside (my rules, not his parents). If he's there, I'm watching them. His mom knows it's an issue but she thinks the issue is mine to deal with. She'll ask if my daughter can spend the night with her daughter then assure me her son is spending the night with another friend so it's 'safe'... Why is she helping my kids avoid him instead of addressing the issue? My rules are in place because that's what's in my power to control. It's like I'm an OR Nurse and his mom is the surgeon and I'm packing the wound and using suction after she clipped an artery, and instead of fixing the lacerated artery she's handing me more sponges... Fix the problem! I'll do my job but she has to do hers. \n\nTL;DR    \nThe question is, can his words or actions hurt my kids?  Psychologically and emotionally, yes. Physically, possibly. \n\nWhat can I do to protect them?\n\nUpdated to add that they live across the street so the kids can hear them playing outside and want to go play outside too. It's not fair to keep my kids inside when they should be outside getting fresh air. This is a serious delimma we've discussed because they are young kids who like playing outside and their outsides overlap.",

        "content": "I'll start off by saying I know we screwed up, and this will probably be solved by ripping the band-aid off, but I'm looking for anyone who has gone through a similar experience.  Like I said, I know we screwed up, but there are reasons for what happened.  My wife or I have been sleeping in our son's room at night for years now.  Started at 3, and he's now 9.  I'm finally done with grad school, its summer break, so this mess is ending now.  But how to go about doing it?\n\nMy son had absolutely awful reflux when he was born.  Spit up all the time, screamed - not cried, SCREAMED - from about 6-7pm until 1-2am for the first 3-4 months of his life.  My wife and I were utterly shell-shocked.  We still look back in horror about those days even now.  It was a fucking nightmare.  Lots of talks with pediatrician, finally got on Zantac around 3 months in and it slowly started helping.  So the long stretch of non-stop screaming ended.  But putting him to bed was still like trying to put down an unstable bomb.  The slightest sound or creak would wake him and he'd cry and cry and cry.  Letting him cry it out never worked, because he never stopped.  He'd cry until he threw up everywhere, then cry more.  Getting him into bed at night became an art for me, my wife and my mom.  But we got good at it eventually.\n\nAs he got older other problems arose.  The little booger is an excellent climber and was escaping his crib before he could walk.  We eventually had to lower the mattress to the floor so he couldn't scale it anymore.  When we moved him to a toddler bed...well, there was nothing holding him back.  He's just get up and get out, following us and either laughing or crying.  It would take a concerted effort for 1-3 hours every damn night to get him to stay in bed.  My wife joked that this was my fault because I never want to go to bed.  You have to find the laughs somewhere.\n\nOur biggest mistake came when he was 3 and got a stomach bug that last for days.  Poor kid had constant issues with reflux to begin with, but this was a LOT of freaking vomit.  We were up all night for several nights.  Got really concerned about him getting dehydrated.  Finally one very sleep deprived night we took him to our bed.  He got better in a couple of days, but we made a new discovery - in our bed he went right to sleep!  No more evenings spent fighting for hours!  We faked going to bed and got up to party!  It was WONDERFUL!  No more exhausted evenings full of fighting!  Movies, games, sex all over the house!  What a time to be alive!\n\nAfter about a year of this we knew we should probably get him back to his room, but he didn't want to.  We kept telling ourselves, next summer, next time we have vacation, next blah blah blah.  When he was 5 he wanted a bunk bed, so we got him one on the condition he went back to his room.  Well, fate intervened to keep him away from his bed longer.  To try and speed this up, there were some scumbags renting the house diagonally across from our house and his bedroom.  One night there was a shootout from all the criminals in that house.  Every surrounding house was filled with bullets except ours.  Luckily no one was hurt, but there was no fucking way he was going to go back to his room now!  Our community and the city government worked together to get those fuckers kicked out/arrested (they were renting), and we moved our son back to his room.  But he wouldn't go, not alone.  So I went with him.  \n\nThat was three years ago roughly.  At times I've been in there, at other times my wife is in there.  Usually she is so tired from work that she goes to bed at the same time he does.  In this time I completed grad school to become a NP, and we've had a little girl.  She's 2 now and everything about her sleeping has been easy as possible thank God.  We're expecting massive push back from him, which is why we didn't do it while I was in school.  Too much damn homework every night.  He's absolutely terrified of being alone at night.  He doesn't care if his sister sleeps alone, or if his friends do.  There is no shaming him out of this.  He wakes up every morning all alone in his room after one of us has left and that doesn't bother him.  It's the whole process of going to bed...just like it always has been with him.\n\nHe has stuffed animals, lucky stuffed animals, a Minecraft torch night light, other night lights that go out after an hour or two.  He's still scared unless we're with him.  We live in an extremely quiet, safe neighborhood (minus the jerks from years ago that he doesn't even know about).  He doesn't watch scary movies or play bad games.  I know this is all our faults but I'm here looking for ideas.  Have any of you experienced something similar, and how did you solve it?\n\nThanks",

        "content": "Posted on relationships sub but got locked. A mod adviced to post here.\n\nI'm asking for advice here because I don't want anyone I know or knows my daughter to know any of this. For the record, my husband died of cancer when Amy was 2 years old.\n\nMy daughter Amy has been dating her boyfriend Harry for about 9 months. I don't know the specifics about how they met, I think it was through mutual friends. As far as I know, this is Amy's first serious relationship.\n\nHarry is the sweetest joung man I've ever met. I met him a few days before Halloween last year when he was helping Amy with some homework. He introduced himself and was really polite (and really nervous), and he just seemed really nice, made an effort to talk to me and all that. Amy told me he's an engineering student like herself, and really smart. He stayed for dinner and left after. I asked Amy if she liked him and she said they had been going out for two months or so.\n\nI've been seeing Harry around the house since, and I really like him. He's smart and nice and I think he really cares for Amy. He's always helping her with homework, gives her small gifts, I've overheard some bits of conversation, and well, I can see the way he looks at her. I know that's not of my business and aside from asking a few questions and a talk here and there (safe sex, boundaries, all that), I didn't pry. I'm just happy that he treats my daughter with respect and love.\n\nThat said, I've noticed something in the last four months or so. Of course this is from an outside perspective and I'm missing a lot of details, but I think my daughter is treating Harry really bad, even abusing him. The first time I noticed something, they were watching a movie on the couch. I try to give them space so usually I go to the study or my bedroom, or go out. I was walking by the living room and I heard Harry asking Amy something and Amy said \"f*** off, you are so annoying\". I don't think the tone was that of banter. Since then, there have been more instances of this behaviour. Harry saying something and Amy telling him to f*** off or to shut up, calling him idiot, stupid, ugly, disgusting... I don't know how did this happen, Amy has NEVER shown any behaviour like this. She doesn't treat her friends like this.\n\nI admit that since I started noticing this, I have eavesdropped a few conversations between them, and there's nothing Harry says to set Amy off, I've heard her calling him a f***ing loser just because Harry asked her to go out on a saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry keeps being sweet and nice to her, even more than when I first met him. I haven't even heard him cursing, much less insulting Amy (I would kick him out in a heartbeat), so either he's really good at hiding it, or he's not doing it at all.\n\nI don't know if I should say something. On the one hand, Amy is my daughter and I feel like I should side with her and I don't know the whole story. On the other, as far as I know Harry has done nothing to diserve this kind of treatment and I sorry for him.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nTLDR: Daughter's boyfriend is really nice to her and me, daughter treats him awful.",

        "content": "6 year old boy. Divorced for 4 years. Prior to 2 years ago, I was pretty consistent in his life. I was the every other weekend dad. It worked out great until I lost my job so I made a change and now I am gone a lot. When I am in town it is usually for just a day or two and then I am out again. \n\nI do facetime and call when I can but I am not able to check in daily. \n\nMy ex wife now has almost full custody and makes all the decisions regarding his care since I can't often be reached to consult with. Our decree says she gets final say in all decisions not already outlined in the custody agreement anyway. \n\nMy son and I are growing a little apart. I use to be his best friend and now, although he is glad to see me, he much prefers his mom. \n\nI am not the best dad in the world. I never really connected to children at all. I love my son and I love playing with him outside and stuff but I don't know what to do when he skins his knee or needs to go to the doctor or what the schools needs me to bring. My dad was a pretty cold and firm guy and I feel like I might be the same. He was always about lessons and structure and being proud of your hard work almost to a fault. It was also a very religious and gender structured household and I still believe in those same things. \n\nMy ex wife is the exact opposite. But she works a full time and from what I understand busy job that she has basically dedicated her whole life to while also raising our child solely (she hasn't remarried). \n\nI don't really get too keen of a look into what they do day to day but on a recent visit I did get a small look into what they do when I was able to stay the night at their house. \n\nI will be honest and admit that I don't really have much room to talk here. I have visited maybe 12 days last year. That is 353 days that she had to do everything related to our son on her own. \n\nI get that it can be tough and obviously I couldn't do it. I do appreciate all she does but I also think I am allowed to be concerned and ask questions about certain things just to make sure that everything is going smoothly for them.\n\nMy ex changed her work schedule to fit our son's school/daycare schedule which is great that she can but it means she often has to work from home late into the night. My son has about 10 tardies at school because they have overslept because she is running late.He is in kindergarten so I am not sure if that is a big deal. \n\nHe often gets himself up to get breakfast instead of her waking up first. He has an alarm clock in his room and gets up and greats dressed and goes down and pulls a premade breakfast out of the fridge (she makes them the night before and he can use the microwave - is that normal?) and eats it while she wakes up and gets ready. He runs through his own checklist before they head out the door. It is written on a wall next to his things right beside the door. \n\nHe even selects his own premade (she makes his lunches on sundays and he pulls them out of the fridge with a snack from the cupboard and puts it in his bag). So she never really knows what he is going to choose that morning. I asked her what he was having today and she had no idea. She just said that is one of the four things she made or he can skip that and buy a lunch (she puts money on his account through an app.) She said they keep a print out of the food that is being served by the school on the fridge and he can choose a premade lunch or just decide to buy a lunch. \n\nThat morning I was there I think they only saw each other when he popped into her bathroom to tell her he was ready and had eaten and she reminded him to brush his teeth which he went and did on his own. Her bedroom is on the bottom floors, his is upstairs so they sleep pretty far apart. Her home office is on the second floor though so she did say she camps out in there when she has to work from home or at night. \n\nShe did check his breath when they met at the door to leave and that was the first time I saw them stand together that morning. She said they catch up in the car on the way to school. \n\nShe leaves work at 1:30 to go get him so she doesn't have to pay for daycare but has to work from home 2:30 on. \n\nThey apparently get home around 2 and snack together until 2:30 where she goes upstairs to work (2:30 to 3:30) and he goes to his room for alone time. She says she doesn't really have any idea what he does but probably reads and plays, she says. He has an xbox so I know he plays that sometimes. Sometimes he will play in the fenced in backyard alone (she can see it from her window though). \n\nShe says she checks in about every 30 minutes which seems like a long time to go inbetween knowing what your six year old is up to. \nI asked her about it and she says they have been prepping for independence like this for a while and he knows all the rules and she trusts him to stay inside. \n\nIn her defense, he is a pretty safe kid. He knows where the fire extinguishers are and how to use them. They are small so he can hold one. She keeps her door open so she can hear him and he has never been the type of kid to open doors or do anything dangerous. \n\nBut I can't help but wonder if letting a six year old free reign the house is ok. I had older siblings that always watched me and we always had a full house of aunts and what not so if I got into any trouble someone always knew right away. \n\nThey both really like their privacy. Even when I visit my son, he always talks about needing some time alone. I am not sure how normal that is. \n\nMy ex wife has always been a really fair and concise person. And she was never one to baby talk. She has always talked to our child kind of like an adult. Not in an inappropriate way but she never treated him like there was something he really couldn't do on his own.Which I appreciate but my son has a way of talking that is very grown up. He knows about things I didn't know about until I was older, mostly anatomy and what to do if anyone ever does anything to him. He knows what sex is and how much money they have in their accounts. She regularly discusses the budget and money with him. I am not sure he fully grasps it but he knew what the food budget was when I talked to him. He said they needed some things, listed them and then said they only had so much to spend on those things. He knew how much their mortgage was and how much his mother made. Just numbers he learned I am sure that he is just repeating but still. \n\nHe told me he was hungry that afternoon and I told him I was get mommy but he said he had it. He walked over and got some food and popped it in toaster and then got a plate and took it out and then put the toast on the plate when it was done. Without even asking for help. \n\nThey have dinner together and then watch tv and then talk about all the stuff they have to do for next week and the weekend. If he has homework, he doesn't have a lot though, they do that together. \n\nAn alarm is set for his bedtime and he starts getting ready when it goes off by himself. She only joins him to make sure he brushed his teeth and read him a bedstory. He does like to cuddle so they cuddle until he falls asleep and then she works well into the night. \n\nI grew up in a stern household but all this scheduling just seems weird to me. A child getting up their own?\n\nI talked to my ex about it and she said that she found that when I left there was a lot of chaos and the only thing that worked was teaching him to be a little more independent. She claimed not to do it all at once but over the last two years she has set more and more things for him to do on his own and the end result is what they have now. She says he still asks for help from time to time and there is a lot he can't do yet but what not let him try. \n\nWhen he gets in trouble or fits too , she is quick to treat him like an adult. She tells him to go cool off somewhere (usually his room) or tries to talk to him about it. He mostly chooses to go to his room or outside and just sit by himself. He says he usually comes in to talk about it after a few minutes and they reconcile. I have seen him call her out on her behavior too, like I would. She encourages him to tell her when she is being unreasonable. \n\nI agree to an extent but I feel like maybe a lot of the stuff he is doing isn't age appropriate. Should a child really be alone like that? Should they play alone by themselves that much? Should they have responsibility like that? \n\n I asked him if he thought maybe made him do too much and he said he liked doing his things but he is six. \n\nIs this normal or should I sit her down and say this is all too much for him? I don't think she is bad mom and I know she loves him dearly, that boy adores her and she provides a pretty awesome life for him,  and I know she functions on a strict schedule but can a schedule ever be too much for a kid?  He feels to me like an adult more than a kid. I miss the kid he use to be when I was around more. \n\nHe is a real happy kid. He is just not really the type of kid I remember being at his age. I would have never remembered to grab a lunch. I would have never brushed my teeth on my own. \n\nI know I can't talk too much because I am not there a lot but is there a way I could help them? Do they need help or I am making a fool out of myself.",

        "content": "I have two kids from previous marriage, daughter-19 & son-15. I recently received a text from my daughter that she found out her stepdad has propositioned a couple of her friends to meet him somewhere with sexual intent. She now doesn't want to be around him any more than she has to. Obviously I said she can stay with us, no way I'm going to make her stay in a place she doesn't feel safe.\n\nI have my kids every weekend (fri-sun), and they both have their own rooms. I also have a toddler with my current wife, and we're expecting another next month. Full house to say the least.\n\nBack story of my previous marriage and why we broke up. She was cheating on me with the guy (now married to) for over a year. This was a decade ago. I walked in on them, and that was pretty much that. Now, I'm trying to make sure that I don't allow my negative feelings towards the two of them to make me biased as to what my daughter needs. I want to have her know and feel that she's safe here. That I don't influence her to do something I feel is the way to go, but that she chooses her own path. I know that's the best thing for her, but how do I make sure that I'm not projecting myself as a possible vengeful ex?\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nFirst, I want to thank all of the people who gave positive advice and thoughts. I used some of what you guys gave me, because it was indeed helpful. \n\nSo my wife and I had a good long talk with my daughter tonight, almost 3 hours. She showed us messages which her friend exchanged with the step-dad. He did this over FaceBook Messenger. What an idiot, right? So, after seeing those, it's absolutely irrefutable that he was propositioning her for sex, or some sort of physical relationship in exchange for money. The friend has *JUST* turned 18 a couple of months ago. My daughter has said that he has brought her up out of the blue from time to time (\"Hey, I think I saw [friend] the other day. How is she anyways?\") So, telling me he's been thinking about her friend while she was still a minor. Yeah, no surprise on my behalf.\n\nAfter our talk, I left it up to my daughter to decide how to handle things from here. Our door is open for her if she wants to walk through it. She decided to go back there tonight, since she won't be seeing him at all due to his work/sleep schedule. This is to not arise suspicion for the time being, until she talks with her mom. I told her she does indeed need to talk with her mom, and do it in the next couple of days before it gets to be too long. I said I was fine with telling her partial truths, but I do not condone lying to her just to avoid the \"talk\" for now. \n\nI told her that no matter what happens, this is **NOT** **HER** **FAULT**, and that after she tells her mom, whatever follows is her mom's decision. My daughter was concerned about her mom's financial situation, which ties in her brother and half-brother. I told her that she doesn't need to concern herself with those things, but to give some sort of relief of that stress, I said that's what child support and alimony is for and that it'll work out. Whatever her mom decides to do, the decision is hers and not my daughter's. All of her mom's decisions leading up to here which put her in a situation where she's dependent on him, as well as her decision to stay or leave after knowing this info, is solely on her mom's shoulders, and that my daughter does not need to carry that weight on her shoulders.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "She\u2019s 19, so she can make her own decisions and it sounds like she has. I\u2019d make it clear this has nothing to do with our animosity between you or your ex wife, and that your daughter deserves a comfortable living situation. Does your ex wife know what he did? Does your daughter plan on bringing it up to her? \n\nAlso, you have every right to protect your daughters well being no matter how uncomfortable it may make your ex or her husband. It sounds like what you\u2019re doing is for her, and just keep on that path without bringing up anything from you past.",

        "content": "Got a daughter who is 14, freshman in high school. Friday afternoon we found a note that she isn't coming home until tomorrow (yesterday) 1 pm. It told us not to worry, she is happy and safe, and she is sorry she hasn't been able to tell us about it. Last line was \"And if you're starting to worry, read this line again, I assure you I'm 100% safe.\"\n\nShe got back yesterday at noon. We'd been worried sick so we hugged her and asked her if everything is ok and where she had been. Turns out she was at a concert in another state. She hadn't been able to tell us because she didn't think we'd let her go.\n\nWe are of course relieved to have her back and my wife has begged her to please not do this again. She says she understands how worried we have been and feels bad about that, but she won't promise not to do it again. Then there's that she went to the concert with her boyfriend (who we weren't aware existed and who is a junior in high school) and 3 other boys that we never met. She says she'd been planning it for a week and a half and she bought the ticket to the concert from someone who couldn't go and they all slept in a tent. She says the boys all had permission to go and that the driver wasn't aware she didn't.\n\nWe're shocked. Her grades aren't slipping, her attendance is on top, she eats and sleeps well, and her mood is generally good. We never had much trouble from her, the only thing would be that after starting high school she doesn't open up to us anymore. It's only now after interrogating her we found out she has been seeing her boyfriend since the school start and the reason she hasn't told us about him is that she didn't want to disappoint us and didn't want us to worry about her or think she was being used. We asked if there is reason for us to be disappointed and she said he's probably not the kind of guy we'd imagine her with. At least he's not a criminal besides from maybe smoking weed, he's not violent and he treats her well, but she doesn't think it's good idea we meet him if we're going to be mad at him for being in on the plan. \n\nAs for the other boys she's been seeing them in and after school. Most days she is at someone's house or at the park or at the beach and we don't know everyone else who is there. When asked why she hasn't mentioned them she said they're a lot of kids who all hang out together. She doesn't know if we would approve of them. They're not all honors students but they aren't reckless. When asked about drinking she didn't deny nor confirm. When told we're concerned for her safety and well-being, she said she doesn't want us to be concerned for her, and that she hates telling us stuff because we always think she's so innocent and holy that we're going to think she got pressured into anything she's done that we don't approve of, and that she can't stand the thought of us thinking she is pressured into everything.\n\nOk. What stuff is it she does? She doesn't smoke, but her boyfriend does. When asked what she likes about him, she said he's interesting to talk to but of course everyone would just roll their eyes at that and say he is smooth talking her. When asked of they're sexually active, she asked if we'd assume he's pressuring her into sex of they are. When asked if she feels ready for sex, she asked if we'd be disappointed if she does (not in a defiant way). \n\nWe told her we want to meet the kids she is hanging out with and talk to their parents. She's currently in her room thinking over if she wants to give us their numbers or if we need to ask the school for them. But what do we say to them? And what consequences do we give her? How terrible is what she did on the teenager scale of terrible? When asked what consequences she expected for doing what she did she said she has no idea. When asked if she doesn't care if she gets consequences she says it would suck if she was grounded until she is 18 for both her and for us but it was worth it and she doesn't regret it, concert was great and she had best time in her life. Where do we go from here? It seems our kiddo is maybe drinking and having sex and she is willing to run away for a concert. How do we deal with her friends and boyfriend? Should we tell her she may not see them again? Should we ground her and take all electronics? Or should we take a more gentle approach?",

They're either out doing something in the city or they're at her place. It isn't like I never see him. I've had them both over for dinner several times and I've had her family over for dinner too, but when they're just hanging out they pick her apartment. \n\nI asked my son why that is and he said it's because she feels watched here. I don't hover over them at all but I don't exactly know what to do in regards to closed doors as she is 13. I suppose she catches onto that. In her home nobody watches them. First off her parents have careers and work late so they are alone a lot of the time. Secondly, they're very relaxed and easy-going. I can't really picture either one of them exerting authority. They're also very warm and loving people so I can see why she likes being at home.\n\nThe other weekend when I did have them over they watched a movie in the living room while cuddling on the couch. Afterwards I said she may spend the night and offered a spare mattress. They discussed a little while I was in the kitchen and then decided to go and sleep at her house. I suspect that's because they both sleep in the same bed at her house. My son says he can stay over there any time and her parents haven't even laid down any rules for sleep-overs. I have btw talked to him about safe sex and he tells me not to worry. \n\nSo I would love for my son and also his girlfriend to spend a bit more time at my house and not always be at her house, but I don't know how to make my apartment as attractive as hers is. My son says that his girlfriend likes me but feels a bit paternalized by me (well I am a parent). I don't know how to not make her feel that way when I'm obviously being compared to her own parents who treat her as an equal. \n\nFor what it's worth, my son and his girlfriend are both doing great in school and keeping up with their hobbies. I'm not concerned about either one of their health, I just want to see my son a little more. What would you do in this situation? Loosen up a little more?",

        "content": "I adopted my daughter from an abusive family member when she was 6 months old. There's no brighter light in my life. Admittedly, I made a rush decision in adopting her, I just wanted her out of that house. Many of my other family members were on the side of her father, and I didn't get a lot of help in parenting her. So, my parenting style is very unique. It's how I wished I'd been raised. But, it works well for us. We have a lot of trust in each other. She tells me everything, and I don't try to micromanage her decisions. I just give her tools to make choices on her own. She told me that she's been drinking at parties, I just tell her about date rape drugs, drinking and driving. When she told me she was having sex, I got her condoms and BC, taught her about safe sex, consent, and coercion. I can't manage her every second of the day. And if I just tell her no, she'll still do it anyways. It's so much more important to me that she knows how to be safe while she's doing something, and later be able to make the choice of whether or not to do it, then to make one risky decision and never be able to make another choice again. I know that my daughter and her boyfriend have sex. I know that she sometimes smokes weed. I know that she drinks. I'm okay with that. I can't stop it.\n\nEvery year, just after Christmas, my daughter goes with 5-8 of her friends and a chaperone (a friend's mom) to a cabin in the woods. I trust them to go. There has never been any behavior that I feel would put her at risk. During their trip, they all put their phones in a bucket, and don't get to touch them until they leave. It's a \"wilderness bonding activity.\" Honestly, I appreciate it. Again, nothing sketchy about it, it's just kind of like camp. Anyways, my daughter left two days ago. Last night, she called me. I was really worried, so of course, I answered right away. She seemed confident and okay. She told me that she'd been sitting on some information for a while, and she felt horrible about not telling me. I asked if she was okay, she said she was fine, just pregnant by her boyfriend. I asked if he had coerced her, or assaulted her. She said no, they'd just forgotten a condom.\n\nI asked what her plan was, and she said she was going to keep it, and try to finish out high school while pregnant. She asked what I thought, and I said I didn't know, because I don't. I asked if she had proof, and she said there was an ultrasound in her sock drawer. Sure enough, there it was. I let her go back to her camping trip, and now I've just been thinking. Is this on me? Should I have put my foot down a while ago? Obviously, I'm going to try to support her and give her a roof over her head, but what do I do? What can I say?",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "At 17 you are right in that it is hard to stop them from doing anything they set their minds to.\n\nYou can try and they will do it anyway, or you can try to equip them to make good decisions and hope the lessons you have taught have sunk in. In this case it didn't work out.\n\nYou did what you thought was best.  It's easy to be critical after the fact, but there are plenty of overly strict parents who have teens end up pregnant too. At least you have a daughter who trusted you enough to come to you with the situation.\n\nYou can't change the past, so work on your future.  You have to make sure she finishes school, even if it puts additional work on you.  You have to sit down with her and go over how much things cost for a baby. Figure out where that money is coming from. Get the father's family involved too. Make sure he pays his fair share.",

        "content": "I\u2019m kind of beside myself right now, not because I expected him to NEVER look at it, but I didn\u2019t expect it at this age. I (mom) was snooping on my 8yo son\u2019s iPad because I\u2019ve noticed lately he\u2019s been very hesitant to hand it over when he\u2019s had a problem with it, and found a porn-laden browser history. Try as I might to convince myself someone must have hacked him, maybe another device\u2019s history somehow populated on his iPad... deep down, I know it\u2019s actually him. I have no idea how to handle this or what to say. Moreover, his father and I are divorced and I don\u2019t know whether to tell his dad. I know if I do, his dad will tease him about it mercilessly for years, and I don\u2019t want him to have to deal with that. My gut reaction for the entire situation is to be angry, but I mean... sex is normal, and I don\u2019t want to scare him, I just want him to know it\u2019s too early. Do I confront him? Take away the iPad all together? Hide Safari permanently? Ugh, please help.\n\n**UPDATE: While we were on a drive to the store, I talked to him (to be fair... I thought it might be easier if we weren\u2019t looking each other in the eye). I told him he wasn\u2019t in trouble but that what I saw he had been looking at wasn\u2019t age-appropriate. He tried to deny it at first (I could literally hear his throat drying up while he tried to say \u201cI didn\u2019t... I don\u2019t know what you mean\u201d), but then admitted he googled some stuff after hearing it referenced on TV. It was something innocuous enough... commercial with two topless-looking people in bed together. He said he was just curious and wanted to see what the big deal was. I explained to him that what he saw isn\u2019t \u201creal life\u201d and isn\u2019t like sex in real life. Borrowed from an article I found... I told him I know he and his dad have fun playing wiffle ball in the backyard sometimes. Expecting sex in real life someday to be like sex in the videos he saw is expecting a Red Sox game at Fenway and finding him and his dad playing wiffle ball in the backyard. I told him sex is a natural part of adult life and that looking up isn\u2019t WRONG and it wasn\u2019t bad to be curious, but that it\u2019s not safe for an 8 year old kiddo. It also gave me a chance to reiterate a brief casual (but unrelated) convo we had last week about respecting others and consent. At the end of the conversation, I said he could ask me or his dad if he had any questions or needed to know something and then told him that I love him and he needs to start sleeping in a jar to keep him tiny ala bonsai kitty.

        "content": "My ex husband and I (30F) have been separated/divorced since she was around 2 years old. He had major alcoholism that 2 rounds of rehab could not fix, as well as cheated on me constantly and raped me drunk one night and refused to stop doing cocaine.  He got 3 days a week custody which mostly involved my daughter going to his moms for 3 days and seeing him for a few hours at a time. \nWhen my daughter was 4 years old, she told me her biological father had put his fingers inside her while she was laying on her belly. I took her to the hospital, she told  a forensic child psychologist what happened in detail, and Child Protective Services made a finding of sexual abuse against him. During the investigation, he was granted supervised visits at his parents house where he physically abused her, left bruises which were also documented by the police. \n\n\nWe had a 3 year court battle during which the courts determined that the timeline of her story was too inconsistent and decided not to charge him with a crime. They also said the physical abuse was terrible but not illegal since our state allows corporal punishment and there are no specific definitions of what that is. \nA GAL investigated his life and recommended visits could not happen at his house as it is unfit for a child, and that he go to rehab a 3rd time. I got primary custody and he went to rehab. \nA reunification plan was made that involves him first having 6 months of supervised visitation then visitation at his parents house then unsupervised visitation every other weekend with overnights. This started in August. \nMy daughter has been in therapy for the last 3 years. She has never discussed the abuse in detail with her therapist beyond \"my dad used to hurt me\" or something equally vague. \nRecently she has been seeing him in public places supervised by her grandfather. I bring her to the place, bring her in, and they stay there for 2 hours once a week and then I pick her up. \n\n\nMy whole life is dedicated to making sure she's ok. I bring her to weekly therapy, do her homework with her, meet her at the bus stop, take her to piano and sports lessons, cook her great meals, and do family activities on the weekends.  She has friends over twice a week and doesn't really have any behavioral problems. Doesn't have tantrums or get angry. Doesn't have bad dreams.  Does whine a lot but I don't think that's abnormal. Her teacher suspects she may have an attention problem though as she has a hard time staying on task and paying attention, and her teacher reports she does not make safe choices. Overall, I haven't felt like her abuse affected her that much and haven't seen evidence of her acting out as a result. \n\nMy husband and I are currently trying to get pregnant and our family friend/neighbor also just announced her pregnancy.  So she has been asking a lot of questions about pregnancy lately including how babies are made. Last month. After pestering me for a few weeks I decided to tell her some matter of fact information, that men and women have different genetalia, that a man puts his penis inside a woman's vagina and that is how she gets pregnant, and that it is only for adults. I also told her about periods. She asked a lot of questions about periods but didn't have any questions about sex. I told her if she wanted to talk about it more later or thought of any more questions to just let me know.  \n\nLast week, I went to a holiday event at her elementary school and came across a piece of writing that was hung on a wall. It was an \"all about me\" type of worksheet. She had written she loves singing, dancing, she had gotten lice once, and that her dad punched her in the privates. I took the page down off the wall and put it in my purse. I am intending to bring it up with her therapist tomorrow. I asked her about it and she didn't want to talk about it and thought her teacher wouldn't show anyone. (Her teacher said she didn't read it before she hung it up, wtf). \n\nToday, she came into my room and asked what our zip code is. I told her and she went back into her room. She came back out and asked another questions about zip codes. I asked her what this was about and she said nothing. She's not allowed to use the Internet on her iPad except for facetiming her Grammy, so I asked her where all of this was coming from and to bring her iPad into my room. She started crying and brought it in. She had been looking up sex videos. For the last few days.  Her searches were for, \"what does pinus look like\" and \"cool sex videos\" which brought up some horrendous things like \"MILF with big tits likes it in the ass\". I'm sure she was not looking to stumble across that kind of hardcore stuff. She's only 7!\nShe went into her room and was crying as I looked at her history. I called her back out to my room and told her that this stuff was for adults only, not for kids. I asked her why she had looked it up, and she said she was wanted to know more. I said why didn't you talk to me? She said she wasn't sure. I told her we were going to take her iPad away since this was very inappropriate. \n\n(I understand that I screwed up here by not having the parental controls on the iPad totally locked down). I have since changed the wifi password so she doesn't have Internet access. \n\nShe has therapy every Monday so we will be bringing this up tomorrow. But I guess I'm just feeling overwhelmed. It seems to me that she is WAY TOO YOUNG to be looking up porn. Is this from the abuse? Is it because she has started seeing her dad again? Is it just simply curiosity (at age 7 though)? Is it because we had the talk? Did I give her the talk too soon? \n\nI know this is probably way above reddits paygrade. Raising a complicated kid doesn't come with any instructional manual.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Absolutely it\u2019s because of the abuse. She did nothing wrong. I am sure you didn\u2019t make her feel like she did something bad, but it\u2019s worth reminding her that she\u2019s not in trouble and didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\n\nIt is not too soon to give the talk. But the talk needs to include that her body belongs to her, and no one has a right to touch it. Even hugs from you, if she doesn\u2019t want them. It\u2019s totally okay for a kid to wonder about things.\n\nIMO, the more she knows, the safer and more comfortable she feels to come to you with concerns. And the more she understands that she\u2019s not at fault for anything she\u2019s experienced.",

        "title": "Snapchat and Social Media Lying",
        "content": "Hello, this is my first time posting here, but I read and lurk quite a bit. Over the weekend I was faced with a huge issue with the younger of my two girls (12). She is a very bright, very socially engaged young woman. She does excellently at school and has a multitude of friends. At home she has typical tween attitude with eye rolling and scoffing at us from time to time. We deal with that as it comes. She has a pattern of lying, behaving underhandedly, and two years ago we caught her stealing money from us. After about 6 months in therapy, it seemed to be better. She had a smartphone and then lost it, didn't tell us for 6 weeks that it was lost. She had a hand-me-down phone and she lost it again (over a year later), she got it back after a 4-month absence. We had set a rule for her with social media, that one, we had to preapprove any social media she wanted to engage in, that we could monitor it at anytime, and three, she was not allowed to open new social media accounts without our permission. I gave the go-ahead on Instagram, Pinterest, Whatsapp, Music.ly, and a few others like Polyvore, etc. I said no to Snapchat. A year ago she downloaded Snapchat against our wishes and decided to hide it from us (of course), we found out when older sister (age 16) told us.  I deleted the app, changed her password, and she did it again. This time I changed the iTunes password, I put major parent restrictions on her phone and talked with her about the risks of Snapchat and how it made me uncomfortable, how social media can be lots of fun, but you have to be careful with it, etc. We are pretty permissive parents overall, but her pattern behavior has suggested that she cannot be trusted.  \n\nFast forward to May of this year. She is/was using an iPhone 5S and it broke completely. The battery died, the screen shattered, and it stopped working. Rather than repairing it or buying her a new phone, we set up a plan for her to \"earn\" a phone (my old iPhone 6) with a point system. She was/has been doing amazingly well earning her points, she set herself on a schedule. In the meantime, she had asked to borrow my iPad to log on to Instagram. I said it was fine. She's been keeping in touch with her friends an video chatting via Google Hangouts (regular occurrence). On Sunday she had plans to attend a friend's bday party. Then I opened my phone and was looking through my photos because I wanted to show my husband something. I saw a bunch of screenshots of her chats with her friends. And a few Snapchats. In one of the screenshots, her user name on Snapchat had been modified to \"DaughtersFirstName_CUM waterdroplets, tongue emoji\". I was so taken aback. I am a very open mother with both girls, they both know about sex, the mechanics, etc. I don't want them to feel shameful about having sexual feelings and what not. But to have my child's name sexualized like that I was floored. So when I confronted her about it, she proceeded to tell me that a boy that she is connected to on Snapchat changed her name like that and then sent her the screen shot. I confirmed this with several of her friends. She said she was very upset about it and it really bothered her. We talked ad nauseum about responsibility, trust, how she did not have permission to use Snapchat, and one of my fears was that she would be harassed or engaged in a sexual predatory way. My husband and I went over how this was sexual harassment, and it was uncalled for and could be considered illegal. I reiterated with her that nobody gets to slut shame her, her body is her own, and she should never be okay with harassment like this. She really wanted to just \"sweep it under the rug\" because she was embarrassed. We talked about sexual relationships, about being safe, and that if she is considering becoming physical with someone it was important that she talk to me (us) without the fear or shame because feeling a sexual drive is natural and normal. \n\nWe then took the iPad away and reiterated the no Snapchat thing (didn't let her go to the bday party). Afterward, after much crying and sobbing on her part, she spent the rest of the day in her room. I went through her chats on Snapchat and all of it is pretty benign. And now I'm feeling uber guilty and awful for being so strict with her in the first place. Ironically enough, I had planned on talking with her about allowing the Snapchat once she earned her phone. But now I'm conflicted about standing my ground or allowing her access. The bigger issue is the lying and hiding, the smaller issue is that it was actually Snapchat. Any advice welcome!",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "You don't need to feel guilty. You set a boundary, told her explicitly what the boundary was and why it was there and she chose to lie to you and violate the boundary. It doesn't matter what the boundary was, you have rules for her safety and she broke one. As a result, a boy took advantage of her online persona and it blew up in her face. That's a natural consequence of having social media and she's old enough to understand.\n\nYou need to have a conversation about something entirely separate: when she gets in over her head, she needs to come to you for help. This isn't something that any 12-year-old is old enough to deal with on their own and she needs to be coached into coming to you for help when she needs it. Now, she won't be able to tell right away when she needs help and when she doesn't, but you need to encourage that dialogue.\n\nShe's been punished, I would keep the technology under close supervision, but not so that you can punish her when she breaks the rules. Explain why you're checking on her stuff and what good can come of communicating with you guys when something is happening that makes her unhappy.\n\nShe's getting to be the age where sexual pressure is coming from all sides and she needs to know that she can come to you and not get a lecture, but to get a hand up when she's drowning.",

        "content": "So my daughter Jessica (14) has left school because of bullying and she is being home tutored by: me on my days off work and my step sister when I'm at work. (My wife passed away when she was 9 months old so that is why she can't). I have a brilliant relationship with Jessica and she is always very open. We had just expanded on *the talk* and she knew what was happening with her body and not to be ashamed of it.\n\nBut yesterday my step sister had to go suddenly so she phoned me and I left work to go home, its a 25 minute journey so Jess would be on her own for 25 minutes. I was pulling into the driveway and I noticed that the front curtains where closed which they never are other than night time because we live in a safe area. So this raised suspision, as I got closed I could hear muffled noises coming from the main room. I decided it's best to quietly open the front door to see what was going on. I expected her to be munching away on some food watching telly instead of doing her work.\n\nBut I opened the door and the first thing I heard was sounds of sex. Panting, moaning, etc. She was naked on our sofa spread eagle masturbating with a vibrator (I never gave her one and had no idea she had one). I coughed loudly and she screamed jumped up covered herself with her hands and scrambled upstairs into her room. She left everything downstairs; her clothes, the vibrator and her laptop with porn still playing on it. I turned off her laptop, folded her clothes and put the soaking wet vibrator in a bag. I gave it an hour so she could come to the realisation of what she did, and went upstairs to her room with the clothes. I knocked on the door, no answer. I knocked again, still no answer so I crack open the door a bit and she is covered up in her bedquilt sitting in the corner of her room. I walk in and leave her clothes on her bed and say \"I'd like to talk about what just happened, when you are ready come downstairs please\" she didn't look at me but nodded her head and I left. \n\nShe eventualy came down and sat on the opposite side of the room to me still not looking at me. I told her that she can't do that in the living room and that anyone could have heard what she was doing. I said what she was doing was normal but it needs to stay in her room. She nodded again and asked if she could have her things back. I then asked where she got the vibrator, she said \"I don't want to say\" I told her \"we don't have secrets in this house, where did you get it\". She told me that my step sister was teaching her about the body and gave it her telling her what it was and not to tell me. I thanked her for telling the truth gave her the laptop back and told her not to be embarrased. I kept the vibrator and put it in the back of my wardrobe in a box (incase she goes looking for it).\n\nI am fine with her masterbating, I was her age and it was what I did in all my spare time. But not outside her room. I don't want my step sister to be alone with Jess if she is going to try and keep things from me. I know she's a teenager and she is going to have secrets but I don't feel like my step sister should be trying to encourage hiding things from me in my own house. Am I being to harsh or should I let it slide, and what the hell do I do with the vibrator. She's 14 is that too young, do I give it back. Help",

        "content": "Hey so I'm having trouble talking to my 13 year old daughter about sex.\n\nTo keep things short I'm a single dad and the mother died a few years ago. I was 13 when I had sex and we were both 14 when we had our daughter. Because of this it doesn't seem like anything I tell her is getting through. I know she's interested in boys now and she knows all about sex but when I tell her I don't want her to do it she just rolls her eyes or acts sarcastic. I've talked about safe sex with her but she brings up that me and her mom didn't use protection and \"everything worked out for us\".\n\nI don't think she's had sex yet but I'm frightened if she does she'll get pregnant or she'll try to get pregnant. We've always had a good relationship and she hasn't really ever talked back to me like this until recently. I don't know what to say to her to convince her not to have sex or to convince her to use protection. I'm completely stumped on what to say to her or what to do.\n\nThank you if anyone can help.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "Could she babysit any babies? Preferably not too cute and well-behaved toddlers, but little babies that need their diapers changed. \n\nIf I were you, and this is just my personal opinion, I would drop the telling her \"I don't want you to have sex\". Many teenagers don't like being told what their parents want them to do, they don't like the feeling they are being controlled. Instead, I'd bring the focus to \"if you are going to have sex, you will need to handle the consequences\". Then bring her detailed information on the consequences of sex, especially unsafe sex. Share the *details* of how hard it was for you to have her that young. Teenagers can't just imagine everything they have no experience with, they need details to understand, preferably even some experience which is why I'd recommend having her change some diapers also.\n\nThen make sure she has easy access to birth control, not just access, it has to be convenient and easy for her to get it. I personally would put condoms not just in her drawers at home but also in her backpack. Also discuss with her if she wants to start on birth control. Let her know you can make the appointment with the doctor so it's nothing she needs to fix by herself (these things can be a bit overwhelming and embarrassing for young teens). All she needs to do is have a little talk with the doctor with or without your present (whichever she prefers) and then she can have birth control if she wants it.\n\nThen, I'd recommend to talk about her future, what she wants for herself. If she has some goals and plans for her future she is much less likely to think having a baby now is a good idea. Studies have shown that teenagers who have babies typically don't have other plans for their future. Try to find something she is passionate about and enjoys doing to make her less tempted to have a baby.",

        "title": "My daughter's dad accused her of being a pervert",
        "content": "My daughter is 9 and in the third grade. I have not been with her father, who is married now with two kids with his wife, since our daughter was about three months old. He also has a son who is slightly older than our daughter, and who also does not live with him. My daughter is my only child.\n\nShe normally would visit her dad every other weekend until a few months ago. This allowed her to see her siblings, and ideally see her dad.\n\nShe is very close to her older brother and, sadly, abhors her younger siblings. For whatever reason she has decided she does not like them. I don't know if it's because they see her dad every day, or what, but whenever she is around them she tries her damnedest to shut them out despite her dad trying to force her to like them. But around her older brother she wants to impress and hang out with just him. Her dad says she follows him around, looks for him if he's not in the room, prefers to sit next to him, etc. Of her younger siblings, I'm told she snubs them, which has lead to talks from both her parents. I don't have siblings, but I can understand that given the age difference between older brother and younger siblings, she'd be closer to him and not them. I also realize not everyone likes or even loves their siblings.\n\nHer dad has a completely different parenting style than I do, and when my daughter has come home from her dad's to say this or that, I have had to bite my tongue because I can't tell him his parenting skills are not the best and please just try to get on as best you can, honey.\n\nBut, up until a few months ago, shit hit the fan and he crossed a line that I'm having trouble dealing with. He called me during his weekend to tell me that our daughter was caught spying on her older brother while dressing, and therefore, she must have a crush on him. I was shocked and disconcerted that he implied that it went beyond simple curiosity, or the idea that our daughter wasn't thinking when she stood there. The problem is, her dad wasn't there when it happened. He heard it from his wife who said she heard it from the older son. He assured me he'd talk to her about boundaries, and I agreed to do the same when she came home the following day. \n\nWell, he didn't just talk to her about boundaries but asked her before the whole family, per his own confession, \"Do you have a crush on your brother!?\" to gauge the \"truthfulness\" of her reaction. She reacted poorly and said she did not have a crush on her brother. He is her brother! Yet, he took this as a sign that her reaction was made in guilt and it solidified any telling occurrences of her affection towards her brother being sexual in nature.\n\nHe broke her. He humiliated her. She cried for nearly a week. I can't wrap my head around the very idea of him going straight to something like this. I just can't imagine why.\n\nShe was dejected, ashamed, and confused thereafter. She refused to go back to his house until a couple of weeks ago. She visited for only the day, and didn't seem to enjoy her time.\n\nThen tonight her dad called for an impromptu meeting between the three of us to talk about what he can do to make things better when she visits. Well, let me tell you, that conversation lasted about an hour where I sat as a mediator while they talked it out. Then it circled back to \"the incident\" and he said he still feels she was being a creep, and that he doesn't feel it was her first time spying on a boy because he \"knows how kids are these days.\" Again, I was-am-shocked at the implication. He said he was pissed when he found out one of my daughter's school friends, a male, has spent the night as \"there's plenty of time in the late hours\" to do things. However, the classmate slept downstairs, changing downstairs in the bathroom. My daughter sleeps upstairs with her door closed (her room is adjacent to mine and her door is noisy), and changes in the bathroom or her room, doors closed. Their sleepovers consisted of playing Roblox, or the PS4. He has spent the night at least twice since they were kindergarten together.\n\nHer dad seems to think our daughter is hardly innocent. He asked if we'd had the sex talk, which we have. My daughter and I have also talked about porn as I found Google searches for \"anime porn\" (hentai) on her phone, and the reasons why it is for adults only and the fact that porn can be dangerous (ie the type that makes the news). It was definitely a curve ball, but I trust her answer that she heard about it from school and was curious, though clearly guilty of hiding it. From that discussion she lost her phone for a month. Her dad doesn't know this, and given his penchant in assuming she's a pervert in training, I won't tell him.\n\nI am angry, and sad, and worried that my daughter's dad is either projecting or that he honestly views our 9 year old daughter as a whore. I want her to see his side of the family, but I also want to punch him in the face. I just don't know if her even going over there will be safe, as I know he'll watch her for signs to confirm his belief. I just don't know what to do to show him he's way off base.\n\nWhat CAN I do?\n\nTl;dr My baby daddy thinks our 9 year old is a Jezebel\n\n\n__\n\nEDIT 2 Days later: After our initial meeting, my daughter was upset and stayed in my room for the night because she didn't want to be alone. That was the night I wrote this, with her snoring logs next to me while I let my fears gnaw at me. I think I finally got to sleep after 1 a.m. \n\nThe next day I called into work mid-anxiety attack and kept my daughter home from school so we could have a long talk about what happened the night before. I asked her if she's ever been touched inappropriately by anyone--anyone--and assured her that she could tell me without it making me mad. She said she had not. I spent the later part of the day telling her I love her and doing all that I normally do in making her feel okay about herself, but every so often thinks like, \"Mom, what does 'pervert' mean? What does 'rape' mean?\" would come out and we would talk some more. By the late afternoon we were at Walmart and knowing she's been wanting her hair cut short for the summer, I said screw it, and let her pick out a hairstyle she wanted and watched her locks get snipped away into a pixie. She feels beautiful! She loves it! It's the bright spot in an overall shitty week!\n\nAs for her father, he sent me a long rant through Facebook and continued to disparage our daughter and to fabricate more details on her \"loose\" behavior. I responded in kind and informed him that we're seeking therapy to make sure he hasn't caused lasting damage with his vitriol and HE WILL NO LONGER BE SEEING HER. AGAIN. I'm going to look into having child support stopped, as I don't figure the amount she receives into my budget any way. And if this is all some sick way of washing his hands of responsibility, well, I'd be glad to accept a letter of relinquishment of rights from him.\n\nI know you all don't know me and my daughter, but I just wanted to say thank you for your advice and support. My daughter said she's glad I'm her warrior, but I'm glad there's people out there willing to lend a proverbial ear and shoulder to cry on. \n\n<3",

        "title": "My 15yo sister is pregnant, wants to live with me [x-post from r/legaladvice]",
        "content": "I\u2019ve got a long story. If any of you can stick with me to the end and give information or advice, I would really appreciate it.\n\nI am a 29yo woman who is married and has 1 3yo child. My little sister Sara is 15. We have the same mom, but not the same dad. Her parents never married. The dad is currently paying child support and is deployed in Afghanistan. No one seems to be able to get ahold of him. Sara lives with our mother, who is withdrawn, alcoholic, and manipulative when necessary. She often cons Sara out of her own money (from when she worked part time at a fast food place and from odd jobs here and there). Sara has wanted to come live with me for a long time. I also want her to live with me. Our mom was convinced to allow her to live with me, but her dad was not. He is an authoritarian style parent with major anger issues. He would allow Sara to live with him, but not with me because \u201cshe needs a parent, not a sister.\u201d So for awhile, we planned on having Sara come live with me when she decides to go to college. I live close to a major university, and many smaller ones and community colleges.\n\nNow things have changed. Sara (15) and her boyfriend Hank (17) have become pregnant. She was being safe with birth control and condoms, but it still happened somehow. So things are getting tricky.\n\nHank is worried he will be jailed for statutory rape. I\u2019ve told them that this is not true. That he has to be 18 and there is also a Romeo and Juliet clause that they fall under (within 2 years of age). We live in Texas.\n\nHank, probably out of panic, is attempting to gaslight Sara into thinking that she raped him, that he never consented to sex that one particular time. She explained it all to me (gross) and it sounds like there was consenting activity (him moving her hips, telling her to get in certain positions) and that any non-consent talk was their normal bed talk.\n\nSara has not decided if she wants to keep the child or give it up for adoption. If adoption, she wants an open adoption, but she is leaning toward keeping the child.\n\nI still think that Sara should come live with me, and unfortunately, that means the baby would come, too.\n\nSo now my legal questions:\n\nIf we become legal guardians, does that mean that her parents have to pay us child support? Or does that mean that there is no longer child support in the equation?\n\nIf she keeps the child, would we also be legal guardians of the child? If so, for how long? Until she\u2019s 18? Until she moves out?\n\nWe will want to get child support from Hank, but would he pay her or us? Or nothing at all? I don\u2019t want to take the kid for all he\u2019s worth, but we are on a very tight budget. There\u2019s a reason that my 3yo child doesn\u2019t have a sibling yet. We have been trying to plan our family very carefully. I\u2019m worried that resources meant for our son will go to Sara and her baby instead.\n\nHank is finishing his sophomore year and is planning on getting his GED instead of finishing high school. He plans to continue to study HVAC repair, and he\u2019s currently a pizza delivery driver.  He says that if he tells his parents that he got a girl pregnant, he will be kicked out of his house. But I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true or not.\n\nAlso, Sara is spending the summer with another sister babysitting her kids. She will be done in August. So the first half of her pregnancy will be in a far away town in Bumfuck, (west) TX. I told her to plan her prenatal appointments for when she\u2019ll be back in town.\n\nHer father is in Afghanistan, like I said, and no one can get ahold of him. I feel like he\u2019s going to continue to fight her living with me. If he does this, I can definitely not afford a lawyer to fight him. She\u2019s going to be in a bad position if she\u2019s forced to stay at home, but if she must live with him, idk what that\u2019s going to be like. I actually don\u2019t think that would be too bad, considering what she\u2019s going through with our mom. At least her dad won\u2019t take advantage of her, but he idk\u2026 I\u2019d have to talk to him about this. I mean, she did nothing wrong. She was in a long-term monogamous relationship. She used birth control and condoms. She did everything that a normal healthy safe sexual relationship should be. I can\u2019t say that this is the result of poor upbringing. She did everything right.\n\nI don\u2019t know if all of this is relevant. I\u2019ve just never been in a position like this before. I have no idea what any of this means legally.\n\nP.S. she hasn\u2019t told her parents yet, but I\u2019m trying to convince her to.\n\nP.P.S. This is cross-posted from r/legaladvice. So if you don't want to give legal advice, I would accept any kind of advice. I want to do right by my sister, but I want to do right by my husband and son, too.\n\n**[EDIT] A lot of you have given me really great advice and put things into perspective. I have a lot to think about and to discuss with my family. I will update when more has been settled.**",

You're sure it's not a false positive on the at-home test or possibly an ovarian cyst (which can cause pregnancy symptoms)?\n\n2) What's Sara's plan if she got kicked out of her home and couldn't go to yours? Has she ACTUALLY thought this all the way through as if she had no support? It's an important mental exercise for her to go through because nobody has a crystal ball and whatever plans you make now could go out the window at any time. \n\n3) Are you prepared to sacrifice your marriage for your sister? Yes or no. \n\n4) Are you prepared to sacrifice your plans for a second child for your sister? Yes or no. \n\n5) What about the other sister?

If I woke up he'd tell me that I initiated and he'd get angry and berate me. If it started when I was awake I would say no but he would push until I gave in. At least if I slept downstairs with other people around, I was safe. Not always though, sometimes he carried me to the room while I was passed out drunk...\n\nHe treated me like this regardless of who was around. He would yell at me in front of employees, and he treated them like shit as well. Once he threatened to hit me in front of them.\n\nHe never did hit me, but once he had me on the ground with his hand around my neck until a friend pulled him off.\n\nWe ended up living separately but one day went to a theme park with our daughter and two friends. At the hotel that night he tried to have sex with me while I was asleep, but our friends in the room confronted him. I had no idea why he was so upset the next morning until they told me. I don't doubt it was true, he'd done it a hundred times before. No one ever believed me until that day. I had tried to tell people.\n\nSo they convinced me to go to the police and report him. I didn't press charges because I didn't want to \"ruin his life\". I was so stupid. But I didn't want to drag myself and my daughter into a case like that. I filed for divorce that day, and a restraining order. The first thing he did after receiving the order was come down to work and get in my face, threatening me. I called the cops and they removed him and the guns from his house. I didn't notify him of the restraining order ahead of time like I was supposed to because I was afraid he would kill me. I literally wrote that on the paperwork where it asks why you did not notify, if applicable.\n\nWe've since been divorced, and he hasn't bothered to see our daughter except maybe 3 times. They skype occasionally. I try not to let my history with him affect her relationship with him. I figure she'll learn he's full of excuses all the time and get sick of it when she's old enough to realize.\n\nBut now to the present. Recently a friend sent me a news link about him. It's in the paper from a month ago. He was accused of raping 4 women from his recovery program (drugs). More, but they haven't officially come forward. Apparently he offered them a safe place to stay while recovering and an impressive story of sobriety. He always had big impressive stories when I knew him that seemed too hyperbolic.\n\nHe's always been manipulative and had excuses for everything. Every time he calls there's something huge going on in his life that causes him to be unable to see his daughter or send money. He's a big talker.\n\nI guess he was acquitted of all charges. But I really believe he did this. I have no doubts that he did it. He did it to me for years.\n\nWhat do I do? I don't think he would ever hurt our daughter. He's not a pedophile. But I don't want her around him. He's of bad character, and I don't want her to grow up and find a man like him. I don't want her to look up to this sorry excuse for a human being. Am I right in cutting him off? I feel responsible, like if I had done something back then that maybe I could have saved all these women. I feel like this is my fault. Maybe they got scared and recanted. I don't know what to do except try to shelter my daughter from him.\n\nShe spends summers with his mother (in another state, while he lives in our state), who is absolutely wonderful, but she knew and did not tell me. She was here a few weeks ago for court and didn't tell me that was why she was here. But she's done so much good for my daughter that I don't think cutting her out is in the best interest of my daughter.\n\nPlease help me.\n\nTL;DR: Ex-husband used to rape me and has been accused of raping at least 4 (they think more) women in his recovery program, he was acquitted. I still think he did it because of our history. I want to cut him off from seeing daughter, but I don't think he's a pedophile or would hurt her. His mother, who she spends summers with and is wonderful, believes he is innocent. I just want to do what's best for her. If I do, he will try to convince me that I'm being crazy.\n\nEdit: Also, what do I tell my daughter?\n\nEdit 2: I've since spoken with the leader of the sobriety group. Apparently they are roommates now and he does not think my ex did it. He says that some guy was angry with my ex and coerced the women. I don't know if I believe this. But he lets my ex watch his children and doesn't think he did it.",

I have been trying to rally, but it has been rough.\n\nThis morning, my husband planned to drop me off at the walk on because my shoulder has been killing me, pick up our older daughter at preschool and then I would watch our youngest while he took our oldest for an xray she needed.\n\nAs we pulled into parking lot I see a baby bunny being attacked by birds. I tell my husband to pull over. He says he will park and take care of it. My youngest and I sit.im the car and wait. A few minutes later my husband comes back with a bunny. He chased the birds away, but the bunny's nest was nowhere in sight and s/he was startled. We decide it needs our help. Now, it was adorable and I wanted to keep it, but I know it is a wold animal that needs to be free. I hold it and we call my mother in law eho has a friend that runs a bunny rescue. She couldn't take our bunnies because she isn't licensed for wild bunnies, but she gave us a number of someone who could. While my oldest is getting her xray I am in the car with my youngest and the bunny (now in a nice, warm box) making arrangements with the rescue. \n\nWe drove almost an hour out of the way and met a nice woman who rehabilitates and releases bunnies. Our little bunny was 2-2.5 weeks old and would likely nit have survived without help. S/he is safe and on special formula. S/he (too young to tell sex) is doing well. We will be getting pictures and updates and the bunny will be released in a 300 acre no hunting area. \n\nIt was a good chance to teach our kids about helping. We also explained while we wanted to keep the bunny we had to do what was best for the bunny. We explained wild animals belong outside. Sometimes they need help, but then they have to go back home to the wild. They were so excited to help.\n\nI don't know if it was helping the cutie pie or tje fact my husband took such care when he didn't have to, but it was what I needed. It helped me feel good. I finally got my shoulder looked at (no relief, but hopefully it will feel better after a round of steriods). We had swim class and now I get to cuddle my kitties. It was a great day.",

        "content": "When I was 17, I was introduced to the world of sex and drugs. I was young and dumb and was having sex with every Thom, Dick, and Harry that would show me the least bit of attention. I'm really thankful I didn't mess up my body any more than it already is. When I as 18, I got introduced to a man who loved drugs too. Probably more than me. The honey moon period was great. We were inseparable, spending every waking second together either getting high or having sex. And then it happened. I was dumb, didn't make him wear a condom and I ended up pregnant. MY first thought was to get rid of the pregnancy. I was barely 18, I wasnt even sure if I wanted kids. But no no no he begged and begged for me to keep his child. He promised to love and support us and take care of us.  I gave in and decided to keep the child. I quit using drugs, and asked my boyfriend to as well, and he said he would try.\n\nBut he didnt. He cared more about the drugs than me or his kid. After the shock, I was actually excited. I thought I would have my own little family to look after and take care of. I got sober, I got a job while pregnant that had really good benefits after I was done with the probation period. I was supporting us while he continued to get worse. There would be days when he would call me at work, leaving the worse voice mails. Screaming at me how I was worthless and useless. But when he needed his next fix, I was the first person he came to when he was broke. He would abandon me for days sometimes without speaking a single word to me. He spent every cent he had and then some on getting his next fix.  I don't know why I thought he would change for our kid. \n\nWhen I went into labor, he moaned and complained about having to drive me to the hospital because he had a headache. Not even 24 HRS after I had given birth to our daughter, he was asking me for a hand job in the hospital room because he felt \"neglected\". He refused to hold our daughter and didnt sign her birth certificate either because he \"didn't want to be on the hook for child support\" if we ever split up. But when it was time for me to go back to work, he refused to let me take our daughter to the daycare my job provided. I stupidly thought he was turning around for the better and wanted to actually be a stay at home parent and take care of our daughter. and again I was wrong\n\nI'd come home to find my daughter hungry or sitting in her dirty diaper for hours while her dad would sleep or just leave her by herself. Every time I would confront him he would get angry and accuse me of accusing him of being a bad parent. He would bust holes in walls and doors and say things like \"aren't you glaf I hit the wall instead of you or the baby?\" \n\nI got tired of it. I couldnt take it any more. It wasn't about me any more. I have a baby I need to take care of and look out for. The final straw was when he threw a glass plate at my head while I was holding our daughter. He screamed at me to \"shut her the fuck up\" because he was going through withdrawls. enough was enough.  I didnt feel safe any more. I broke my lease and went to work the next day with my daughter and told my boss every thing\n\nMy boss is an awesome lady who gave me the number to a shelter. They have a waiting list as long as my arm but i stressed to her how I couldnt go back to him. She was awesome enough to give me some money so me and my daughter could stay in a hotel until the shelter had a place open for us. They have both mine and my boss's number so muy fingers are crossed that I will get a call soon \n\nThat was last Wednesday. he started harassing me on Thursday when he realized I wasnt coming home and he realized his drug money had been cut off. I blocked his number, got rid of my facebook so he couldnt harass me on there either. Ive spent a lot of nights crying and feeling guilty \n\nI miss him. And I wish I didn't. I feel angry at myself for leaving because I keep wanting to tell myself he'll change. I'm sad for my daughter whos father cares more about drugs than her. I'm sad for him because I want him to get help but I dont know if he ever will. I'm scared for the future when my daughter grows up and asks me about her dad and I wont know what to say\n\nI struggled with this for weeks before I finally left. and now that I have I just feel sad.  I dont feel great that I left. I feel scared and alone. I'm thankful I have an awesome boss and coworkers who are looking for for us. I didn't think I'd be a single mom at 19 but I can be so thankful that I got out before it got worsr\n\nI dont know what to expect for the future but it can't be much worse than the shit I put myself through for going on 2 years. My daughter deserves much better \n\nI just wanted to get this off my chest and share my story.

        "content": "Fast backstory: We took in a teenage girl who was in a sexually abusive home with the idea that besides providing her a safe shelter where she could focus on school and work we could teach her basic things people should know that her parents decided weren't important in her upbringing such as taxes, budgeting, the sex talk, etc.\n\nFast forward to now, approximately 4 months after she moved in and she snap chatted my wife telling her she is getting a  puppy. We kindly reminded her our landlord is so strict about no pets that they're not even allowed outside on the property. She then dropped a bombshell on us stating that she was going to move in with her boyfriend so she could get this puppy because if she didn't someone else would and she had to have it.\n\nThe only thing going through my mind right now is, where did we go wrong. She's not biologically our child and she's old enough to leave whenever she wants but she's not getting the logic that if she can't even save her money now how is she suppose to take care of an animal let alone rent, utilities, bills etc? I can't seem to get through to her and I'm being as straight forward and civil as I can but her lack of understanding has me screaming inside of my head.\n\nHow can I get through to her that she's not ready to move out, she's not responsible enough to get herself up for school without help (proven by her staying with us), she has no grasp of what budgeting or bills are like and hasn't much desire to learn about them she just wants freedom even though we've given her so much freedom to be herself.\n\nI don't know what to do or what to think. I lost my job recently and was my families only source of income and now I'm going to be worrying about a teenager who after everything we went through for her is going to leave because she wants a puppy.... I don't even know what to think right now or how to get through to her. I don't know what else I can do to stop her from making a terrible mistake.",

This is what is happening, it isn't a failure on your part.  It is the reality that right now to her the emotional components of a situation make it hard to see the logic.\n\nWhat I would do?  Probably try to recognize where she is coming from.  To her she probably REALLY wants this puppy and knows she will just be devastated if she just doesn't have it.  Maybe try appealing to her emotions \"We would really miss you if you were gone and would like you to reconsider. Can you boyfriend take care of the puppy and you visit often?\"  Maybe encourage her to volunteer at an animal shelter",

        "content": "I tried posting to relationships, but I basically got reamed. I guess in ways I don't blame them but I really do want to make things better with my kid. I'm going to try to stick to just the bare facts because according to everyone in the relationships forum, it doesn't really matter why I did what I did.\n\nMy daughter wasn't planned. My ex, Molly, became pregnant with Savannah the first time we had sex. And then I married Molly because I thought it was the best thing to do. Her having Savannah was the happiest day of my life. I can't describe how I felt holding her, spending time with her, making her smile and laugh. She was the light of my world.\n\nMolly suffered from terrible PPD. She could barely get out of bed. I worked 60+ hour weeks and took care of her and Savannah with every free moment. Once Molly went back to work things stabilized but our relationship didn't recover. We divorced when Savannah was 5.\n\nI gave Molly our car, our condo, and primary custody. I thought it would give Savannah the best environment. Our visitation agreement that I'd have Savannah two nights a week and every other weekend. I never missed a day. She was my little pudding pop and the highlight of my week. I helped with homework, did crafts with her, started teaching her how to cook and letting her help me in the kitchen (age-appropriately - helping me wash vegetables, handing me ingredients, stirring things). I put extra money forward every month toward child support.\n\nWhen Savannah was 8, almost 9, I lost my job and apartment. I was homeless for a while. I moved in with an alcoholic friend and his chain-smoking family where all I had was my clothes, a few books, and a mattress in a concrete basement storage space. \n\nI called Molly and let her know what happened. That I didn't have a safe space to host Savannah. That I wouldn't have money for child support for a while. Molly said I'd have to figure something out. She didn't want me to visit at her house. I wasn't sure how reliable my schedule or income would be and I didn't know how setting up a neutral location would go. That's not an excuse, but at the time I was reeling from having my world crash down. Molly and I agreed I should try to get stable because I didn't want instability in Savannah's life. \n\nBut one month turned to three, six, nine. I couldn't find stable work. Any time I had an odd job I'd put a bit of money toward support but it wasn't enough. I felt anxious and ashamed, and afraid to face my daughter and ex. I didn't set up an alternative arrangement, I just went without seeing them.\n\nAfter two years I couldn't live there anymore. I moved in with an elderly neighbor as a caretaker, working 16 hours 6 days a week in exchange for just a bedroom. But it was better than nothing, and safer than my friend's house. I contacted Molly and asked about seeing Savannah. She said Savannah was working through my absence and that her counselor didn't think it was appropriate for me to see her at that time. That I would have to wait until the therapist okayed it.\n\nThis is where I screwed up again. I figured Molly would contact me when/if Savannah was ready. So I didn't follow up. I waited. And I never heard anything. And instead of checking in I continued to wait. Because I'm an a**hole and an idiot.\n\nSix months ago I had a heart attack. My girlfriend decided I couldn't go back to living how I was. She took me in. Since then I've started feeling human again. Started feeling like I'm coming back to life. My health is better. I have a safe loving home. I even found a job recently. And after I got my offer letter I contacted Molly and asked how Savannah was doing and if I could potentially see her or talk to her. \n\nMolly told me Savannah doesn't want anything to do with me. That she wants to know why now. I explained that I finally am stable. Molly said she'll believe it when she sees it and that she's married now and Savannah is calling her husband dad. Ouch [especially because I know she's been with this guy 7 months, they got engaged in July, and married in August]. She doubled down by saying that, given how I felt about my dad (who disappeared when my mom was pregnant and no one has heard from since), how could I expect Savannah to feel any different. I told her that if I'd known my dad at some point or if he'd bothered to find me I'd at least have given him a chance. Pointless response, I know. I was feeling hurt and defensive. \n\nI haven't heard anything since.\n\nI know I screwed up beyond imagination. I know there is no excuse for dropping out of my daughters life, no matter the circumstance. I let my fear and shame get in the way of my love and I was afraid to own the fact that I was being a bad dad, so I avoided it. \n\nBut I want to do better. She deserves better from me. And there has not been a single day that I haven't thought about her and about getting to the point where she could be proud to have me as a dad again. And now I'm facing the abyss because I may have lost her forever.\n\nPayments are going toward child support (plus extra). That's all I can do right now, be financial support and try to show that there is stability in my life. \n\nBut I don't know what else I can do. What the next steps are. If this is even salvageable.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nEdit: Savannah just turned 13. It's been 4 years since I saw her.",

Legally your ex has no right to withhold visitation that has been set down in a custody agreement, whether you are current in support or not. \n\nFrom the details in your post I'm guessing that Savannah is 12-13 now? A lot of growth and change happens during that time. She likely has a lot of feeling surrounding you and why you left her. It's also extremely likely that the only emotion she's going to portray is anger/ indifference. Don't let her outward display of anger discourage you. It is far, far easier to be angry than it is to be hurt and vulnerable.\n\nI hope that you are able to mend things with your daughter. No matter what your ex says, your daughter gets the final say about having you in her life.

        "content": "Ok, firstly please forgive me if this isn't formatted correctly, I am writing this up on my phone on the app. \n\nI really need help, information.\n\nI have been going out with my partner now for just over a year, she has a wonderful 6 year old son who I use to get along with really well. She's been separated from her ex (her sons father) for 5 years and had split custody, week on, week off. During this time the father has caused issues, only wanted to see his son when it suited him. Stole from my partner, owes her over 2k cash that we have on record of him saying he will pay back (this is in things like my partner covering his early child care and kindi costs mostly, with a bunch of other things tallying up.) \n\nI knew I wanted to marry my partner very early into our relationship, I knew that I wanted to be part of her and her sons lives so I asked to meet the father of her son, I mean if my child was going to be living with someone I'd want to make sure they were going to be safe and such. Since that day, he has treated me like shit, started being incredibly controlling and using our son as a weapon... I honestly don't know what to do, it's not only putting a massive strain on our relationship, but also pushing me away from our son. My partner doesn't drive, we now also have a 4 month old baby girl, so I tend to do a lot of the driving around and dropping the kid off and picking him up, our baby is also been incredibly taxing with early teething, reflux and night/day confusion so my partner needs all the sleep she can get. \n\nI'm just going to go ahead and list some of the shit her ex has pulled recently. We moved our son from his old school to a new school, at his old school he was getting bullied and was struggling to learn on top of having no friends, the move to the new school also meant that he no longer had to sit for an hour and a half before school and after school in their care facility because it is close enough to walk to school with him instead of having to cross auckland in the morning traffic to get him to school and get to work on the other side through traffic. He loves his new school, how reading level increased, he has friends that he visits after school and he's all round happier... Till he came back from his father's and told us he didn't want to go to school there, he doesn't like it and he has no friends and he wants to go to a school his father has been talking up (which is a terrible school) so that was a fun week or two getting him re adjusted to his school and getting him happy again to be going. \n\nHe's also been telling our son to not listen to me, calling me stupid and completely undermining my authority which almost led to our son being hit by a fucking car... I was getting work done on my car at a rather busy panel beaters and cars are going up and down the driveway constantly, he keeps running around and I ask him to stop because it's very dangerous and I may need to put him in the car if he doesn't to which he replied \"my daddy says I don't have to listen to you!\" and runs out around the corner and I just manage to grab his hood in time to stop him being run over, this was the scariest time I have ever had, I was trembling with both fear and anger at what happened and what I just heard. \n\nOntop of all this his latest action has set me over, the proverbial straw... I was sitting in my car parked in his driveway while I wait for my partner to fetch our son, normal Sunday pick up. I'm respectful, I know he doesn't like me so I stay in the car and am just a glorified chauffeur... As I wait in my car his flatmate walks past the car and drops something throw the window, I was like \"hey man what's this?\"  and all I got was a laugh and a \" Fuck you\"  so I open the folded piece of paper to reveal that I have now got a trespass notice against me for his house... I go up to the front door to question if it was real or some kind of sick joke, before I even get to the door he's on the phone to the cops, accusing me of threatening him, accusing me of having weapons so I back away, I'm shocked but trying to stay calm his flatmate is filming the whole thing, leans in an keeps whispering shit to me, trying to get me bit, accusing me of having sex in front of our son and a few worse things and at this stage I'm done I'm actually about to lose my shit and go to jail so I leave I go stand next to the car and wait for the police to arrive the whole time my partner is in tears and our son is confused asking what's going on and why the cops are trying to arrest me.....  \n\nAlso, he's a fucking terrible father, our son goes over there and only gets McDs for dinner, no breakfast unless he, a 6 year old makes it himself because his father is either sleeping till mid day or passed out, he doesn't get showers and his bed is covered in piss and hasn't been washed for over a year. There is rather shit through his draws and we ask constantly for him to clean it for our sons health nothing. \n\nI'm sorry this turned into a Bitch fest, a massive whine and vent but it's actually starting to break me and I need advice as to what to do. I feel like I do everything for his son and yet I get treated like shit made to feel horrible and like the villain. \n\nWe currently have her son Monday to Friday and the father has him Saturday morning and returns him after school on monday. This was changed from week on week off because that was a huge part of the reason the kid wasn't learning, he had no routine at his father's, no home work, no revision. He would go home watch cartoons in his room and eat junk food - (part of the reason) \n\nHe does a lot of drugs and is very unstable, doesn't work and lives off his winz cheques, he doesn't pay child support because he's not working, he doesn't contribute at all towards anything the kid needs. But constantly shits all over me, I'm not allowed to bring his son to him so now we have to go completely put of our way to drop him off, which sure it's not a big deal but it kind of is when you get treated like shit. \n\nThere is so so much more manipulation and mental anguish he's causing our son but I've already wasted a lot of your time.. \n\nThanks for reading. \n\nHelp.",

        "content": "Okay, this is going to be long \u2013 but I desperately need advice, I don\u2019t know what to do and feel sick with worry. \n\nThe relevant background...\n\nMy god-daughters are 17 (just turned, a couple of days ago), 14 and 11. My SO and I have been financially and emotionally responsible for them for years \u2013 we\u2019ve paid their parents bills, we buy their school uniform, we put food in their bellies. Things are bad at home. Really bad \u2013 and recently got worse, to the extent that we can no longer contain the negative environment form affecting the girls. The eldest called social services (the UK version of CPS), they have intervened, things got worse \u2013 she was threatened by her step father and moved in with us. This was almost 8 months ago.\n\nThe situation at home \u2013 an emotionally and physically absent father (though he lives in the same house, in his own room, surrounded by his games consoles) \u2013 he doesn\u2019t contribute to the family unit. Lack of food, the girls go hungry often. They don\u2019t bathe, clean themselves or brush their teeth. There is a significant lack of appropriate supervision (the 11 year old will be out at 11pm at night, by herself, half way across town). The conditions of the house are disgusting \u2013 cat urine soaked floors and beds, mold on walls, feces on the carpet. Neither mum nor dad appear to have the mental capacity to recognise that the situation is bad, and have constantly minimised matters (social services have observed this).\n\nThis is a massive ongoing case with social services, my SO and I, in addition to having the 17YO living with us, have the younger two for two nights a week. It supposed to be so that mum (dad does nothing) can tackle things at home, in reality, she goes out drinking. It\u2019s important to note, we receive no support (financial or otherwise) from any government agency or the girls parents We are simply expected to help, and we feel forced (though, even without the pressure, we would still do so because we love the kids) to continue to help for fear of what us stepping back would cause. \n\nI love the 17YO with all my heart. We are close, more like sisters, but she respects my parental authority. She will do as told. But, lets be honest, calling social services on your own mum and dad, being threated, moving out, having your parents quite literally ignore you for months on end, will mess you up a little. I have battled for months to get her therapy \u2013 this has only just started. She has swung from wanting to stay in, being depressed, to wanting to be out of our house 24/7. Well, not quite 24/7, we have rules \u2013 she has a curfew (which she has never missed), and we have expectations about how much time she spends having family time. She enjoys spending time with us and my SO and I work hard to give her a family environment, but we're just learning ourselves.\n\nTHE ISSUE!\n\nShe has an unhealthy attitude towards relationships. I would imagine this stems from the absence of a suitable male figure in her life \u2013 her dad has been worse than absent, he has been there every day of her life, but shut away in his own room by his own admission \u201cnot caring about how the girls are raised, it\u2019s not my job\u201d. She seeks male approval \u2013 she has relationships with boys that are just, bad. She\u2019s 17, it\u2019s legal for her to have sex and I know she has sex with boys she's in 'relationships' with, we\u2019ve made sure she\u2019s safe and we\u2019ve had three million conversations about emotional and physical responsibility. But still, it\u2019s like she\u2019s a moth to a flame \u2013 she is immediately attracted to any guys who pay her attention, and half of them I swear smell vulnerability. You know when you meet someone and something is just off? \n\nI\u2019ve just (about an hour ago) found out she\u2019s dating and I suspect sleeping with an almost 23 year old. He has a child with another woman. He is SIX years old her than her, almost seven. Six bloody years. Am I being too judgey to be repulsed by this? He is an adult. He is two years younger than me. I\u2019m utterly disgusted that he would date someone I consider to still be a child, and a child who is massively emotionally damaged. \n\nShe\u2019s lied about him to both my SO and I \u2013 and lied about where she has been going and who with. She\u2019s removed status\u2019 he\u2019s tagged her in from her facebook so we don\u2019t see. I found out by sort of facebook stalking him after having a bad feeling when I briefly oversaw a conversation between them on her iPad \u2013 she shut it down and moved it form sight as soon as she noticed that I\u2019d seen it.\n\nOh my gosh guys. I know this is long \u2013 but I don\u2019t know what to do. I know teenagers lie, I knew this would happen, but I feel so hurt. What do I do? How do I protect her? I\u2019m barely 26 years old. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing here and we are getting no support or guidance, I can't even turn to the woman who raised her, because she is useless and has encouraged 17YO to get pregnant ASAP so she can get her own house (we have her on track to go to university next year, she's working hard, we're on her back and keeping the goal in sight). \n\nI don\u2019t know how to keep her safe if she's not truthful with me and I\u2019m scared that she\u2019s making a massive mistake here. I think I'm just starting to realise how painful it is to watch your kids make mistakes that you can't prevent. \n\nPlease help! How do I approach this with her? I'm really really concerned that she'll immediately shut down about it and I just don't know how to reach her if she's actively lying to us.

        "most_upvoted_comment": "Suggestion: don't try to stop her from seeing him.

She should be able to agree with generalities like that.) Ask to meet him and encourage her to have \"dates\" in your home or out with the family sometimes. Be friendly. If he doesn't want to come, that's a warning sign. If he does and seems off, you'll at least have more info.\n\nTalk to her about healthy relationships.

I miss being intimate with my wife, our relationship and marriage is strong, but that one component is missing and we're still seeing a therapist once a month to help, but it has honestly been over a year since we last had sex. I also don't \"clean the pipes\" as often as I should and in the last 6 months, I've been having wet dreams every few weeks.

This is a result of her always listening to her gut feeling, and not to what other people tell her, which we are proud of her for doing, but it makes parenting harder sometimes. She won't do what we tell her either. Whenever she wants something she isn't allowed her attitude has always been to do it secretly.

Without thinking he can say things as \"I hope you find a good man to take care of you\" to our daughter. This is well-intended but she will roll her eyes and say she can take care of herself.

One time she was listening to a rap song and my husband heard the word \"rape\" in it and asked her if she knew what it meant. My daughter rolled her eyes and said \"no\". My husband didn't realize she was being sarcastic and so he keeps thinking she is very innocent.\n\nShe is not. When we picked her up from a party a while back we were driving one of her friends home as well. In the car the friend told us that our daughter and her had both made-out with a boy (not the same boy) at the party. I could see my daughter was angry with her for telling this, and tried to change the conversation, but my husband and I asked her more, since our daughter never tells us anything. There wasn't really anything else to be found out though. \n\nWhat's more is we gave our daughter and old laptop to use. She does a lot of drawing on it and has started making electronic music. However, I got suspicious becuse she'd start locking herself in with the laptop and not open the door. One time I heard noises that definitely sounded like porn so I asked her if she has watched porn and she declined. I didn't believe her and said I want to check her computer. She refused and when I tried to take it from her she ran outside and smashed it on a rock, then threw it into the sea. Afterwards she was angry at me, saying it was my fault she had to break her computer and lost all her drawings and pics and music on it. Regarding the pics, I once caught her taking naked pics of herself in her room and I suspect she put those on her computer and deleted them from phone (she shows me her phone pics and knows she couldn't have naked pics on it). And regarding her drawings, they portray young women with huge breasts, skinny waists, dressed in revealing, often military style clothing, and they have heavy make-up, often piercings, and they are often smoking and drinking. These aren't the drawings she will show us, but I have seen them in her notebook she keeps in her desk drawer.\n\nWe gave her a new old laptop after she broke the other one and now she has re-installed a new OS (Linux) making herself administrator so we can't access anything even if we try. She also only uses her laptop in the bathroom or her room so she can lock the door. She says that's because we are stronger than her and could take it when she's logged in otherwise. My husband told her we can take it to his job and he can ask the computer expert there to access her stuff. She said her stuff is encrypted and safe. We feel this situation is very unfortunate because we used to enjoy her sitting with us while she drew on her laptop. It was family time, but now she locks herself in her room. If we threaten to take her laptop if she doesn't let us look through it, she is ready to give it up, so that doesn't work.\n\nAnd what's even more is that we have found half a condom wrapper under her bed. When confronted about it she claims she knows nothing about it and has no idea how it ended up there. We obviously don't believe this. Another time when she was playing with her friend (boy, 11) in her room I heard grunting and went inside and found them dry-humping in her bed. I asked her what was going on and she claims they were \"playing family\" and the mom and dad were \"making a baby\". She wants me to believe it was just innocent game, and I told my husband, and he believes it. Another time another friend was sleeping over and as usual we put his (I forgot to mention she is a hardcore tomboy and has mostly male friends) mattress on the floor next to her bed. However, in the morning I found them both in her bed. Her explanation \"We were cold and freezing\".\n\nI think that's about all she's done at this point. I have tried talking about her but it's like talking to a wall. \"I don't need to discuss this with you mom\", \"It is private\", \"I don't beed to answer honestly when you ask questions about none of your business\", etc. And my husband thinks she is just a little kid. I tried giving her some sex ed too because she hasn't had any in school but she will reply \"Mom, I already know all this stuff.\" and when I ask how she knows she says the internet. \n\nAny ideas what I should do about this, if anything?",

First - she isn't sure  how  to limit  her daughter's  internet access because  her daughter  has worked  out  how to access  the neighbour's  wifi. She completely ignores the fact the  advice of not allowing  her daughter  unsupervised  access  with technology  at all. The main argument here is technology is a powerful tool  - and like other  tools like  ovens, power drills etc- children  need full  supervision  until they  prove they  can use it correctly. Its proof first  trust later.\n\n\nSecond - she is also in denial that her daughter  is going through  puberty because  - and to be crass - she doesn't  have boobs yet. She doesn't  seem to  understand  that puberty  isn't  just physical changes - its emotional and hormonal. \n\n**OP you are  the parent  here**  Yes you need to monitor  her technology  usage - yes  you need  to set  boundaries  and have firm discussions  with  her.

        "content": "I have a 15 yo daughter who has signed up to perform in her high school's talent show with a song she has written. The song is written for her boyfriend and there is one sentence which vaguely and subtlety references sex. Think of the song Hallelujah and the sentence \"But remember when I moved in you and the holy dove was moving too.\" That's about how subtle it is. When she sang it to some family my 10 yo son sort of picked it up and asked her what that sentence meant and she said it is a reference to sex. She wasn't the least fazed with the question. I talked to her about what if the school starts talking about what you mean with that sentence and she replied she'd be flattered that they actually bothered to listen to the lyrics. She's very comfortable and confident in herself, especially for her age. She said the boyfriend doesn't mind her singing that either.\n\nThe song is sort of slow, same mood as the Hallelujah song too. She is going to sit and play the piano and sing. She has already picked a nice 'conservative' outfit (blouse and black dress pants) for the performance. There is absolutely nothing explicit or otherwise 'mature' about the song, so I suppose the general impression of the performance might weigh up for that one sentence. Still, the thought of my daughter basically confessing to the entire school that she is having sex with her boyfriend makes me a little uneasy. Perhaps I am old-fashioned and kids these days won't really care. Perhaps they won't even notice that sentence or think much of it. On the other hand, she has about 5 older songs she has written that are perfectly \"safe\" and she could pick any of those instead. She said she wants to sing her new song because it is new and her best so far (I agree, the new one is better than the older ones). She also won't change the sentence because she thinks that would take away from the song. I have to admit that the sentence fits into the rest of the song. It doesn't pop out or anything. \n\nI want some advice on this. Am I being ridiculous? I wouldn't mind at all if she was actually singing the song Hallelujah because then the sex reference wouldn't be to herself but to the song writer of that song. I only mind because this song is obviously her own experience (in case that wasn't clear). \n\nThanks!",

        "content": "In the course of my days working with high school students, I have found that many parents say things to their children that can never be unsaid. Much like squeezing all the toothpaste from a tube and then trying to put it back in, the spoken word is pretty hard to take back. Through the years I\u2019ve heard some of the following things from students:\n\n-She says I\u2019m horrible and selfish, just like my grandma.\n-They tell me I\u2019m stupid all the time.\n-He told me I\u2019ll never be any good at anything.\n-They always tell me to shut up.\n-I try to be honest, but they always get mad.\n-I want to talk to my mom, but she says she\u2019s my mom not my friend.\n-Mom says I\u2019m a slut because I had sex.\n-Any time I tell them what I think they call me a bitch.\n-There\u2019s a lot of screaming in our house. I hate it.\n-He says I\u2019m a sissy because I\u2019m not enough of a man and I like dressing nice.\n-Dad says women are damn fools.\n-She always calls me lazy. I hate it.\n\nWhile these examples are extreme (though common), other ways of speaking are less pointed but no less hurtful. Our fears for our kids make us just a bit...controlling.\n\nWe try to \u201cfix\u201d our children or we don\u2019t like their new opinions and try to change their minds. We dismiss their passion because they are young or we try to manipulate them by reminding them how much we\u2019ve done for them. When we do these things, we are using words as weapons and declaring our children to be our enemies. But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way.\n\nDo you really want to manipulate someone you love? To destroy this torrent of debilitating words you must turn off the faucet. Stop Talking. Stop Responding. Just STOP. It\u2019s time to practice a new way of doing things.\n\nLet your son or daughter speak. Stop what you are doing and look at them while they talk. Breathe. Use your eyes to convey that they are loved. Smile and nod if you need to. That\u2019s it. \n\nUSE NO WORDS unless it would be rude to do otherwise. Silence and loving eyes will generally convey more than your words, especially if you have broken trust in the past by being disrespectful or mean-spirited.\n\nIf this feels strange, chances are that you NEED to do this. If your child is not currently speaking much to you, tell them that you have blown it and that you are working on becoming a safe person for them to talk to. Tell them you might not be perfect at it, but you are going to really try. Yes \u2013 apologize to them. Tell them you\u2019ve been wrong. It will be both the hardest and one of the most fulfilling gestures you will ever make.",

We haven't found out the sex (because surprises are awesome). \n\nWe have a girl (3) already. If it's another girl this time, we have chosen a name that we both love and that goes well with our first daughter's name. It's a slightly unconventional name in the UK but not unheard of by any means. It's a Latin word, a popular name in Spain/Italy and a character we both admire in the Harry Potter books.\n\nThen I went and Googled that name combined with our surname. \n\nAnd I found there are a bunch of adult videos featuring a young lady who goes by that name.\n\nIt's not the first result on Google, but it's on the first page.

        "title": "Neighbor called DCFS on my husband and I and said my husband was a sex offender, among other things!",
        "content": "I am gonna double post this here in an r/legaladvice.\n\nSo we live in a very small town, population is about 2,500. It's a very quiet small country town in Indiana. It's the kind of place where neighbors wave to each other when walking down the street, and you can feel safe leaving your doors unlocked. We bought our house in 2012 right before my daughter's first birthday. It was a foreclose and had some issues. Mind you we only paid 16k for a 2300 sq ft house on a 1/4 acre lot. For my husband's work it's perfect, we are an hour away from 3 major cities. We are also an hour away from my family.\nMy husband and I keep to ourselves pretty much. Try not to cause any problems as we just want a pretty peaceful life and raise our kids in a quiet place.  By the way my kids are 3 and 4.\n\nSo about a week and half ago close to the end of our nap time we get a knock on the door, which is unusual for us. I open the door and was informed the gentleman was from DCFS and that they had received a call and they needed to check up on us. Now you can imagine I am a bit baffled by why DCFS could be here. My daughter had just went to the doctor earlier in the day, but it's not like there was anything that would cause alert. While I waited on my husband to come outside I asked him what the call was about. \n(Now we know it was a neighbor from things that was stated, especially about the broken window)\n\nHe said it was several things, starting with my husband had been arrested on sex crimes (meaning he is a sex offender). Now, if he was a registered sex offender we wouldn't be living in this house as it is 1000ft from a school, library, and daycare!\n\nNext, it was that I allow my children to swim in the backyard unattended. When my children swim I am not right up on them, but sitting right in our back laundry room out of the sun. Unless you were in my backyard you would not be able to see me. I was also told that the person had stated he had pictures showing my children swimming unattended. \nNext was that we were burning pallet wood(during wintertime) in a fireplace that the original owner had said should never be used. However, in the last 2 years we have had it inspected and was told we could use it. Some of the very top bricks are broken slightly but that it would keep us from using it as the smoke was going out at the top and not back into the house. \nHe also stated that there was a leaky roof. \nBut the big thing was the fact that several weeks earlier this huge outside window had just magically came unglued (previous owners glued/painted all the windows shut) and fell to the ground. So this huge outside window broke, in which I had no idea. The male neighbor came over and told me the window had fallen and broken. I thanked him for telling me and shut my door. I guess because I didn't overreact and rush out the door he felt that I was too emotionless, or at least that is what he said in his report\n.I never paid attention to the fact that a smaller pane had also broken until I caught my son throwing things out the window. Once I did I covered it up with cardboard, but my son keeps removing it and tossing his sister's baby dolls out the window. I am guessing this is the reason why he called, he felt that we hadn't taken action quick enough.We have the glass to replace it with, but then my husband became seriously ill with lower GI issues and had to go to the hospital.\n\nSo here are my issues:\n1) My husband is not a sex offender, why on earth someone would lie about that is beyond me.\n2)This man is taking pictures of my children in swimsuits without my knowledge/permission in the privacy of my own backyard. Taking these kind of pictures is illegal in Indiana, and could land him as a register sex offender. I am debating alerting the police to this fact.\nNot to mention you see children swimming unattended and your first reaction is to take pictures? Seriously, I would go knock on my neighbors door or call the police.\n3)As far as the chimney and roof are concerned how would he know if we made repairs or not, especially if he hasn't asked us.\nMy husband is in the process of writing a long letter to the neighbor explaining how the roof was been patched, how the chimney had been checked before use. How we have a camera outside facing in the general area of where the children are  playing so if he has to be at his office computer(he works from home but is very flexible) and I am not home he can see the children playing (no pool). And that is another thing, the pool hadn't been out for over a month and half.\n\nTL:DR Next door neighbor called DCFS claiming I let my kids swim unattended, my husband is a sex offender, we are using a fireplace that the previous owners said that should never be used (even though we had it checked out) that there is a huge hole in our roof, and about a broken window(this is the only legit claim).\nThis is sorta a vent as well as seeking advice. Would you let it go or would you pursue it? This man is taking pictures of my children or has in the past. Telling people my husband is a sex offender and basically claiming I assume we are bad parents because I let my child play in our fenced in back yard and might leave them alone for a few moments(again not when the pool is inflated) while I do dishes or mop the living room/kitchen, prepare lunch or dinner, and can still see them from inside the house. He had one legit complaint but instead of coming to us, he tries to get us in trouble with DCFS.\nMy husband is in the process of writing a long letter to the neighbor explaining how the roof was been patched, how the chimney had been checked before use. How we have a camera outside facing in the general area of where the children are  playing so if he has to be at his office computer(he works from home but is very flexible) and I am not home he can see the children playing (no pool). And that is another thing, the pool hadn't been out for over a month and half. And how taking pictures of children in swimwear especially when not in public view is against the law.\nWhat bothers me (besides the pictures) is the fact that instead of just coming over and checking with us (we have always been friendly with him in the past) he goes and takes things to the extreme. It also bothers me because their are only 2 people that work in our local country DCSF office and their time could be put to better use.\n\nedit: Thank you all for the replies. I am fairly certain that I want no more contact with this gentleman, and that he honestly didn't care about the children but his own property values and such (his grass is always perfectly cut, whereas mine isn't, toys littering my backyard, etc.). It's my husband that wants to send him a letter, instead of actually confronting him about it. But I agree that trying to handle this ourselves the neighborly way just isn't gonna happen.",

        "content": "**tl;dr** Caught son with friend in sexual act, don't think it's abuse, what do I do?\n\nOh my goodness. Where do I begin. I'm a little embarrassed to share this but I need the advice. I'm not even sure if I should post this. I'm conflicted on how to handle this situation but here goes.\n\nMy son, 11 years old, \"M\", had a sleepover at our house with his almost-11 year old best friend, \"J\". We've done this before with his other friends and this friend many times so we know the drill. Last night was just like all the other times including the normal rambunctious nature the kids have. After dinner and a movie in the living room we say our goodnights and the kids go to my son's room and my husband and I go to our bedroom and we'll all see each other for breakfast. They'll usually watch a movie or play video games or talk or whatever. We'll usually watch TV or read on sleepover nights because we'll end up jarred awake by laughter or noise from the kids anyway. Again all this is normal.\n\nMy husband had to get up early for a meeting so he was beat and fell asleep earlier than usual. Because of this I was prepared to go shush the boys if they got loud so my husband could sleep. And that's where it started getting not-normal. I know it's cliche but there was no noise or laughter and that was suspicious. J and M could have just been quiet or asleep. Maybe there's lingering mommy toddler reaction in me. I'm not quite sure why I did it this way but I quietly approached my son's room. I fool myself into thinking I was trying to be quiet in case they were asleep but if I'm honest I wanted to catch them doing whatever it was they were doing. Not in a scornful way but more of a cool mom \"keep it quiet wink wink\" type of way obviously assuming they were doing something.. well not what they were doing. I consider my relationship with my family and my son very open and trusting so I'm still not quite sure why I did this. I believe my intentions were good. Maybe I was caught up in the sleepover relaxed environment (where some house rules are put aside like dishes so we can have fun with our friends, etc.), I don't know. Maybe I'm over analyzing this part because of the next part.\n\nI get to my son M's room. The hallway light is off but his bedroom light is on and door is about open a little. I hear them quietly talking. We can't see each other yet. But then I hear M giggle a little and J say something like \"yeah I'll do it you, too\". Puzzled I carefully angle so that I can see them, but they still don't see me. I see J laying on my son's bed naked and my son also naked has his head near M's crotch and his head is moving up and down. I freeze, unable to believe what I'm seeing. Thoughts a million miles a second are coming at me. And now for action number two that I cannot understand why I did. I quietly walked away from his room back to mine, laid down, turned off the light and tried to sleep. Tried, anyway.\n\nMaybe an hour later (it's a little past midnight now) I purposefully got up, was loud, turned on the hall light, used the bathroom and loudly walked to my son's room. I knew my loudness would tip them off to stop whatever they were doing. I wasn't going to confront anybody right then but wanted them to know that other people are in the house. However his light and TV were off, they were both dressed again (thank god) and asleep. I went back to bed and eventually fell asleep.\n\nI haven't told my husband yet. I haven't talked to my son. I'm not even sure if I should talk to J. While not super close we know J's parents well so we could talk to them, but not sure if I should.\n\nThis is the part where I'm just lost: what to do.\n\nGoing over the event in my head I feel confident (but not 100% sure) that this wasn't abuse. I didn't see or hear any force, coercion, pleading, or anything like that. I think this is partly why I just slinked away. Granted I only saw or heard maybe 20 seconds (felt like an eternity). M and J are both the same age, have spent a few years as best friends. While my husband and I elected to keep sex an open topic rather than saving up for one big \"the talk\" (that is since M's been pretty young we've always been pretty open about body parts, body functions, sex, abuse, saying no, private parts, masturbation, etc.) I feel like my son has the education to tell abuse for himself, too. Not only is my son getting to *that age* but we've found some (rather innocent) search terms on our computers, and my husband has suspected he's started masturbating, so we know he's certainly curious. I would have zero problem whatsoever about my son being gay. I know many people feel that any sexual act involving minors is necessarily abuse always, but I don't know if I can feel that way. Both my husband and I have had experiences almost as young as my son with other children our age at the time that I don't feel was abusive and didn't lead to any lasting negativity. I feel awkward saying this public but I feel it was even pleasurable when I had those experiences at that age. So I have to consider that this might be a normal, if not a little young, part of his growing up. Obviously because I caught them it changes things.\n\nThat said don't think I'm taking this lightly. Yes, either my son or J could be experiencing abuse somewhere and that scares me. I feel I'll need to talk to my son to find this out. I will admit I have a fear of involving the authorities. I've heard many families and young lives ruined (on the sex offender lists for the rest of lives, indoctrinating counseling, etc.) for incidents not unlike ours. If abuse were present then maybe all of that is worth it, but I'm not convinced there is yet.\n\nIf I go on the assumption it isn't abuse then I don't know if I should tell my husband, either. If my son were 16 and he had a girlfriend over and I caught them in the act the way I'd feel is \"better safe in my house than not safe somewhere else\" and that'd be it. I wouldn't necessarily need to blab to my husband that I found our son sleeping with a girl in our house. Of course he's not 16 he's 11 and his friend is 10 and that makes it different. So: I think I do need to discuss this with my husband.\n\nI'm trying to hide my emotions from my family at the moment so I can think about this. I think about my innocent little guy and how did this happen. But then I think about what I wrote above and have to consider he's not so innocent (or little!) anymore and this is how it goes. I wonder about his friend J. I wonder how did they learn to do that (but then I think playground talk, older siblings, internet, TV/movies, video games, and no longer wonder). I fear if there's abuse involved. I wonder if one of them really did coerce the other. I wonder how my husband will handle this. I wonder if my son is gay. I fear adding sadness and trouble to our family if authorities are involved. I feel like *if* it's not abuse then saying something like \"it's a private thing people do\" isn't *enough* of a response, but then what else can be done? It's not like saying \"you're too young don't do it\" will make any difference.\n\nObviously I'll be and my son will be super embarrassed to talk about this. I don't think it'll be as bad as with some families, though. Like I said above we're pretty open about sex and have had many frank and sometimes funny conversations on the topic so maybe it won't be so bad. But I do think it needs to happen if only because my son is only 11.\n\nSo: any advice? Any similar situations folks have dealt with or heard about? If M were just a little older I feel like I could be more rational about this.\n\nThank you.",

He's started puberty.  You need to teach him about the feelings he's having, and the changes his body is going through.  And you need to talk to him about sex and its place in society.  The way we view male and female roles.  Concepts of consent.  Privacy.  Respect.  Legal issues.  STIs.  How we feel about children and sex.  Sexting.  Why masturbation is usually a better choice when you're very young, versus involving other people in your sexual explorations and discoveries.  Sexual orientation and the assumptions different elements of our society makes about it.  (By the way, just because he was experimenting with his same-gender friend, that doesn't mean he's gay.

My 16yr old sister stuck her head in to ask a question and saw there was someone in my bed (asleep under the covers) she said nothing so that was fine.\n\nThen the next night my older brother came in and saw us in the tv room just after she arrived (waiting for people to go to bed) he seems to have been joining in the bitching even though he frequently has his girlfriend over which I keep quiet about but thats another story.\n\nSo the next morning my 13yr old sister came into my room and saw someone under the covers. Sleeping no nudity. She is a massive pain in the ass, lying, attention seeking, trouble making brat, the lightest way I can put it.\n\nAnyway she goes to my oldest sister (30) and says ''Why is there someone in X's bed'' shes not clueless, shes 13, she has sex ed and everything else, she just wanted to cause trouble.\n\nAnyway mum came home later on and was not happy. Shouting at me with my sister so i couldnt get a word in. She kept saying it was disgraceful and immoral (She was born in 1961 Ireland and is very religious...)\n\nTurns out she is oblivious to everything that goes on with us -.- she thought my brothers girlfriend slept in the spare room when she stayed over (He has his door locked those mornings because he wants to ''sleep in'' lol) Then she was demanding to speak to the girls mother asking me for her phone number (I can't believe she asked that...)\n\nShe was asking what her mother said and I was pissed at being attacked relentlessly by the two of them and said she told her daughter ''be safe'' as opposed to my mum saying to go to a park or field for all she cares.\n\nI understand her being unhappy with what happened. But she is kidding herself thinking my little sister was just confused. And I think how she treated it and me was awful. Especially allowing my basket case of a sister to attack me jointly.\n\nCan any parents give me some more insight here? Was she wrong in how she handled it and what she said?

He asked me \"What if I rubbed my wiener on you?\" I said I don't think I would like that at all, and why would you say something like that?\" He said because K****(my best friends 13 year old son) rubbed his wiener on me last night when we were downstairs alone. I asked him where K**** rubbed it on him, and he starts making a circle motion all over his mouth and said right here. I asked him why he would do that to him and his response was because he hates me. I asked him if K said anything after it happened and he said he told me sorry because I made him. I of course brought this up to the boys mom, and she said that K denied that and it was disgusting why would he do that to a little boy. So she thinks my son is lying to get her boy in trouble. My son has never seen or heard sex be it oral or intercourse, he has never seen a movie with even a girls boobs in it. I have always been fearful of something like this happening to him, because I was molested at the age of 5. So I have warned him that it is not ok for anyone but mom or dad to see or touch his pee pee, but that is the extent of our convo on this. So is it possible for a 4 yr old to make this up? What should I do?\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT*** UPDATE, So I have since gotten my child in to see a child psychologist. There was more to the story than my son offered me initially. This is his story, they were downstairs in the basement with several boys and girls. My friend has 2 boys 13 and 11, and a 12 year old girl. There were two other \"neighbor\" children staying the night both 13 a boy and girl. My son was running around the basement \"game room\" crying that no one wants to play with him and everyone hates him. At some point when their were no adults present, both my friends sons ganged up on my son and tea bagged him. These are his words. K and K both put their wieners on my mouth and M(the neighbor kid) told them to get out of here that is gross. So they got off me and then they lied to me about it and said they didn't do it. I asked him why he didn't come tell me right then, and he said he did tell A(the mom of said boys) that the boys were being naughty. As far as the friendship between her and I, there is no doubt that it is over. After I initially approached her with my concerns, she resorted to bringing things up to try and make my 4 yr old a monster. Like when he not so long ago figured out that girls and boys have different parts, not that he has ever actually seen a girls. One day I was going pee and my son came in the bathroom and asked me if I had a wiener. I told him no. And he just couldn't believe it. He asked me how I went potty, and for lack of better words I told him I just have a hole to pee out of. Yes I realize there may have been a better way to explain that but I was put on the spot and it's not something I had thought out. He always wants to be like me, so his response to that is he wishes he didn't have a wiener and he wanted to have a hole like Mom. I told my friend this story because I found it funny and completely innocent. But she turned it into something bad when she brought up that it might have something to do with my son falsely accusing her kid of something he didn't do. I have not even tried to tell her what happened at the doctors and the conclusion that was made there. I considered paying for both kids to have a polygraph test (600 dollars for both) but I think if it found her kids to be lying she would deny that also. I truly don't believe this was done to my son in a sexual nature, as I mentioned before I think it's just something they do with other kids their age.As someone mention below teabagging is something they talk about in Call of Duty and these kids play these games all the time. Regardless my son was assaulted be it sexual or not. Not one single kid present is going to tell the truth, because they know they would be in big trouble. My sons doctor, doesn't seem to think there is much I can do. Basically it comes down to my sons word against the other boys. And to pursue it in court would just put us through more emotionally than the effect the intial act/attack will have on my son long term. It is agreed by all parties that my son can never be around these kids again. I am thankful that this is the worse thing that happened to my son, because we all know it could have been much worse. I was assured that he will not be effected in the future by this incident. And I have also learned I have a whole lot more explaining to do about how to handle bad guys and bad touches. I hate that these things have to be taught to our children in order to keep them safe, it sucks we live in a world where shit like this happens. I will continue to protect my son as though my life depends on it, because his does.",

She said that she most definitely would need to hear someone of knowledge in this subject confirm my sons accusations before she would get her kid into counseling. And even before counseling for her son she would pay for a polygraph. I am all for the polygraph. We are really close friends and see each other on an almost daily basis. I would have never thought her son capable of this so I understand why she is on the defense.

        "content": "This is a bit long and detailed so excuse the wall of text.  I included a TL;DR for those that want to get to the meat of the situation but reading it all may help to understand how this came to be...\n\n\nBackground.  I am a single father just so everyone knows.  Not important, I know, but in case anyone is wondering.  My 12 year old daughter, I'll refer to her as littlepewpew, goes to a very well respected middle school in our town.  She gets excellent grades and is probably the sweetest thing in the world.  She is very pretty and outgoing, friendly, and treats people with respect when they respect her.\n\nSubject:\nRecently, I could tell something was bothering her.  She was stressed and her grades started to fall.  This is totally not like her.  She started missing assignments in school and generally just going on a downhill slope.  I did the stern father thing and started to get on her about her grades figuring she was just screwing around and she needed to get back to focusing on school work.  I thought it was because she was focusing on internet things too much so I started to revoke her access privileges.  This has been going on for the past 3 weeks or so.\n\n2 nights ago when she was supposed to be doing homework I walked passed her room and I heard her crying.  As most parents would I became concerned and I thought she was just frustrated with the fact that she was losing her privileges so I knocked on the door and went into her room.  I found her lying on her bed sobbing.  Instantly I went into soft, concerned, parent mode.  It was obvious to me that this was more than just the common \"I'm sad because I lost my internet\" crying.  I laid down next to her on her bed and she buried her head into my chest and just started sobbing uncontrollably.  I wrapped my arms around her and began stroking her head to soothe her.  After about 1 minute or so she let me go and I asked her what was wrong.  Her answer couldn't have hit me harder.  \"I think I'm bi.\"\n\nIt took a good 15 seconds for that to sink in and it took everything I was made of to show nothing but compassion on my face.  After another round of hugging and me telling her it didn't matter to me, that I would love her no matter what and explaining to her that she is young and still has a lifetime to figure things out, etc. I asked her what made her think she was bi.  She told me she had a crush on a girl at school.  So we talked about that.  The important thing about the conversation was that she had told one of her friends about how she felt and that friend started to spread the rumor around school.  My brain went into overdrive.  I asked her why she would tell her friend and her answer was innocent.  \"I thought she was my best friend and I wanted to talk to someone about it.\"  Long story short,  It started to get around school and she stopped being friends with that girl.  She has a bunch of other friends that know now but they accept her for who she is and they have been supporting her since.\n\nOn to the hate stalker...As most kids these day internet social media is the thing.  I will not let her have a Facebook account but she wanted a place to share pictures with her friends at school so I let her get a Instagram account.  She has a ton of followers on there and I have some \"spies\" that follow her.  Even though she has her account set to private there are people's daughters on there that I know look at their kids accounts and we all agreed to watch for stuff.  I know some of you are thinking, how could you let your daughter be on there unsupervised?  The answer is I wanted to respect her privacy, or at least let her think she has privacy.  I'm not stupid though, I work in IT and I have a keystroker on her computer so I see everything she types and does.  Though I can't see what she is looking at, I can see what she is typing so of course I look for porn sites and stuff but I started to see some interesting stuff that alerted me.  \"I didn't even do anything to you, leave me alone please.\"  \"Why can't you stop this and just go away.\" things of that nature.  Intrigued by this I started poking around and what I found both surprised me and disgusted me.  Someone from her school made an instagram account with the name \"littlepewpewisafag\" with her picture.  IN that account is some very hateful things.  Calling her a faggot, and ugly, and she should just die in a fire, etc.  My first reaction was to get super angry and kill everyone in the school.  Not literally of course but some serious rage.  They were talking about my baby!!!  As I read further though, I can see that my daughter is handling it very well.  She is not playing into it and is basically dismissing this person as a nuisance.  This is not the first time, either that this kid has done this.  They also have accounts similarly named but with different girls.  Some calling other girls fat and stupid and others just refer to them as a bitch.\n\nI calmed down a bit and took screen shots of the conversations and the hate page so far.  I'm not sure what to do from this point on though.  Since my daughter is handling it, my thoughts are to sit her down and let her know that I know about the page and ask her if she needs me to interfere and based on her answer roll with it.  The other side of me wants to take what I found to the principal and take it to the mattresses.  Get my daughter to tell me the names of everyone involved, get parents involved, and blow the lid off this whole thing.  This is cyber bullying, and hate as clear as the day is long.  I'm looking for some guidance here from parents who may have dealt with this to let me know what they did and whether it worked or not.  If anyone can relate their story to mine please chime in.\n\n**TL;DR** Daughter is on instagram. A hate account referencing her with a picture of her has been put up by some kid at her school.  Asking other parents who may have dealt with this to help me with what to do.\n\nMany thanks to anyone who has something to add.\n\n**Edit** I don't want to turn her out as a snitch, but as I was at lunch I was thinking of possibly creating a throw away gmail account and sending the information to the principal.  Posing as a concerned parent of someone who friends with her so they don't think it is her.  They will probably blame her anyways but this cyber bully has done this with other girls in that school before.\n\n**Edit** Update.  i have reported the account as Abusive / hate on Instagram to get it shut down.  I'm waiting for my daughter to get out of the shower so I can talk to her.  Wish me luck.  I'll update how it went.\n\n**Edit** Update.  So I had the talk with her last night.  It was quite a long talk.  I never realized how much my little girl has grown up.  I admitted to her that I knew about the hate page and at first she thought she was in trouble.  I re-assured her that she was not but that I was very concerned about how this is affecting her.  She was very dignified in her response.  \"I don't care about that daddy.  It's some weirdo trying to get under my skin.  I'm just ignoring it.\"  I asked if it was making her scared to go to school or if it was making her sad and she said no.  I didn't was to seem flippant about it so I asked her if there was anything she wanted me to help with and I gave her the options.  1. Go to the principal and try to flush them out.  2. Send an anonymous email with the screen shots I have.  3. Let her handle it.  She thought about it for a bit and told me that she would handle it by ignoring it and telling her friends to ignore it as well.  \"If we ignore it, they'll get bored and move on.\"  She is friends with the other girls that this person attacked and they all agreed to do the same thing when it happened to the others.  I told her if at any time it starts to bug her, to please let me know and I'll take action to protect her.  We talked a little bit more about it but that was the gist of it.  I was really paying attention to her voice inflection and her body language and she seemed very relaxed and confident.  I explained to her about the pitfalls of social media and she listened but I got the feeling like she already knew.\n\nAs far as the bi-sexual thing, we talked about that as well.  I re-assured her that she has plenty of time to figure all that out and that whatever she decides down the road will be okay with me.  I'll still love her no matter what.  I told her not to rush into anything and to always respect her body and be safe.  But most of all, take your time.  Don't be in a rush to explore this.  Sex should be the last thing on her mind.  She has her school work and friends and all sorts of things to do.  She listened and it seemed like a big weight was lifted.\n\nI want to thank everyone for all your advice.  I think I over reacted.  What do you expect though?  She is my angel and my life.  When I think someone is trying to hurt her I go all beast mode and want to murder people.  I didn't give her the benefit of the doubt that she is maturing both emotionally and in life in general.\n\nFinally, to any parent who ever has to go through this.  Keep an open mind about the situation and talk to your kids.  It seems to me in today's society kids are smartening up about the internet.  Social media is to kids toady as going outside to play was to us.  We knew not to talk to strangers, not to help anyone find their \"lost puppy\", to avoid parked cars that had people in them, to cross the street when it was safe etc.  They know how to deal with trolls.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "I'm a 6th grade teacher and I have to deal with things like this much too often.\n\nDo not let you daughter deal with this alone. Alert the principal, get the names of the bullies.\n\nI don't know if the same laws apply where you live, but cyber bullying is a crime here in Quebec. We often get the police involved in those case, especially when the bully's parents won't cooperate. Kids under 14 won't actually get prosecuted, but cops will scare them and make it very clear that bullying is illegal.\n\nGood luck.",

        "content": "I'm a single dad, and I'm quite protective. I came home from work yesterday and (as I usually do) went up to her room to say hi. For whatever reason I forgot to knock, and was greeted with a sight that left nothing to the imagination.\nObviously it's my fault for not knocking, and things were awkward at the dinner table.\n\nThey're both of age, and I know the boyfriend quite well (they've been together for about half a year now), so I'm not worried in that respect. But it's the first time I've had to deal with something like this. I feel like we should talk about it, but I don't know what to say. They weren't using protection (as I say, nothing was left to the imagination), but I don't know whether or not she's on birth control. She's also never been to the lady doctor. Should I be discouraging this, encouraging this, or what? I'd feel partially responsible if I did nothing and she ended up pregnant.\n\nIf she's having sex I'd much rather she did it somewhere she feels safe, with someone she feels safe with. Also, I don't have a 'moral' objection to responsible teenagers having sex if they want to - it's an important, fun part of a relationship.\n\nSo basically, should I broach the subject, and if so, how? How has anyone else dealt with this situation before?",

        "content": "ok first things first. A little background. Sorry this is a lot long. Lots to go over.\n\nSo there I was with the perfect child. Aside from grades I had the perfect child. Super respectful of everyone. Very trustworthy. Honest, etc. Worst thing i can even think to say of him was he was occasionally clumsy.\n\nThen He hit 15... wtf. I'm pretty sure he was replaced with an evil clone. Within 6 months it was a completely new child living in our house. I left him and his sister alone for a weekend. Having done 1 nighters a few times before I felt very comfortable with it. The breakdown of our worst weekend EVER.\n\n1 - Stole my truck ( no license, permit or ever driven a vehicle larger than a quad in his life. ) \n2 - Put 5 friends in my truck. Got pulled over, talked his way out of it.\n3 - 2 HUGE, im talkin cars lined up for 2 blocks huge party's.\n     A ) I had the neighbors watching the house. He went to each of before the parties and told them i had said he could have a party so they shouldnt be concerned. He is so gifted with bullshit.\n4 - LOTS of booze and drugs\n5 - Friends having sex on my living room floor.\n6 - Steals my truck again to drive 2 hours away to drop friends from parties off. Truck breaks down, I get call from cops asking me when i plan on getting my truck off the highway.\n\nThe wrath of jesus fell upon him for that one.\n\nNext he brings home a report card with 7 F's... im not talkin like scraping the D line here. im talkin like 4%. Im pretty sure you get more than 4 % if you are breathing in class but he managed it.\n\nPunishment - Dad took his vacation from work and went to school with him for 2 weeks. Sat in every class, ate every lunch etc... Grades came back up for a little while.\n\nNext - Absolutely NEEDED a corndog from the deli. Stole it, got busted.\n\nPunishment - Had them arrest him to spend the weekend in Jail.\n\nNext - Stole a bicycle. \n\nPunishement - Dad put him in jail for 33 days. Conditions for my letting him out. I wanted written statements from the officers there that he was the best inmate they had ever had. He did this.\n\nHe is now on probation for 3 years as a result of all this.\n\nNext - got low grades again so I went to take his cell phone from him. Before i could get it out of his hands he locked it with a password. Instantly i knew something was on there that he didnt want me to see. I demand that he unlock the phone. He refuses telling me its none of my business. Ya thats not gonna work. So i call the phone company and get it reset. Inside...\n\nTons of naked pictures of his 15 yr old girlfriend. Text messages of a plan for his girlfriends mother to come pick him up at 2 am on a friday at the local park because he has convinced her that i beat him and he is afraid for his life. He told the same thing to 6 other friends seeing if they could help him. And found a text conversation with his girlfriend telling him she is pregnant. WTF...\n\nI think what pissed me off the most was the telling me it was none of my business and flat ass defying me. Anyhow as it was a violation of his probation i reported him to his P.O. and we scheduled him to be picked up the following afternoon. So he called the police and said i had just gotten done beating him up and he needed help. GRRRRR.\n\nCops came saw nothing had been done and left.\n\nSo thats where we were up till about 2 months ago. Here is where i got creative.\n\nI desperately didnt want him to go back to jail to hang out with his friends. I dont want his future so trashed by teenage stupidity that he cannot have a quality life because he is followed by his decisions. So I came up with a plan. \n\nWeek 1 - Complete isolation from the rest of the family. I asked the police when he came what I am required by law to provide for my children. He said, a warm safe house. Food, clothing & his basic needs met. NICE. That means every single other thing that he believes is a right of his or a possession of his or an entitlement he feels is owed to him is in fact a privilege. \n\nI packed up every single thing that I was letting him borrow with the exception of 5 days worth of school clothes, 1 pillow, 1 blanket his tooth brush and toothpaste & Floss. He was allowed to keep all his school related items.  Then i put it in the garage. He could sleep on the couch or the floor. His dresser was mine so his clothes could be kept stacked neatly on the floor. If he failed to stack them neatly on the floor he would lose any clothes that were not stacked neatly on the floor.\n\nHis sister was not allowed to talk to him during this week. I would not talk to him during this week. For all intents and purposes we were to act like he was already in jail. You dont get love in jail. If he had something to say to me he would call me sir or i would not respond to him. He was not allowed to leave his room for any reason other than to clean himself or cook his meal/eat or school. His room is larger than a jail cell, but i think he got the point. \n\nThe point of this was to not only remind him of what life in jail was like. But to completely cut him off from all forms of caring. I wanted him to know that he was alienating himself from his family and what it would be like when the line had finally been crossed and no one would be there to pick up his pieces. And most importantly i wanted him to be in a place where he would go along with the contract and be ready to do anything to end his current circumstances.\n\nI think this was the hardest week he or i have ever had. Keep in mind, this kid is my best friend in the entire world. I love him absolutely.\n\nDuring this week I wrote up a contract. I had talked to his probation officer and both of us decided that jail doesnt really do anything and I asked if i wrote up a contract would he be willing to accept that. He said sure as long as it was meaningful. So i went to work. \n\nThe following is where i would like your feedback if possible. This is my first tough love experiment and i came up with this on my own having no experience in this area at all. \n\nThe following reply is the contract i wrote for this.",
        "most_upvoted_comment": "_______________________ The Contract ________________________\n\n\nThe Rules\nHow you can earn your way back\n\nDear son,\nYou have nothing at the moment. You do not have any rights other than the following.\n1) The right to be safe.\n2) The right to eat\n3) The right to have your needs met\nEverything else is a priveledge. You have earned every part of your current punishment by your refusal to obey the law & the rules of this house. You do not own any possessions. I own everything you had.\nThis plan will not take affect until you come to your sister & myself and apologize for everything you have done. I expect to hear a sincere apology for the incredible amount of stress and pain you have placed on this family. I expect to hear you take responsibility for all you have done and provide me with a plan on how you will repair the damage you have done. With no excuses and no blaming of others for your actions.\nThats the bad news...\nHere is the good news...\nYou can have it all back. But you will need to earn it just as you have earned what you have now. It will not be easy. It will take a very long time. You will be required to comply 100%  to every single rule of this house. \nWe will be using a point system for you to \"buy\" back your priveldges. Every point you earn will be put towards buying either a period of limited freedom or an item you own back. Every item that I have previously loaned to you can be returned to you if you get enough points to buy them back. Each item will cost 50 points. For example... the handle bars on the bicycle that you used to own will cost you 50 points to get back. The frame will cost another 50 points. and so on. When you have completed buying back the bicycle you may earn 30 minutes more time for another 10 points. This 30 minutes will be a 1 time purchase. Ie... you are not buying 30 minutes every day. you are buying a single 30 minute period of time.\n\nBest of all. It is really easy to earn your points. All you have to do is the following. For each task you will earn 1 point.\n\n1) Do what is asked of you imediately the first time you are asked.\n2) Do each task you are given to the very best of your ability. \n\tA - For example, if you are asked to clean the kitchen. The best of your ability would \t    \tbe to ensure that every surface of the kitchen is cleaned. Not just doing the dishes \tbut the entire kitchen. \n3) You do not in any way backtalk or argue with a task you have been given to do.\n4) You will be required to let me know when you have completed each task assigned to you so that i can inspect it and award you points.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a catch. The following is how you will lose points.\n1) If you fail to strictly follow any of the above requirements\n2) If you lie - for each lie you tell you will be required to give back the last possession you earned.\n3) If you are disrespectful to any member of this family.\n4) If you fail to comply with any law of society.\n5) If you have to be told more than one time to do a task.\n6) If you fail to be honest with me about anything.\n\tA) This means that if i find out that you were involved in anything bad from anyone before I hear it \tfrom you. You will lose the last possession you earned.\n\nFor each of the above offenses you will be charged 2 points for failure to comply. If you backtalk or try to make any excuses when charged you will be charged 5 points.\n\nYou may earn extra points by the following...\n1)  For each homework assignment you bring home with a 100% score. You will earn an extra 2 points.\n2) For every test you bring proof of recieving 100% you will earn an extra 5 points.\n3) Doing a given task exceptionally well.\n4) Doing a task in a timely manner.\n5) Having a good attitude while doing these tasks.\n\nI realize that you may be unwilling to comply with this plan. And that is your decision. Unfortunately it is the only way in which I will allow you to regain the trust, possessions, freedom and respect you have lost. The point of this is not to further punish you but to give you an oportunity to earn your way out of the punishment you are currently in. The hope is that when this is done. Not only will you realize that as a citizen of the world you are required to follow its laws. But that you understand that my job as a parent is to make you the best citizen I possibly can. You were given the freedom to try things your way. Clearly that way failed. Now we will do it my way. \n\nPlease don't forget. I am not doing this to you. I am doing this for you. Because as much as you do not believe it.\n\nI love you,\nyour father\n\nYour Signature_____________________            Dad's Signature_____________________\nDate:__________\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\nHis response has been overwhelmingly awesome. His entire life has become about the points. He never forgets and has for 2 months now had the most amazing attitude about everything. He has managed to almost completely buy back his bike and MP3 player. I was worried this would further harm our relationship by alienating him more than he already was. but i have to say its astonishing the changes it has made in him. not like before all this... better than before. But most importantly, he is learning the value of everything he has. He is learning that I am in fact the parent, i do in fact have control of him. And he is in fact responsible for every single action good or bad he does. I dont have to stress about anything. there is no yelling, no anger. If he does badly we bring out the contract that is stapled to his empty walls and i point it out.... according to here, this is a violation of our contract - 2 points or whatever. He knows what he did and agrees. As harsh as this is. it has brought us closer because there is no more screaming or anger. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read this super long winded post.",
