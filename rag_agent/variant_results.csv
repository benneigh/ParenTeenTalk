Have you heard the word ""virginity"" before? It's okay if you haven't. Virginity is just a way some people talk about whether someone has had sex yet, but what really matters is understanding your own feelings and respecting others. If you have any questions or feel curious about these things, I'm here to talk anytime. It's normal to have questions as you grow, and I want you to know you can always come to me.
Child: Uh, yeah, I’ve heard of it. But, like, why does it matter? I mean, I guess it’s cool to know we can talk about it.
Parent: Parent: That's a great question! For some people, virginity is important because it might be tied to personal beliefs or cultural values. But what's most important is how you feel about it and understanding that everyone might think about it differently. It's not something you need to worry about right now, but I want you to feel comfortable asking questions whenever you have them. Just know that being respectful to yourself and others is key as you learn more about this stuff.
Child: Okay, I get it. Thanks for explaining, Mom.
