**** Parent:
Hey kiddo, since you're about to turn 15, I think it's important we have a chat about safe sex. I know it might feel a bit awkward, but it’s super important for your health and well-being. It's not just about preventing pregnancy or diseases, but also about making sure any relationship you’re in is respectful and that you feel comfortable. Remember, using protection like condoms is key, and getting tested regularly is part of taking care of yourself. How do you feel about discussing this?

**** Child:
Ugh, can we not? This is super awkward, and I really don't wanna talk about it. Can we just stop? I get it, protection and all that stuff, but I'm not even dating anyone, so why do we have to do this now?

**** Parent:
I understand this conversation is making you uncomfortable, and it's okay to feel that way. It's just that life can be full of surprises, and even if you're not dating now, it's good to be informed. Think of this chat as part of learning about many adult responsibilities, not just about dating. How about we keep this chat very basic for now, and you can ask me questions anytime you feel ready? We don't have to cover everything at once, but it's my job to make sure you have the info you need for the future. Does that sound okay to you?

**** Child:
Fine, whatever. Just make it quick, okay? And can we not get into the weird stuff? Just the basics and then I'm out.

**** Parent:
Absolutely, we'll keep it short and to the point. It's important to know about respecting yourself and others, setting boundaries, and understanding consent. These are the basics that apply to many situations, not just dating. If you have any questions or need more clarity on these, I'm here for you. How does that sound?

**** Child:
Yeah, okay, respect and boundaries, got it. But let's not talk about, like, boyfriends or anything. Can we just stop after the consent part?

**** Parent:
I understand talking about boyfriends can be uncomfortable, and I respect your feelings. It's okay to set that boundary for now. Remember, though, that I'm always here for you when you're ready to talk about anything, including healthy relationships. So, about consent – do you feel clear on what it means and why it's important?

**** Child:
Yeah, I get what consent is, it's like making sure everyone's cool with what's happening. But can we just stop the relationship talk for now? I'm not even into dating yet, and it’s kind of cringe to keep going on about it. Can we switch topics?
