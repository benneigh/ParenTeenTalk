**** Parent:
Hey sweetie, since you're going to be 15 soon, I think it's time we have a talk about safe sex. I want you to know that this is about keeping you healthy and safe, not about me trying to control your choices. It's really important that you understand how to protect yourself, including using things like condoms, and why it's a good idea to be informed about STDs. How do you feel about discussing this?

**** Child:
I understand it's important, but can we keep this talk pretty general? I'm not really comfortable getting into specifics, especially since I'm not in that situation right now.

**** Parent:
Absolutely, we can definitely keep the conversation general. It's all about making sure you have the right information for when you need it. So, let's discuss the importance of respecting yourself and others, and why it's essential to make choices that are best for your health and well-being. If you ever do have specific questions or need advice, remember I'm here for you. Is there anything on your mind right now that you'd like to ask about or any topic you're curious about in a general sense?

**** Child:
I guess talking about respect and making good choices is okay. I don't really have questions right now, but I'll ask if something comes up. Can we stop soon? I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed.

**** Parent:
Absolutely, we can stop here. It's good to recognize when you need a break. When you're ready or if something specific comes to mind, we can pick up from where we left off. Remember, I'm always here for you. How about we do something relaxing now? What would you like to do?

**** Child:
Thanks for understanding, I think I'd like to draw or listen to some music to chill out.

**** Parent:
Drawing and listening to music both sound like perfect ways to relax. Go ahead and pick which one feels right for you at the moment. If you want, I can join you or if you prefer some alone time, that's okay too. Just enjoy yourself and let the creativity flow.

**** Child:
Thanks for the offer, but I think I'd like some alone time to draw and listen to music by myself.

**** Parent:
Absolutely, having some time to yourself is really valuable. I'll make sure you have a quiet space to enjoy your drawing and music. If you need anything or just want to talk later on, I'm here for you. Enjoy your alone time, sweetheart.

**** Child:
Thanks, I'll let you know if I need anything.

**** Parent:
That sounds great. You know, I'm proud of you for taking this time for yourself. It's important to recharge. And hey, if there's ever anything on your mind, whether it's something that made you happy or something that's bothering you, I'm here to listen. We can talk about anything, anytime.

**** Child:
Thanks, Mom/Dad. I appreciate it. I might take you up on that sometime.

**** Parent:
Absolutely, anytime you feel like talking, I'm here. And you know, it's completely normal to have ups and downs, especially at your age. Life can get pretty intense. If you ever want to bring up anything specific, like how often your friends come over, including a boyfriend or anyone else, just know we can talk about it openly and figure things out together.

**** Child:
Thanks for being there, but can we please stop talking about boyfriends and stuff? It makes me uncomfortable.

**** Parent:
Absolutely, I'm sorry if that topic made you uncomfortable. We don't have to talk about it if you don't want to. Just remember, whatever is on your mind, I'm here to listen and help, no matter what it's about. Is there something else you'd like to talk about or anything on your mind that's been bothering you lately?

**** Child:
Yeah, thanks for understanding. Can we maybe talk about something else? Like, I've been really into this new art project at school and it's been pretty cool.

**** Parent:
I'm really proud of you for diving into your art project. Tell me more about it. What are you creating? And what do you like most about working on it?

**** Child:
Yeah, the art project is cool, we're doing this big mural. I'm really into the painting part, getting all the colors to blend just right. It's like all my ideas just explode on the wall, you know? But, can we stop talking about it now? I wanna do something else.
