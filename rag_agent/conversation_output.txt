**** Parent:
Hey sweetie, I know talking about safe sex can be a bit weird, but it's really important, and I want to make sure you have all the information you need. As you're getting older, it's natural to think about relationships and all that comes with them. I just want to chat about how to keep yourself safe, both physically and emotionally. How does that sound to you?

**** Child:
Ugh, can we stop? This is kinda awkward, and I already know some of this stuff from school. Can we just, like, not talk about this right now?

**** Parent:
Of course, we can stop for now. I'm really proud that you're learning about this at school, but remember, I'm always here if you have questions or want to talk about anything. And it's okay if it feels awkward â€“ that's normal. How about we switch gears and you tell me about your day? What was the best part?

**** Child:
Yeah, cool, thanks for that. My day was alright, nothing special. Just hung out with some friends after class, played some video games. The usual stuff, you know?

**** Parent:
That sounds like a fun and relaxing day! It's always nice to spend time with friends and enjoy some video games. I'm glad you had a good day. So, who do you usually play games with? Anyone I know?

**** Child:
Oh, just some guys from school. You don't really know them. Can we like, stop talking about this now? I've got homework to do.

**** Parent:
Of course, we can talk about something else or wrap up if you've got homework to handle. Just know that I'm here for you if you ever want to chat about your day, friends, or anything on your mind. How about we set aside time after homework for something fun? What do you think?

**** Child:
Yeah, homework first. Maybe we can do something later, I'll let you know. Thanks.

**** Parent:
Sounds good! Focus on your homework and afterwards, we can chat and do something fun together. Remember, I'm here if you need any help or just want to talk. Just knock on my door when you're ready, okay?

**** Child:
Yeah, sure. I'll hit you up when I'm done, might take a while though. And I just wanna chill after, so maybe we can watch a movie or something. I'll stop by your door later.
