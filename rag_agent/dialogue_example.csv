T15-I1-V1-E2,Child,"Ugh, do we have to talk about this right now?",continue,
T15-I1-V1-E3,Parent,"I get it, it might not be the most fun topic, but it's really important. Consent is all about making sure we’re always respecting others and ourselves. How about we just chat for a few minutes, and you can ask me anything if you're curious?",,
T15-I1-V1-E4,Child,"Fine, but can't we talk about it later? I'm kinda busy right now.",continue,
T15-I1-V1-E5,Parent,"I totally understand you're busy, so let's keep it quick. Just remember, consent is like a mutual agreement where everyone involved feels good about what's happening. It's super important because it helps build trust and respect. We can chat more about it when you have some time. Sound good?",,
T15-I1-V1-E6,Child,"Okay, but can we just do this later? I really gotta finish this game.",continue,
T15-I1-V1-E7,Parent,"Alright, how about this—when you're done with your game, just let me know and we can chat for a few minutes.

T15-I1-V2-E4,Child,"Fine, but can we keep it quick? I kinda have other things to do.",continue,
T15-I1-V2-E5,Parent,"Alright, let's keep it quick. So, the main thing about consent is that it's all about making sure everyone involved is comfortable and agrees to what's happening. It's really important that both people say yes and feel okay about it. If someone isn't sure or says no, then it's not okay to go ahead. Does that make sense so far?",,
T15-I1-V2-E6,Child,"Yeah, I guess that makes sense. Can I go now?",continue,
T15-I1-V2-E7,Parent,"Okay, you can go in a moment. Just remember, consent isn't just about saying yes or no in big situations.

T15-I1-V3-E5,Parent,"I get that you want to move on, but it's really important to me that you understand this. How about we just chat a little bit more? Consent isn't just about saying 'yes' or 'no.' It's also about feeling safe and respected in any situation. Does that make sense to you?",,

T15-I1-V4-E3,Parent,"Sure, you can go play soon. I just wanted to have a quick chat about this. Consent is like when you're playing a game, and you ask if everyone wants to join or if they're okay with the rules. It's important to make sure everyone is comfortable and happy with what's happening. Does that make sense?",,
T15-I1-V4-E4,Child,"Okay, I get it. Can I go now?",continue,
T15-I1-V4-E5,Parent,"I know you're eager to go play, and I promise this won't take much longer.

T15-I1-V5-E3,Parent,"I know it's not the most exciting topic, but it's really important to understand consent so you can make good decisions and respect others. We can keep it short today, and if you have questions later, we can always chat again. Plus, I made your favorite cookies, so it won’t be all serious talk. How does that sound?",,
T15-I1-V5-E4,Child,"Fine, but only if I can take the cookies to my room after.",continue,
T15-I1-V5-E5,Parent,"Alright, deal! So, when we talk about consent, it's all about making sure both people are comfortable and agree to what's happening. It's important in friendships, relationships, and really any situation where you're making decisions together. We can take it slow, and you can ask me anything that pops up. Let's grab those cookies and get started!",,
T15-I1-V5-E6,Child,Can we just skip to the part where I take the cookies to my room?,continue,
T15-I1-V5-E7,Parent,"Alright, how about this? We’ll have a quick chat while we munch on the cookies. You know, understanding consent is like setting the rules when you play a game. Everyone needs to agree before starting, and it's okay to change your mind. It’s a way to make sure everyone feels safe and respected.

T15-I1-V6-E3,Parent,"I get it, buddy. We can definitely talk about it later. Just let me know when you're ready. It's an important topic, but we can take it slow and talk a bit at a time whenever you feel like it.",,

T15-I1-V7-E3,Parent,"I understand it might not be the most fun topic, but it's really important. As you start making more friends, knowing about respecting each other’s boundaries can help you have good friendships. We can keep it short, I promise. What do you think?",,
T15-I1-V7-E4,Child,"Okay, but can we do it super quick? I kinda wanna finish my game.",continue,
T15-I1-V7-E5,Parent,"Alright, let's make it quick! So, when we talk about consent, it's really about making sure everyone is comfortable and agrees to what's happening, like when you're playing games with your friends and you all agree on the rules.

T15-I1-V8-E3,Parent,"I understand you'd rather play, but this is important, and it won't take long. You know how sometimes I need to say yes or no to things you want to try? That's because as you get older, there are some decisions where having a bit more guidance is really helpful. Let's talk a little bit about why that's a good thing, and then you can go play.",,
T15-I1-V8-E4,Child,"Ugh, fine. Can we make it quick though?",continue,
T15-I1-V8-E5,Parent,"Alright, let's keep it quick. You know how when you want to join a new team or try something new at school, I need to sign a form or give my permission? That's because I want to make sure you're safe and ready for it. It's similar when it comes to other big decisions as you get older. It's important to have guidance and know when it's okay to say yes or no to things. Does that make sense?",,
T15-I1-V8-E6,Child,"I guess so, but can't you just trust me to know when to ask you stuff?",continue,
T15-I1-V8-E7,Parent,"I do trust you, buddy, but remember, asking for guidance on some things is just part of growing up. Like when it comes to understanding stuff about consent and making sure everyone feels comfortable and safe, it's helpful to talk it out together.

Remember, it's important to consider not just what feels right for you but also to check if the other person feels comfortable too. It's about mutual respect.

T15-I2-V3-E4,Child,"Yeah, I guess.",continue,
T15-I2-V3-E5,Parent,"I'm glad it makes sense to you. It's also important to remember that consent can change. Just because someone agreed to something before doesn't mean they're always okay with it.

It's all about making sure everyone is on the same page and happy with the plan. That's kind of like practicing consent. Does that help it feel a bit less weird?",,
