My feet are huge now, and I'm bumping my head on stuff I used to walk under just fine. It's exciting but also a bit embarrassing. My friends keep making fun of how I tower over them now, and I feel awkward sometimes.",

It happens at the worst times—like when I'm answering a question in class or trying to talk to someone I like. I'm both annoyed and kind of relieved, because at least I know I'm going through puberty!",

It's so overwhelming—cramps, mood swings, and just trying to deal with the new reality that this is going to happen every month. I feel like I should've been more prepared but I'm still kind of in shock.",

I’m 12, almost 13, and my parents say it's normal, but I don't feel normal. One day I'm so excited and motivated, and the next day I just want to isolate myself in my room. Anyone else going through this?",
